                <head>Letter from the General Editor</head>
                <p xml:lang="en">2022 marks the silver jubilee of <hi rend="italic"
                        >Hugoye: Journal of Syriac Studies</hi>. The initial idea was born in 1996
                    to provide the field with a journal dedicated solely to Syriac. The <hi
                        rend="italic">electronic</hi> (now we would say <hi rend="italic"
                        >digital</hi>) format was a novelty at the time. The term “open access” was
                    not coined yet. Twenty-five years later, both the format and the business
                    model—being freely available online—seem normative, rather preferable. It has
                    been a long journey of 25 years since the first issue appeared in January 1998.
                    As <foreign xml:lang="syr">ܚܛܘܪ ܣܝܒܘܬܐ</foreign> seems
                    to be looming on the horizon, the time has come to hand the <foreign xml:lang="syr">ܚܘܛܪܐ</foreign> over. I will be stepping
                    down as General Editor after we publish volume 25. </p>
                <p xml:lang="en">It gives me pleasure to announce that the Trustees of Beth Mardutho have invited
                    Jeanne-Nicole Mellon Saint-Laurent of Marquette University to serve as the next
                        <hi rend="italic">Hugoye</hi> General Editor, to be supported by James
                    Walters and Hannah Stork as Associate Editors. The Beth Mardutho Trustees
                    determined that the editorial committee shall serve a five-year renewable
                    term.</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">Jeanne-Nicole is an Associate Professor at the Theology Department (Historical
                    Theology) at Marquette University. She is well known in Syriac studies for her
                    scholarship, passion for advancing our field, and devotion to the heritage
                    community. I had the privilege of knowing Jeanne-Nicole while she was a graduate
                    student at Brown University and have followed her academic career ever since.
                    Her graduate studies culminated in <hi rend="italic">Missionary Stories and the
                        Formation of the Syriac Churches</hi> (Berkeley: University of California
                    Press, 2015), which received an award from the Hagiography Society in 2018. She
                    co-authored with Kyle R. Smith <hi rend="italic">The History of Mar Behnam and
                        Sarah: Martyrdom and Monasticism in Medieval Iraq</hi> (Piscataway: Gorgias
                    Press, 2018). Jeanne-Nicole has become a leading member among the Syriac
                    scholars advancing the Digital Humanities. She is the co-editor of the
                    Bibliotheca Hagiographica Syriaca Electronica, better known to us as the <ref
                        target="https://syriaca.org/bhse/index.html">Qadishe portal</ref> at <ref
                        target="https://syriaca.org/index.html">syriaca.org</ref>. Jeanne-Nicole’s
                    dedication to the community is no less impressive. She organized the 2005 Beth
                    Mardutho trip to the Tur Abdin. She is also credited with establishing Dorushe
                    group, which gives graduate students—usually scattered in <foreign xml:lang="syr">ܐܪܒܥ ܦܢܝ̈ܢ</foreign>, the four corners of
                    the earth—a sense of community.</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">I also had the privilege of following the academic careers of James Walters and
                    Hannah Stork. James joined the <hi rend="italic">Hugoye</hi> team as an
                    Assistant Editor back in 2011 and then as an Associate Editor since 2020. In
                    addition, he was an integral part of the local Beth Mardutho team in Piscataway
                    during his graduate studies at Princeton Theological Seminary between 2010 and
                    2015 and became involved in many Beth Mardutho projects. His scholarly work on
                    Aphrahat is known to many of us. A project to encode its text in XML TEI led
                    James to move <hi rend="italic">Hugoye</hi> from static HTML4 format to TEI
                    encoding starting with volume 20, advancing the journal’s computational
                    capabilities. James is also the General Editor of the <ref
                        target="https://syriaccorpus.org/index.html">Digital Syriac Corpus</ref>. He
                    is currently Syriac Manuscript Cataloguer at HMML. He recently edited <hi
                        rend="italic">Eastern Christianity: A Reader</hi> (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans,
                    2021), thus making <hi rend="italic">our</hi> literature known to the broader
                    public.</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">Hannah Stork is currently a graduate student at Yale University, having obtained
                    a Masters degree from the University of Chicago. She was the Dr. Talal and Mrs.
                    Wesal Findakly Fellow in the Digital Humanities at Beth Mardutho in 2018. Hannah
                    brings to <hi rend="italic">Hugoye</hi> remarkable philological skills in
                    Classical Syriac and languages in contact with Syriac: Arabic (including
                    Garshuni), Neo-Aramaic, Hebrew, Middle Persian, Geʿez, and Coptic, in addition
                    to Greek and Latin. She joined the Beth Mardutho Syriac language summer school
                    as Teacher Assistant in 2020. Hannah is also a member of the English Translation
                    Review Committee of the Antioch Bible.</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">One cannot hope for a better team of succession.</p>
                <p style="text-align: center;">܀.܀.܀</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">I must admit that the establishment of <hi rend="italic">Hugoye</hi> was, for me,
                    an act of Suryoyutho. All significant fields of study had peer-reviewed
                    journals. This included computational linguistics, the domain of my Ph.D.
                    research which also had <hi rend="italic">Computational Linguistics</hi> as its
                    premier journal. However, Syriac scholarship had no dedicated journal and relied
                    on publishing its content in journals of neighboring fields. The purpose of <hi
                        rend="italic">Hugoye</hi> was to provide for Syriac studies its journal
                    across time and space, across all disciplines: if it is Syriac, we are
                    interested! Soon, I would realize that this is easier said than done.</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">The field—at least from my perspective of Suryoyutho—had a bit of an identity
                    crisis that I did not realize when <hi rend="italic">Hugoye</hi> was
                    established. I came from a community of computational linguists who—as most
                    academic communities are—live in their bubble and thus have their own premier
                    journal. The Syriac studies community was different. There was no bubble; there
                    was no journal.</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">My entry to the Syriac studies community was in 1988 when I attended the Vtum
                    Symposium Syriacum. I failed to notice during the ten years between that event
                    and the establishment of <hi rend="italic">Hugoye</hi> that the majority of the
                    active scholars in the field did not hold <hi rend="italic">Syriac
                        positions</hi> in the Academy. They were biblical scholars, historians,
                    early Christian scholars, or specialists of neighboring fields. They just
                    happened to do Syriac. There were exceptions, of course; Sebastian Brock was
                    Reader of Aramaic at Oxford University. But this was not the norm.</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">To be sure, not being in a bubble enriches the field of Syriac studies. The
                    diverse backgrounds of its scholars make it such a friendly and fantastic
                    community. But one cannot deny the existence of an identity crisis. We all want
                    to belong elsewhere for practical purposes. My 1993 <hi rend="italic"
                        >Concordance to the Syriac New Testament</hi> had the phrase “A
                    Computer-Generated” prefixed to its official title, albeit in a smaller type,
                    with “Based on the SEDRA database” as a subtitle for one purpose only: to count
                    as a relevant publication in computational linguistics where I was hoping to get
                    a job. We all need to belong elsewhere.</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">This situation became evident—at least to my <foreign xml:lang="syr">ܡܚܝܠܘܬܐ</foreign>—with the launch of <hi
                        rend="italic">Hugoye</hi>. The Academy demanded that scholars, especially
                    the younger ones, publish in the reputable journals of those other specific
                    fields, not in a start-up journal and—for crying out loud—an <hi rend="italic"
                        >electronic</hi> one.</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">And the electronic format was a problem. We needed to convince scholars of the
                    mid-late 1990s that peer-reviewed content and not format determine a journal’s
                    quality. Many viewed a paper journal as more reputable than an electronic one.
                    We twisted arms to persuade scholars to submit content, at least for the first
                    ten years of the journal. I must pause here and offer a word of gratitude to
                    those who humored me at the time (I had just defended my Ph.D. thesis) and
                    agreed to join the editorial board of this electronic start-up. I especially
                    thank those scholars who took the time to contribute papers, knowing well in
                    advance that what they wrote on a computer will most likely remain digital and
                    may never see the ink of a press.</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">I must also thank the Department of Semitics at The Catholic University of
                    America, in the persons of Sydney Griffith and Monica Blanchard, for providing a
                    digital home for <hi rend="italic">Hugoye</hi> during its first 15 years or so.
                    (If I recall correctly, the Peshitta Institute of Leiden provided—or at least
                    was ready to provide—a mirror site when mirror sites were a thing.) Much later,
                    the <ref target="https://srophe.app/">Srophé app</ref>
                    provided the technical framework for encoding <hi rend="italic">Hugoye</hi> in
                    TEI XML rendered into HTML5 as output.</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">Thomas Joseph was <hi rend="italic">Hugoye</hi>’s first Technical Editor (we
                    would call him today Digital Humanities Editor). He single-handedly encoded the
                    first 11 volumes, first in HTML 3.2 (up to issue 4.1), then XHTML 1.0 with CSS
                    (up to issue 7.1), and finally HTML 4.0 (up to issue 11.2). The initial volumes
                    were encoded using a simple text editor. Those were not the days when the text
                    editor autocompleted HTML elements or closed their tags for you automatically.
                    Moreover, those were not the days when text editors checked the syntax of your
                    code and gave you warnings. Encoding was then an art in its own right. Thomas’s
                    contributions were not limited to encoding. He also corresponded with authors
                    and copyedited final submissions. His tenure lasted until volume 15.</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">Monica Blanchard served as the first Book Review Editor. Kristian Heal succeeded
                    her. Ute Possekel of Harvard Divinity School, the current Book Review Editor,
                    enriched this journal section and brought it to international standards. One
                    cannot hope for a better Book Review Editor.</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">The backlog of <hi rend="italic">Hugoye</hi> is still being converted into TEI
                    XML. Many summer Digital Humanities fellows of Beth Mardutho contributed to this
                    work. Joss Childs, one such fellow, is now the Digital Humanities Editorial
                    Assistant.</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">A positive byproduct of the <hi rend="italic">Hugoye</hi> journal is hugoye-list.
                    We initially created it as a compliment to the journal to provide a space for
                    scholars to discuss and comment on the journal’s content. Despite this,
                    hugoye-list took a life of its own and became the de-facto discussion list for
                    Syriac studies. I thank all of those active on the list and helped create a
                    virtual Syriac studies environment.</p>

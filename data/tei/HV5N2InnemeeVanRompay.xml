         <p>In the period October 2001-January 2002 conservation work
    and research continued in the church of the Holy Virgin in Deir
    al-Surian (Wadi al-Natrun, Egypt).<ref target="#FN1">1</ref> As in previous seasons,
    eighteenth-century plaster was removed from a number of walls,
    revealing mural paintings and inscriptions. The first part of
    this report will be devoted to the description of the
    wall-paintings and to some observations on the architecture of
    the church. In the second part the new Syriac texts will
    briefly be presented.</p>
    
    
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P1"/>[1] During
    the recent campaign a number of paintings and inscriptions were
    uncovered belonging to what we call now layers 2 and 3 of the
    stratigraphy of mural paintings. Layer 2 is supposed to belong
    to the period before the arrival of the first Syrian monks
    (most probably around 800 A.D.), while layer 3 has clear
    symptoms of Syrian influence or authorship.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P2"/>[2] During
    this campaign work was carried out in the <hi rend="italic">khurus</hi>, the
    part of a Coptic church that corresponds more or less to the
    transept in western church architecture. Within this part of
    the church, the focus was on the northern part of the
    <hi rend="italic">khurus</hi> and on the upper part of its eastern wall, just
    under the dome (Fig. 1).</p>

         <head xml:id="HV5N2InnemeeVanRompay1">1. Paintings on layer 2.</head>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P3"/>[3] The
    paintings on the northern wall of the <hi rend="italic">khurus</hi> have a
    layout that corresponds to that of the previously treated
    southern wall: a lower zone with dado-decoration, imitating
    columns and marble inlay work. Over this 2 metre high zone
    there is a level with two blocked windows. Flanking these
    windows there are three panels of mural-painting. Over this
    level there is a painted half-dome, now showing the scene of
    the Dormition of the Virgin, belonging to the fourth layer of
    painting (13<hi rend="sup">th</hi> century). Apart from the dado, which
    has been done in tempera, all the other paintings on layer 2
    uncovered now, have been executed in the encaustic
    technique.</p>
         <head xml:id="HV5N2InnemeeVanRompay2">1.1. Dado-decoration.</head>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P4"/>[4] As in
    the southern <hi rend="italic">khurus</hi>, the lower part of the walls in
    the northern <hi rend="italic">khurus</hi> is decorated with a painted
    pattern of columns, imitation of marble inlay and an architrave
    covered with a red-and-white pattern of triangles. This dado
    continues on the western wall, which has no figurative
    paintings on the higher parts of the wall. After layer 1
    (mostly crosses in red ochre) had been whitewashed over, this
    dado-decoration must have been one of the first parts of the
    new and more monumental decoration. After that the half-dome
    was painted, judging from the drops of paint that have fallen
    down and that were found under the painting in between.</p>
         <head xml:id="HV5N2InnemeeVanRompay3">1.2. Pisentios and Apakir (Fig. 2).</head>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P5"/>[5] On the
    left part of the northern wall saints Pisentios and Apakir are
    represented. Their identity can be established by the
    inscriptions on either side of their heads and by their
    attributes.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Fig. 2. Pisentios and Apakir, northern wall
    of the <hi rend="italic">khurus</hi>, layer 2.<lb/>
         </p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P6"/>[6] The left
    saint is dressed as a bishop, wearing an omophorion with both
    ends in front. The inscription on either side of his head is
    still well legible. ABB[...]ICENTI is written left of his head,
    right of his head  TCINTI. This must be St. Pisentios,
    whose name is followed by his <hi rend="italic">epitheton ornans</hi> (TCINTI
    means "the foundation"; it also is the name of the community
    close to Deir al-Bahari, where he lived). He was born around
    568 and consecrated as bishop of Koptos in 598.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P7"/>[7] Left of
    the other saint there is the inscription <hi rend="gr">O
    AGIO</hi>C, right the letters <hi rend="gr">APAK[..]</hi>. He carries the attributes of a doctor, a
    medicine box and a scalpel, similar to those of Cosmas and
    Damian on the opposite side of the church. This must be St.
    Apakir, a martyr from the time of Diocletian who had a
    reputation as a doctor.</p>
         <head xml:id="HV5N2InnemeeVanRompay4">1.3. "Damianos" (Fig. 3).</head>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P8"/>[8] In the
    middle of the northern wall there is painting representing a
    standing bishop or patriarch. He has a youthful face with a
    short dark beard. He is dressed in full episcopal garments and
    holds a book in front of him with both hands. A red cloth is
    draped over his hands. On either sides of the person there are
    representations of architecture. On the left a tower-like
    structure that may be a church; a ladder is standing against
    it, giving access to the first floor. On the right there is a
    walled building with a gate. It is not yet clear what the
    nature and the meaning of these buildings are. The
    identification of the person poses some problems, too. Next to
    his head there is the barely legible inscription O
    A<hi rend="gr">G</hi>IOC  [......]ANOC. The way he
    holds the book in front of him, a red cloth on his hands,
    reminds of the icon of St. Mark (6<hi rend="sup">th</hi>-7<hi rend="sup">th</hi>
    cent.), now in the Bibliothèque Nationale in Paris
    [Grabar 1980, fig 186]. Judging from his dress, which is more
    elaborate than that of a normal bishop, and from his youthful
    appearance, he may be Damianos, 35<hi rend="sup">th</hi>  patriarch
    of Alexandria (578-605), who was consecrated at a rather young
    age [Evetts 1904, 473-478]. There may also be a connection with
    the painting of St. Pisentios, who was consecrated by Damianos.
    Furthermore we know that Damianos was a monk in Wadi al-Natrun
    before becoming a patriarch. He was of Syrian origin, but
    considering the likelihood that this painting was done prior to
    the arrival of the first Syrian monks, this should most
    probably not be counted as a reason to depict him here.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Fig. 3. Patriarch (Damianos?), northern wall
    of the <hi rend="italic">khurus</hi>, layer 2.<lb/>
         </p>
         <head xml:id="HV5N2InnemeeVanRompay5">1.4. Luke and Barnabas (Fig. 4).</head>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P9"/>[9] The
    panel to the right has the representations of St. Luke and St.
    Barnabas. To the left is St. Luke, identified by the
    inscription <hi rend="gr">O AGI[..] LOU</hi>KAC. Next to
    him is Barnabas with the inscription O A<hi rend="gr">G</hi>IOC [....]ABAC. In contrast to the other
    paintings, the figures are represented in a framework of two
    arches, separated by a column. Also in other respects this
    painting is different from the others on the northern wall: the
    painting has been done on a black background with a thick layer
    of encaustic paint, while the others have a thinner layer of
    paint on a white ground. The arches, the deep red of the dress
    of  St. Luke, and the triple dots as an ornament on it
    have a very close parallel in the paintings in the
    <hi rend="italic">haikal</hi> of Benjamin in the neighbouring monastery of
    St. Macarius, especially in the painting of St. John the
    Baptist [Leroy 1982, pl. 5]. The similarity is so striking that
    it might be presumed that both paintings have been done by the
    same artist. The so-called church of patriarch Benjamin was
    consecrated by Benjamin himself in 655, but there is no
    certainty concerning the date of the paintings. Leroy is not
    explicit on this issue. A closer investigation of the paintings
    and their stratigraphical context in the monastery of St.
    Macarius would, therefore, probably be useful for a more
    precise dating of the paintings in Deir al-Surian.</p>

         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P10"/>[10] On
    the attached half-column on the western wall of the northern
    <hi rend="italic">khurus</hi> a painting has been uncovered that seems to be
    a counterpart to the standing monk on the column in the
    southern <hi rend="italic">khurus</hi>. It shows a standing monk in a red
    tunic and a light-blue cloak.  Although the painting is
    heavily damaged it is clear that the characteristics of his
    costume are those of Upper Egypt. On his shoulders he wears a
    black hood that has been drawn back. In his right hand he holds
    a staff diagonally in front of him. Below his waist there is a
    diagonal line that may be the remainder of a <hi rend="italic">rahtou,</hi>
    the leather apron of Pachomian monks. At the left side of his
    head there is the inscription ABB[.] ΑΠOΛO, at
    the other side a remarkably large star has been painted on the
    blue of the background. The meaning of this detail is unclear
    so far. It should be a representation of Apollo, the father who
    founded the monastery in Bawit at the end of the fourth
    century. He is clearly meant as a counterpart for the painting
    of the monk on the other side of the <hi rend="italic">khurus</hi>, who is
    not identified by any inscription, but who is dressed in the
    Lower Egyptian costume.</p>

         <head xml:id="HV5N2InnemeeVanRompay7">1.6. The northern half-dome.</head>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P11"/>[11] The
    13<hi rend="sup">th</hi> century painting of the Dormition of the Virgin
    (layer 4) in the northern half-dome is in a critical condition.
    In many places the painted plaster has detached itself from the
    underlying surface, an earlier painting belonging to layer 2.
    This earlier painting is also in a bad condition, due to the
    fact that the masonry of the half-dome has deep cracks. In the
    near future these two layers will have to be separated in order
    to save as much of them as possible. In the past season
    provisional measures have been taken to avoid further
    deterioration. During this work parts of the lower edge of the
    older painting became visible. On the right side a pair of feet
    and three sheep appeared, on the left an inscription reading
    MELXIOP. This can hardly mean anything else than that the
    painting depicts the Nativity. This is a confirmation of the
    hypothesis that the Annunciation, discovered in 1991 in the
    western half-dome, is the first scene of a christological cycle
    [Innemée 1995]. Reading these scenes clockwise, one
    would expect a painting of the Ascension in the east, the place
    where we find now the domed square sanctuary, constructed in
    the time of Moses of Nisibis.  There are, however reasons
    to believe that originally the church had an apse, similar in
    construction to the northern and western endings of the
    <hi rend="italic">khurus</hi>. This would have been a most suitable place for
    an Ascension in an early Coptic church (compare the first layer
    in the tri-conch sanctuary of the Red Monastery in Sohag). At
    the same time it is the before-last theme in the classical
    early-Christian christological cycles. That would leave the
    theme of Pentecost for the last half-dome, the one in the
    southern <hi rend="italic">khurus</hi>. This half-dome now shows the
    Annunciation and the Nativity, the beginning of the
    13<hi rend="sup">th</hi>-century cycle. This cycle originally had the
    Ascension in the western half-dome as its third scene and ended
    with the Dormition of the Virgin in the northern half-dome.</p>
         <head xml:id="HV5N2InnemeeVanRompay8">2. Paintings on layer 3.</head>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P12"/>[12]
    Layer 3 was first encountered in 1999, when the upper walls of
    the <hi rend="italic">khurus</hi> were investigated. This layer does not
    cover the entire surface of the interior of the church, but
    only the square zone under the dome over the <hi rend="italic">khurus.</hi>
    So far these paintings have been dated to the beginning of the
    10<hi rend="sup">th</hi> century. This is partially based on the Coptic
    inscription running around the dome. In this text, not yet
    completely uncovered, a certain Moses, who is called
    <hi rend="italic">hegoumenos</hi> and <hi rend="italic">oikonomos,</hi> is mentioned,
    possibly as one of the commissioners of the paintings, and it
    is not to be excluded that he is to be identified with Moses of
    Nisibis.</p>

         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P13"/>[13]
    After removal of 18<hi rend="sup">th</hi>-century plaster from the upper
    eastern wall a row of three blocked windows appeared,
    corresponding to the windows in the southern and northern wall.
    Between these windows two paintings were uncovered, belonging
    to layer 3.  Because of the bad state of preservation the
    identification was uncertain initially, but after the discovery
    of Syriac inscriptions underneath this problem could be
    solved.<ref target="#FN2">2</ref> The right painting shows the remains of a person
    on horseback. The horse is black with a pattern of white spots
    or decorative shaving. Of the rider almost nothing is left. The
    upper part of the frame shows an overlapping fragment of a
    lance, from which we can deduce that the rider is a warrior. In
    the sky over the head of the rider there is a half-circle with
    stars and a decorated cross inside, from which rays are
    radiating (Fig. 7). The Syriac text underneath reads: "The
    king, when he saw the sign [of] the cross [in h]eaven, believed
    in Ch[rist]" (see text 1.1 in the second part of this report).
    This is a clear allusion to the vision of Constantine.</p>

            <anchor corresp="P14"/>[14] The
    space between the middle and the left windows was filled with a
    painting of which only a fragment of a figure holding a piece
    of cloth is left. On this piece of cloth a part of a haloed
    head is visible. These iconographical indications point already
    in the direction of Abgar, and the inscription under the
    painting confirm this. It reads: "...and he sent him the image"
    (see § 1.2 in the second part of this report).</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Fig. 8. Abgar of Edessa, holding the

         </p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P15"/>[15] The
    paintings of Abgar and Constantine clearly fit into an
    iconographical context. On the southern wall the conversion of
    the chamberlain of the Candace by St. Philip and St. Andrew
    converting and baptising the dog-headed cannibals are
    represented [Innemée 1998]. On the northern wall an
    inscription indicates that Gregory the Illuminator had been
    represented here. In other words, the paintings in this part of
    the church have as a common theme the conversion of the foreign
    peoples. Abgar and Constantine take prominent places on the
    eastern wall as the first Syrian king and the first Roman
    emperor to embrace Christianity. It can also be seen as a
    Syrian statement, showing Abgar at an equal level with
    Constantine.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P16"/>[16] The
    dating of these paintings is an interesting, but not yet
    completely solved question. As mentioned above, the text around
    the dome, associated with the “conversion
    paintings” could point toMoses of Nisibis. The two other
    persons mentioned in the text are a certain Ahron and a deacon
    Johannes. So far these two persons have not yet been further
    identified. The paintings of Abgar and Constantine on the upper
    eastern wall have been carefully made between the three windows
    that were blocked when the dome over the <hi rend="italic">haikal</hi> was
    constructed. This suggests that the windows were still open
    when the paintings were made and that the paintings, therefore,
    antedate the rebuilding of the <hi rend="italic">haikal</hi>. The next
    question then is when the rebuilding took place. So far it was
    commonly assumed that the construction of the <hi rend="italic">haikal</hi>
    doors in 913/14 (Evelyn White 1932, 337) was directly linked to
    the rebuilding of the <hi rend="italic">haikal</hi>. However, investigation
    into the plaster behind these doors and the stucco of the
    doorjambs, in June 2002, has shown no direct evidence for
    linking the construction of these doors to the rebuilding of
    the <hi rend="italic">haikal</hi>. The date of 913/14 should not be used,
    therefore, as the <hi rend="italic">terminus ad quem</hi>, neither for the
    <hi rend="italic">haikal</hi> in its present shape (which may be of a later
    date), nor for the “conversion paintings”. The
    first known representation so far of Abgar is the icon in St.
    Catherine's monastery, dated after 945, the year that the
    <hi rend="italic">mandylion</hi> was transferred to Constantinople [Weitzmann
    1960]. The fact that this painting of Abgar was apparently made
    at the order of Syrian monks, suggests that at that time the
    <hi rend="italic">mandylion</hi> was still in Syrian hands. Although these
    are mere indications and no hard proofs, a dating to the
    beginning of the 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi> century seems tempting.</p>

            <anchor corresp="P17"/>[17] Just
    under the level of the paintings of Abgar and Constantine there
    are important remains of a sequence of paintings representing
    the events surrounding the death of the Virgin Mary. This
    series of representations must have been painted later, though
    probably not much later. This can be deduced from the slight
    overlap of these paintings with the higher paintings of
    Constantine and Abgar. The thin layer of plaster that was
    applied for these paintings was still clean enough to add the
    Dormition sequence, but it had already some cracks. This
    suggests an interval of a few decades at most between both sets
    of paintings. Although they were made in a period that the
    population of the monastery had a significant Syrian component,
    we find only Coptic inscriptions accompanying the several
    scenes.</p>

         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P18"/>[18] At
    the far left there is a representation of the Dormition. The
    Virgin lies on a bed, surrounded by the twelve apostles, who
    are seated in two rows on either side of the bed. They are not
    individually identified, but both groups of six have the
    explanatory text NI A<hi rend="gr">P</hi>OCTO<hi rend="gr">L</hi>O[.]. Apart from these persons there are six
    women, three on either side, who are swinging censers. This is
    a rather remarkable detail, since the handling of censers is
    traditionally a male activity in the orthodox churches. The
    Coptic inscription in the painting calls the six women NI
    <hi rend="gr">P</hi>AP<hi rend="gr">Q</hi>EN[..],
    “virgins”, without any specific names. Behind the
    bed a large winged figure stands, most probably to be
    identified as the archangel Michael, who is by tradition the
    <hi rend="italic">psychopompos</hi>, the one accompanying the souls of the
    dead to the hereafter. The only remains of his name are the
    letters […..]H<hi rend="gr">L</hi>. He is standing,
    his hands stretched out in a gesture as if he is expecting to
    receive the soul of the Virgin. Also this detail is unusual; in
    all known representations of the subject Christ is taking this
    position.</p>

         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P19"/>[19] To
    the right there has been a scene that is now almost completely
    missing. The only part that survives of the representation is a
    group of men at the far right, looking up with expressions of
    amazement. At the top of the edge there is fragment of a Coptic
    inscription reading: <hi rend="gr">P</hi>C<hi style="font-size:140%;font-family:Symbol">w</hi>MA NTI, "the body
    of ...". This is a strong indication that the now missing scene
    represented the assumption of the body of the Virgin.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P20"/>[20] The
    oldest representations of the Dormition are post-iconoclastic,
    the earliest dated examples are from the 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi>
    century [Myslivec 1972].</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P21"/>[21] The
    centre of the sequence is taken by a representation of Christ
    and the Virgin, sitting side by side on a throne. He holds her
    left hand by the wrist and raises it as if in a gesture of
    triumph. At the left side of the head of the Virgin there is a
    representation of the sun, while the moon can be seen right of
    the head of Christ. This scene can be understood as a
    representation of the reunification of the body and soul of the
    Virgin in heaven and of her reception by Christ. Also this
    representation is quite exceptional. There seems to be no
    direct parallel known for it so far. A throne shared by two or
    more deities or emperors is known from earlier periods. A
    late-antique example of such a representation, where also sun
    and moon are flanking the throne, is the miniature from the
    Vergilius Vaticanus, showing Jupiter and other deities on a
    throne [Grabar 1980, fig. 210].</p>

         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P22"/>[22] The
    paintings in the dome over the <hi rend="italic">khurus</hi> are in a very
    bad state of preservation. Very few fragments have been
    uncovered so far. The only fragment that could be identified
    shows a part of a winged figure, holding a staff in the
    direction of flames. The most likely identification for this
    fragment is the episode from the Book of Daniel of the three
    men in the fiery furnace. Further to the right there is a
    fragment of what seems to be the leg of a throne. This might be
    the throne of king Nebuchadnezzar. If this is the case and if
    there would indeed have been a sequence from the book of Daniel
    in the dome, this would also be a quite unusual phenomenon. Old
    Testament scenes in the eastern part of the church with a
    typological meaning, especially in relationship to the
    Eucharist, are quite common in Egypt, but in a dome one would
    rather expect a New Testament subject.</p>

         <head xml:id="HV5N2InnemeeVanRompay12">3. Layer 4: Rearrangement of the iconographical
    themes?</head>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P23"/>[23] So
    far we have little evidence from layer 4 of the paintings,
    apart from the three half-domes that have never been plastered
    over. This is mostly due to the fact that before replastering
    the walls at the end of the 18<hi rend="sup">th</hi> century, most of
    the loose plaster from previous centuries was removed. At that
    moment the 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi> century paintings of layer 4 were
    the top layer and therefore the most vulnerable. But in spite
    of the relatively small number of remains of the most recent
    layer of paintings, we get the impression that there must have
    been a certain system in the redecoration of the interior. The
    cycle of Annunciation, Nativity, Ascension (and Pentecost?) was
    at least partially repeated in the three remaining half-domes.
    The Dormition was chosen as the last theme, originally an
    addition on layer 3, but now given the monumental size of a
    painting in one of the half-domes. This must have been a
    deliberate choice to underline the position of the Virgin as
    the saint to whom the church is dedicated. Mounted saints,
    painted on layer 2 in the <hi rend="italic">khurus</hi>, have been repeated
    on the walls of the southern aisle. The story of the Three
    Hebrews in the furnace, painted in the dome on layer 3,
    returned in a somewhat more modest position on the same wall in
    the southern aisle, be it in an equally monumental size.
    Unfortunately we have almost no traces of paintings from layer
    4 in the <hi rend="italic">khurus,</hi> but future discoveries in the nave
    might shed more light on the iconographical programme of layer
    4.</p>

         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P24"/>[24] As
    mentioned above, a number of walled-up windows were found. Two
    windows were found in the northern wall of the <hi rend="italic">khurus</hi>,
    corresponding to similar windows in the southern wall. As in
    the case of the southern wall, there is no evidence that these
    windows were blocked from the inside before the 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi>
    century. They had lost their function already when the chapel
    of the forty-nine martyrs was built, probably in the
    10<hi rend="sup">th</hi> century.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P25"/>[25]
    Similarly, on the upper eastern wall three blocked windows were
    found, corresponding to the windows on the northern and
    southern wall. These windows lost their function after the
    remodelling of the <hi rend="italic">haikal</hi>, but it was not until the
    13<hi rend="sup">th</hi> century that they were finally walled up and
    plastered over.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P26"/>[26] On
    ground-floor level, developments in the shape of the doorway
    leading into the northern <hi rend="italic">haikal</hi> could be studied
    after the removal of 18<hi rend="sup">th</hi> century plaster from the
    wall in the north-eastern corner of the <hi rend="italic">khurus</hi>.
    Originally, in the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi>-century situation, there has
    been a rectangular doorway leading into the northern room,
    which must have had a <hi rend="italic">pastoforion</hi> at that time. The
    position of this door was moved to the centre and the shape of
    the doorway was changed into an arched entrance of about 1.50
    m. wide. At the inside this arch was lined with decorative
    polychromed woodwork.  Judging from the plaster and
    painting around this door, its reshaping must have been done
    before the paintings of layer 2 were made.</p>

    Recent work in the Church of the Virgin by the team of
    art-historians and conservators under the direction of Karel
    Innemée has produced a number of new Syriac texts. A
    brief survey of the texts, diverse in nature and in time of
    origin, will be given here. First, I will discuss the texts
    that have come to light on the eastern wall of the
    <hi rend="italic">khurus</hi> (1). This will be followed by some notes on the
    graffiti found near the entrance to the <hi rend="italic">haikal</hi> (2) and
    finally I will describe a piece of parchment that was found in
    one of the walls (3).</p>
         <head xml:id="HV5N2InnemeeVanRompay14">1. Inscriptions on the eastern wall of the
    <hi rend="italic">khurus</hi>.</head>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P28"/>[28] The
    texts uncovered in this part of the church are not the remains
    of independent inscriptions, of the type of which several have
    been found in the past years in the nave. The new texts rather
    accompany the wall paintings, for which they serve as
    explanation and commentary. Along with the paintings, they
    probably were painted with a brush.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P29"/>[29] The
    very imperfectly preserved paintings belong to the upper zone
    of painting on the eastern wall. The themes that are
    represented here have been identified by Karel Innemée
    as the conversion of Constantine (right) and the conversion of
    Abgar (left). These identifications are partly based on the
    evidence of the texts [see Karel Innemée, above, 2.1].
    Text and representation should indeed be studied together.</p>

         </quote>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P31"/>[31] The
    text is carefully written in a beautiful <hi rend="italic">estrangelo</hi> and
    even includes two diacritical points, one on top of the first
    word (“king”), the second below the first letter of
    the verbal form (“he saw”), marking the form as a
    third person perfect. The writing direction is horizontal, from
    right to left. Figures 1 and 2 show the initial and final part
    of the text respectively; a tiny portion in the middle cannot
    be seen on the photographs.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P32"/>[32]
    Preceding the first word, part of a letter or a decoration in
    the shape of a circle can be seen. If it is a letter, it can be
    <hi rend="italic">semkat</hi> (the end of Constantine’s name?) or
    alternatively <hi rend="italic">waw</hi> or <hi rend="italic">hê</hi>.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P33"/>[33] Due
    to damage, the text is incomplete in four places (indicated by
    square brackets in the above transcription).  In the first
    two places, only one letter is missing. The third lacuna is
    slightly larger. I propose the reading:
    [<hi rend="italic">ba-š</hi>]<hi rend="italic">mayyo</hi>, [in h]eaven”. The
    reading [<hi rend="italic">men š</hi>]<hi rend="italic">mayyo</hi>, “[from
    h]eaven” would also be possible. Before the last lacuna,
    parts of what is probably a <hi rend="italic">shin</hi> can be seen. This seems
    to point to the reading <hi rend="italic">ba-Mši<!--<u>-->h<!--</u>-->o</hi> “in
    Christ”.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P34"/>[34] In
    the above translation, the <hi rend="italic">waw</hi> preceding the second
    verbal form is interpreted as a <hi rend="italic">waw</hi> of the apodosis and
    therefore left untranslated. If the preserved text were part of
    a longer sentence (a possibility that cannot be ruled out), a
    different interpretation might impose itself</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P35"/>[35]
    Among the main characteristics of the writing style are the
    closed form of the first <hi rend="italic">mim</hi> (the two other occurrences
    of <hi rend="italic">mim</hi> are less clear), the thick ending (or
    “shoe”) of the lower right-hand stroke of the
    non-connected <hi rend="italic">olaf</hi>, and the rather large
    <hi rend="italic">hê</hi>. In general, the writing style is close to what
    is found in tenth and early-eleventh century manuscripts, e.g.,
    Hatch, Plates 72 (928/929), 73 (935/936), 76 (994), and 78
    (1007). The somewhat reclining position of <hi rend="italic">olaf</hi> and
    <hi rend="italic">taw</hi> might betray the scribe’s natural preference
    for a vertical rather than a horizontal writing direction.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P36"/>[36] The
    Syriac sentence most likely refers to the emperor Constantine.
    It summarizes the dramatic event that took place during the
    battle of the Milvian bridge, when a cross appeared to the
    emperor and brought about his conversion. The main report of
    Constantine’s conversion is found in Eusebius of
    Caesarea’s <hi rend="italic">Life of Constantine</hi>, which probably
    once existed in Syriac, even though it has not been preserved
    [Baumstark 1922, 59]. A summary of the conversion narrative is
    included in the so-called <hi rend="italic">Chronicle to the year 1234</hi>,
    which is based on much earlier sources. Here the wording is
    very similar to that of the new inscription: <hi rend="italic">…
    ’oto d-(’)et<!--<u>-->h<!--</u>-->azyat ba-šmayyo ba-dmut
    <!--<u>-->s<!--</u>-->libo</hi>, “… the sign which appeared in
    heaven in the likeness of the cross”  [Chabot 1920,
    139, line 14, see also line 17 – translation in Chabot
    1937, 110-111]. This similarity is further evidence that the
    isolated Syriac sentence should indeed be interpreted as
    referring to Constantine’s conversion.</p>

    again, the text is painted in black against a reddish
    background, from right to left. The following words can be

            <p>
               <graphic url="HV5N2VanRompayTxt02.gif" rend="img" mimeType="image/gif" width="114px" height="15px"/>
            </p>
            <p>“And he sent him the image.”</p>
         </quote>
         <p>Rather than completing the text with a final <hi rend="italic">olaf</hi>,
    one might also think of <hi rend="italic">hê</hi>, which would be a
    possessive suffix: “his image”.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P38"/>[38] This
    <hi rend="italic">estrangelo</hi> text is written less carefully than the
    preceding one and most likely by a different hand. The
    <hi rend="italic">dolat</hi> and <hi rend="italic">rish</hi> as well as the open <hi rend="italic">waw</hi> may
    perhaps point to a tenth-century date. Compare, e.g., Hatch,
    Plates 72 (928/929) and 76 (994). With so little evidence,
    however, it is very difficult to assign a date with any degree
    of confidence.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P39"/>[39] The
    most likely interpretation of the three Syriac words seems to
    be that Jesus sent the/his image to Abgar, the king of Edessa.
    However, this interpretation and the terms that are used do not
    match the earliest Syriac form of the Abgar story, as found in
    the <hi rend="italic">Teaching of Addai</hi>. Here it is Hanan, the royal
    painter, who on his own initiative produced the image and
    brought it to Abgar. There is no question of Jesus’
    sending it to Abgar. Moreover, the term used is
    <hi rend="italic"><!--<u>-->s<!--</u>-->almo</hi>, rather than <hi rend="italic">yuqno</hi> (based on the
    Greek <hi rend="italic">eikôn</hi>), the word used in the new
    inscription.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P40"/>[40] It
    should be noted that from the seventh or eighth century onwards
    the story of Christ’s image assumed a new shape and a new
    prominence in Syriac Christianity. Christ’s portrait now
    became a miraculous image and started playing a more important
    role in the narrative of the conversion to Christianity of
    Abgar and the Edessene population. Hanan’s role was
    downplayed and Christ became the sole protagonist, who
    miraculously produced the image and sent it to Abgar. In this
    new phase in the life of the story, the term <hi rend="italic">yuqno</hi> was
    used and replaced the earlier <hi rend="italic"><!--<u>-->s<!--</u>-->almo</hi>. The earliest
    clear evidence for the story in its new form may be found in
    the Chronicle of Dionysius of Tel-Mahrê (d. 845), or
    perhaps in the work of Theophilus of Edessa (d. 785), one of
    Dionysius’s sources for this part of his Chronicle. A few
    decades earlier, probably between 720 and 737, similar language
    of Christ’s sending his <hi rend="italic">yuqno</hi> to Abgar was used in
    a dispute between an East-Syrian monk and a Muslim [cf.
    Drijvers 1998, 23 and 27, with further references]. Whatever
    the precise date of this new development may be, it is this
    later form of the Abgar story that is reflected in our Syriac
    inscription.</p>

    During the work carried out on the east wall of the
    <hi rend="italic">khurus</hi>, remains of inscriptions were found on the
    half-column left of the entrance to the <hi rend="italic">haikal</hi>. We seem
    to be dealing with graffiti-like inscriptions left by visitors.
    Similar texts can be found at several other places in the
    church [Van Rompay 1999, 41-43]. They often contain the name of
    the writer, a reference to his sinful condition, and a
    supplication for mercy or a request to the reader to pray on
    his behalf. Although on the column there are traces of several
    inscriptions, three of them, providing a couple of words,
    deserve to be singled out. They are all written in black; the
    writing direction is vertical, from top to bottom. They are at
    a height of ca. 1.40 m. It is very difficult to assign a date
    to graffiti, which often are written in an informal style. The
    <hi rend="italic">estrangelo</hi> text (2.3) might possibly date back to the
    tenth or eleventh century.</p>

            <anchor corresp="P45"/>[45]
    During conservation work in the northern part of the
    <hi rend="italic">khurus</hi>, a few pieces of parchment were found in the
    wall. The exact location was an earlier window in the northern
    wall, which after the building of the adjacent chapel of the
    forty-nine martyrs had lost its function. It had, therefore,
    been sealed up and covered with plaster, probably in the
    thirteenth century (see the first part of this report, under
    4). In this process, shards of pottery and other rubble were
    deposited in the empty space. The fragments were among these
    materials.</p>

         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P46"/>[46] The
    smaller pieces of parchment have hardly any traces of writing
    and do not lend themselves to further study. A larger fragment,
    measuring on its longest side 11 x 11 cm, is more interesting.
    It is inscribed on both sides and the text can be identified as
    belonging to the end of the first chapter of the Gospel of
    John. This identification also allows us to distinguish between
    the recto and verso sides. We may be dealing with a fragment of
    a manuscript that contained the four Gospels in the Peshitta
    version. Except for the orthography of the name
    “Israel” in John 1:47, the text is identical to the
    main text of Gwilliam’s edition [Gwilliam 1901]. In the
    following transcription, the missing parts are added from
    Gwilliam’s edition and placed between square
    brackets.</p>

         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P47"/>[47] On
    the verso side, the ink has become extremely faint and very
    little can be read. If my identification of the second section
    is correct, we must assume that the first section of text is
    from the upper part of the recto side and the second section
    from the upper part of the verso side. Around fifty words are
    missing between the end of the first and the beginning of the
    second section. These may have filled ten, eleven, or twelve
    lines.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P48"/>[48]
    Although we cannot completely rule out the possibility that the
    manuscript originally was in two columns (the first section
    belonging to the left-hand column of the recto side and the
    second section belonging to the right-hand column of the verso
    side), it is much more likely that we are dealing with a small
    manuscript written in one column.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P49"/>[49] As a
    matter of fact, a close parallel for this layout can be found
    in ms. British Library, Add. 17,116, containing the Gospels of
    Mathew and Mark and dated by Wright to the sixth century
    [Wright I, 65a]. It measures 22.25 x 14 cm and has 18 to 26
    lines on each page. There is an average of 80 words on a page,
    exactly the number which once was on the page from which our
    fragment comes. The same layout is found, e.g., in ms. British
    Library, Add. 14,429, containing the Books of Samuel and Kings
    in the version of Jacob of Edessa [Wright I, 37b-39a and a
    facsimile in Wright III, Pl. VII]. For this manuscript, datable
    to the early eighth century, the dimensions are 26.5 x 16.25 cm
    and there are between 19 and 23 lines on each page. Here again,
    the number of words on a page is around 80.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P50"/>[50] Our
    manuscript originally may have measured between 28 and 30 cm x
    ca. 18 cm. The very regular and elegant <hi rend="italic">estrangelo</hi> has
    its closest parallel in the above-mentioned manuscript British
    Library, Add. 14,429 (ca. 719) and in other manuscripts of the
    late seventh and eighth centuries, e.g., Hatch, Plate 52
    (736:  the four Gospels, in two columns, 17/18 lines in
    each column). A date in the seventh or eighth century is,
    therefore, plausible.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P51"/>[51] The
    above observations are of a very provisional nature. They are
    based mainly on photographs taken by Karel Innemée and
    on personal comments made by him. A brief visit to Deir
    al-Surian in February 2002 has given me insight into the
    locations of the various Syriac texts, but since the scaffolds
    were no longer in place, I was unable to examine the two major
    texts (1.1 and 1.2) <hi rend="italic">in situ</hi>. Much study and research
    will be needed to place the various pieces of evidence, which
    are like numerous pieces of a jigsaw puzzle, into their proper
    context and to rewrite the cultural and artistic history of
    this fascinating monastery. Meanwhile, the art historians and
    conservators of Karel Innemée’s team should be
    congratulated on their splendid work!</p>_______<lb/>

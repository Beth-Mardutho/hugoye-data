         <div type="abstract">
            <p>Inspired by and in response to Stephen J.
    Davis' recent book on The Cult of St Thecla (2001), this paper
    is a first exploration of the evidence on Thecla in Syriac
    Christianity. The relatively extensive Syriac manuscript
    tradition of the Acts of Paul and Thecla is briefly surveyed
    and placed within its wider literary and cultural contexts. A
    few suggestions are made concerning the reception of the text
    and the popularity of the Thecla cult. The paper should be read
    in conjunction with <ref target="HV5N2PRHarvey.html">Susan Ashbrook
    Harvey's review of Davis' book</ref>, published elsewhere in this

         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P1"/>[1] In
    Davis' recent book on the cult of Thecla, an impressive wealth
    of material is adduced to illustrate the different ways in
    which the Apocryphal <hi rend="italic">Acts of Paul and Thecla</hi> were read
    and interpreted in Egypt [Davis 2001]. Early papyrus fragments
    of the <hi rend="italic">Acts</hi> in Greek and Coptic, references in
    literary texts, wall paintings and material remains attest to
    the popularity of Thecla's story as well as to the spread of
    her cult.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P2"/>[2] In
    addition to the original and extensive treatment of the
    Egyptian material, Davis provides an excellent survey of the
    literary developments and the cult surrounding the Thecla
    shrine in Seleucia, Asia Minor. Other areas of the Christian
    East, however, are only occasionally discussed.  For
    example, Davis refers to Syriac evidence in a number of
    footnotes, indicating its potential importance, but undertakes
    no exhaustive study of the Syrian Thecla cult, choosing to
    limit his analysis to Egypt. Admittedly, works of art or
    material objects related to Thecla are almost non-existent in
    Syria. But the Syriac field has preserved some very ancient and
    nearly complete manuscript witnesses of the <hi rend="italic">Acts</hi>,
    which prove that the Thecla story was read and enjoyed
    considerable popularity among Syrian Christians. It is our aim
    here to present some preliminary data that may contribute to a
    future comprehensive study of the cult of Thecla in Syriac
    Christianity.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P3"/>[3] Let us
    begin with a brief discussion of the Syriac manuscripts
    containing the <hi rend="italic">Acts of Paul and Thecla</hi>. William
    Wright's 1871 edition and translation of the text are based on
    four manuscripts [Wright 1871, 127-169 (Syriac text); 116-145
    (English translation) xii-xiii (Preface)]. All four manuscripts
    were kept in the library of the Egyptian Monastery of the
    Syrians until their transfer to the British Museum in London
    around the middle of the nineteenth century [Innemée
    &amp; Van Rompay 1998; Van Rompay &amp; Schmidt 2001].</p>

         </list>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P4"/>[4] In 1902,
    Anton Baumstark observed that these manuscripts belong to two
    different categories [Baumstark 1902, 31]. In the first two
    manuscripts, the Thecla texts (entitled "History of Thecla, the
    disciple of Paul the apostle" and "History of Thecla, the
    martyr") belong to a larger literary unit that is called "Book
    of women" (<hi rend="italic">Ktâbâ
    d-neššê</hi>). This consists of five books
    in the sixth-century manuscript (the Book of Ruth, the Book of
    Esther, the Book of Susanna, the Book of Judith, and the
    History of Thecla) and of four books in the tenth-century
    manuscript (On the chaste Susanna, the Exploits of Esther, the
    History of Judith, and the History of Thecla). In the latter
    two manuscripts, the Thecla texts (respectively entitled
    "History of the illustrious Thecla, the one of Paul" and
    "History concerning Thecla, who was the betrothed of Thamyris,
    the king's son, and at the end (was) the disciple of Paul the
    apostle") are part of large collections of historical,
    hagiographical, and martyrological texts. In the fourth
    manuscript we are dealing with an impressive collection of
    seventy-eight pieces.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P5"/>[5] The
    colophons of these four manuscripts allow us to make a few
    observations on the places in which the manuscripts originated
    or were originally kept. Although the sixth-century manuscript
    (no. 1 of the above list) cannot be located geographically, a
    largely effaced colophon contains the name of an abbess Maryam,
    who seems to have been the owner of the book [Wright II, 1872,
    652a], prior to its transfer to the Egyptian monastery. This
    may be seen as evidence that the Syriac Thecla text was read by
    women, as Davis has argued was the case in Egypt. The second
    manuscript has only an owner's note of the Monastery of the
    Syrians. The other two manuscripts (nos. 3 and 4) belong to a
    period in Syriac literature that was characterized by the aim
    to collect and preserve the literary productions of the earlier
    generations of Syriac Christianity. In the third manuscript
    there is no colophon or note. The fourth manuscript originated
    in the Monastery of Barsauma at Melitene in 1197 and has a note
    written on behalf of Michael, the patriarch of the
    Syrian-Orthodox Church [Wright III, 1872, 1137a-1139a], one of
    the protagonists in what has been called the "Syriac
    Renaissance".</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P6"/>[6] Without
    having undertaken an exhaustive survey of the catalogues, we
    would like to point out the existence of several additional
    manuscripts. Some of them have already received scholarly
    attention; others have remained unnoticed so far. In the first
    place, two manuscripts should be mentioned which have come to
    light through the work of the Peshitta Institute in Leiden. In
    the course of a trip undertaken in search of Syriac biblical
    manuscripts in 1964-1965, professor P.A.H. de Boer saw them in
    the Monastery of the Syrians in Egypt and was given permission
    to photograph them. Their content has not yet been fully
    explored and it will suffice here to point out briefly their
    potential importance for further research. These new
    manuscripts (nos. 5 and 6) also belong to the same Monastery of
    the Syrians mentioned above, which, therefore, in its heyday
    must have had (at least) six copies of the Thecla text in its
    library [Murad Kamil <hi rend="italic">s.d.</hi>; Peshitta Institute
    1968].</p>
         <list type="ordered">
            <item>Ms. Deir al-Surian 28, sixth century [Murad Kamil,
      XXVIII]</item>
         </list>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P7"/>[7] We are
    dealing with a composite manuscript. The first part (f. 2-63)
    contains the complete Book of Job. A note at the end reports
    that in the month <hi rend="italic">Kânun qdem</hi> of the year 910 (=
    AD 598, December) the manuscript was purchased by the lady
    Thom(a)ta bat Sargis for the church of <hi rend="italic">Igâ</hi> or
    <hi rend="italic">Aygâ</hi>, a place which we have been unable to
    identify. This (part of the) manuscript was classified as 6h20
    in the classification system of the Leiden Peshitta Institute.
    It was used in the Leiden edition of Job [Rignell 1993, esp.
    VIII-IX].</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P8"/>[8] The
    second part of the manuscript (f. 64-132), written by a
    different, probably also sixth-century hand, contains the Book
    of Daniel (including Bel and Draco) and the Book of Thecla. The
    exact date and the place of origin of this manuscript are
    unknown. An owners' note at the beginning of this part of the
    manuscript mentions the names of "Mattay, Abraham, and
    Theodore". These are the Takritan brothers, who must have
    brought the manuscript to Egypt somewhere between c. 820 and c.
    850 [Van Rompay &amp; Schmidt 2001, 45-46]. The place of this
    note indicates that when the brothers acquired this manuscript,
    it was not yet bound together with the Job manuscript. This
    must have been done, therefore, at a later moment in the
    Monastery of the Syrians. This (part of the) manuscript was
    classified as 6h21 in the classification system of the Leiden
    Peshitta Institute. It was used in the Leiden edition of Daniel
    [Sprey 1980, esp. V-VI].</p>
         <list type="ordered">
            <item>Ms. Deir al-Surian 27, eighth century [Murad Kamil,
      XXVII]</item>
         </list>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P9"/>[9] Like the
    preceding one, this too is a composite manuscript. The first
    part (f. 3-51), which is incomplete at the beginning and at the
    end, can be dated to the eighth century. It contains Flavius
    Josephus' account of the destruction of Jerusalem, taken from
    "The Jewish War", III Maccabees, Ruth, Susanna, and (written in
    a much later hand) the beginning verses of Esther. This (part
    of the) manuscript was classified as 8g1 in the classification
    system of the Leiden Peshitta Institute [Peshitta Institute
    1968, 135].</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P10"/>[10] The
    second part of the manuscript (f. 52-94), also datable to the
    eighth century, contains an imperfectly preserved "Book of
    women", consisting of the following sections: Esther (of which
    the beginning is missing), Judith, Thecla, Tobit (according to
    the Septuagint). This (part of the) manuscript was classified
    as 8f1 in the classification system of the Leiden Peshitta
    Institute. It was used in the Leiden edition of Tobit, for
    which book it is the earliest witness of the Syro-Hexaplaric
    text [Lebram 1972, esp. III-IV].</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P11"/>[11] Our
    observations obviously must be based on the original rather
    than on the composite forms of the manuscripts. While the
    eighth-century manuscript (no. 6) seems to be another witness
    of the "Book of women", including this time Tobit, the new
    sixth-century manuscript (no. 5) presents us with the
    interesting combination of the Book of Daniel and what is
    called here – in biblical fashion – the "Book of
    Thecla". This combination can hardly have been accidental,
    since the predicament to which Daniel was subjected and his
    nearly-martyrdom exhibit some striking similarities to what
    happened to Thecla. Whatever the explanation for this may be,
    we are dealing here with another strategy (different from that
    of the "Book of women") of bringing Thecla in the biblical
    realm, one that associates her not with the New Testament, with
    which the <hi rend="italic">Apocryphal Acts of Paul and Thecla</hi>
    originally were connected, but with the Old Testament, where
    (some) Syrian Christians apparently saw a more appropriate
    context for Thecla's heroic behavior.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P12"/>[12] The
    placement of Thecla in the "Book of women" deserves further
    study. As is well known, the grouping together of the four
    books (Ruth, Susanna, Esther, Judith), with or without the
    title "Book of women", is occasionally found in Syriac biblical
    manuscripts (the earliest example being ms. Milan, Bibliotheca
    Ambrosiana, B 21 Inferiore = 7a1), as well as in some of the
    so-called Masoretic manuscripts. The question, then, is whether
    the "Book of women" originally existed without Thecla and at a
    later moment in history – no later than the sixth century
    – was expanded to include Thecla, or whether the original
    collection included Thecla and was only later reduced to the
    four "biblical" books.  The issue of the association of
    Thecla with Old Testament women is the subject of a forthcoming
    article by Catherine Burris [Burris 2002].</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P13"/>[13] All
    the manuscripts discussed thus far belong to, or were preserved
    within, the Syrian-Orthodox tradition. However, the Thecla
    text  also occurs in East-Syriac manuscripts. Four
    manuscripts deserve to be mentioned here. The Berlin manuscript
    (no. 8) was briefly referred to by Baumstark in 1902. The three
    others have never been studied in detail; two of them
    unfortunately are not easily accessible.</p>

         </list>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P14"/>[14] The
    four manuscripts have in common that they are of a recent date
    and that the Thecla text is part of a large collection of
    hagiographical texts. This context is comparable, therefore, to
    what was said above with regard to manuscripts nos. 3 and
    4.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P15"/>[15]
    Summarizing the data of the new manuscripts listed so far, we
    may distinguish three contexts in which the Thecla text has
    been transmitted: first, the "Book of women" (nos. 1, 2, 6),
    second, the combination Daniel-Thecla (no. 5), third, different
    types of large hagiographical collections (nos. 3, 4, 7, 8, 9,
    and 10).</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P16"/>[16] In
    the next manuscript, the last to be discussed here (no. 11), we
    see yet another category, which shares some characteristics
    with the "Book of women," and others with the large
    hagiographical collections.</p>
         <list type="ordered">
            <item>Mount Sinai, Library of the Monastery of Saint Catherine,
      Syr. 30</item>
         </list>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P17"/>[17] The
    manuscript in question is the famous Sinai palimpsest, which in
    its earlier layer of writing contains the Old Syriac Gospels.
    It was reused in 779, or perhaps in 698, when the monk John the
    Stylite of Bet Mar Qanun, working near Antioch, wrote his
    "Select narratives of holy women"
    (<hi rend="italic">taš<hi rend="sup">c</hi>yâtâ
    mgabbyâtâ d-<hi rend="sup">c</hi>al
    neššê qaddišâtâ</hi>)
    [Smith Lewis 1900; Hatch 1946, 97]. The list of the holy women
    opens with Thecla ("Book of the blessed Mart Thecla, disciple
    of Paul, the blessed apostle") and then continues as follows:
    Eugenia, Pelagia, Marina, Euphrosyne, Onesima, Drusis, Barbara,
    Mary, Irene, Euphemia, Sophia, Theodosia, Theodota, (the
    biblical) Susanna, Cyprian and Justa. The work also contains a
    short creed and, at the end, "strophes of Mar Ephrem, from the
    Hymns on Paradise", reproducing sections from Ephrem's sixth
    and seventh Hymns on Paradise (VI, 8, 12-13, 18, 23-24, and
    VII, 14 and 17), counted as the seventeenth piece in the
    scribe's (or the original redactor's?) table of contents of the
    "Book of select narratives" [Smith Lewis 1900, 280 (Syriac) and
    205-206 (translation)]. The Thecla text of this manuscript has
    not been published. The editor of the "Select narratives" has
    limited herself to collating the manuscript against Wright's
    edition and to listing the variants [Smith Lewis 1900, Syriac
    text, 290-305].</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P18"/>[18] This
    manuscript may suggest the intersection of varying
    understandings of Thecla and her place in Syrian
    Christianity.  The stories of Thecla and Susanna remind us
    of the "Book of women".  However, the other biblical women
    are absent, and instead, one finds a number of Christian,
    women. This collection, while similar in form to the
    hagiographical collections mentioned above, is importantly
    different in its content.  The other collections are
    mainly, albeit not exclusively, devoted to male saints; this
    one is exclusively female, again echoing the "Book of
    women."</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P19"/>[19] The
    manuscript tradition of the Syriac <hi rend="italic">Acts of Paul and
    Thecla</hi> is not the only source of evidence for the place of
    Thecla in Syriac Christianity.  When we consider the
    reception of the text and the popularity of the saint, we find
    important evidence, roughly contemporaneous to manuscripts 1
    and 5 above. Among the <hi rend="italic">Cathedral Homilies</hi> of
    Severus of Antioch (Syrian-Orthodox patriarch from 512 to 518),
    there is one homily (no. 97) entirely devoted to "the
    protomartyr Thecla", delivered on Thecla's feast day (September
    24). Except for a number of fragments, the <hi rend="italic">Cathedral
    Homilies</hi> have not been preserved in Greek. They
    circulated, however, in a Syriac translation around the middle
    of the sixth century, and the earliest witness of homily no. 97
    (ms. Rome, Vat. Syr. 142) has the year 576 as its <hi rend="italic">terminus
    ante quem</hi>. This version of the homily has remained
    unpublished; the text published by Brière [Brière
    1943, 122(566) – 138(582)] is the translation of Jacob of
    Edessa (d. 708), which is a revision of the earlier, mid-sixth
    century translation [Van Rompay, forthcoming, with further
    references].</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P20"/>[20] For
    Severus, who extensively paraphrases passages of the <hi rend="italic">Acts
    of Paul and Thecla</hi>, Thecla is above all an image of the
    church [cf. Pesthy 1996, 173-175]. Later in the homily, he
    explicitly refers to the many women who zealously imitate
    Thecla for her virginity and martyrdom, even though they fall
    short of a complete imitation. With regard to the cutting of
    Thecla's hair, her preaching, and teaching, Severus maintains
    that women are not allowed to follow Thecla's example, since
    this is against the overall legislation of the church. Thecla's
    sufferings are compared to those of the three condemned to the
    fiery furnace (Daniel 3) as well as to Daniel in the lions' den
    (Daniel 6). Severus may or may not be aware of a tradition or a
    written collection that associates Thecla with Old Testament
    women, but his use of Daniel in this context strongly suggests
    that he is aware at least of the tradition behind manuscript
    no. 5.  Further evidence of this awareness may be apparent
    in two other of Severus' homilies (nos. 71 and 75), where the
    mention of Daniel as an example of a holy person overcoming
    wild animals and a perilous situation is immediately followed
    by a reference to Thecla [Brière 1915, 69(351) and
    130(412)].  After his discussion of Daniel in the homily
    on Thecla (no. 97), Severus briefly points to the Thecla shrine
    in Seleucia, where healings and miracles are performed. In
    general, Severus' comments – in their Greek and Syriac
    text forms – give us some glimpses of the background
    against which the contemporary developments in the transmission
    of the Thecla text took place, and suggest that the
    Daniel-Thecla pairing witnessed only in manuscript no. 5 was
    not unique to the writer of that manuscript.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P21"/>[21] As
    was the case with the manuscripts of the <hi rend="italic">Acts of Paul and
    Thecla</hi>, our other evidence is not limited to the
    West-Syrian world, either. The popularity of Thecla and the
    effect it had on women's piety are evident in the <hi rend="italic">Life of
    Febronia</hi>, most likely a late sixth or early seventh
    century composition to be located in Nisibis [Davis 2001,
    125-126; Brock &amp; Ashbrook Harvey 1987, 150-176].  The
    Manichaean Psalm-Book, which is preserved in Coptic [Davis
    2001, 100-101, with further references], but probably goes back
    to an Aramaic original, quotes and praises Thecla, providing an
    indirect witness to her renown in pre-Islamic Persia. Her
    popularity may also be seen in the fact that two different
    women, martyred in Persia [Brock &amp; Ashbrook Harvey 1987, 77
    and 78-81], were named after her.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P22"/>[22] If
    in fact the presence of namesakes contributes to our
    understanding of Thecla's popularity, as Davis believes it does
    for Egypt [Davis 2001, 201-208], it may not be without
    significance that two women closely associated with illustrious
    East-Syrian holy men bear the name of Thecla. The first is the
    mother of Rabban Hormizd, the famous recluse of Northern Iraq
    [Budge 1902, I, 9 (Syriac); II,1, 14 and II,2, 329
    (translation)]. The second is one of the sisters of Mar
    Awgên, who is said to have introduced Egyptian
    monasticism to Mesopotamia. His monastery near Nisibis is said
    to contain the tomb of the saint as well as the tombs of his
    two sisters, Thecla and Stratonice [Fiey 1977, 138]. Thecla
    seems to have been regarded as an appropriate name for women
    accompanying venerable men, after the example of Thecla, Paul's
    companion. Unfortunately, these traditions cannot be dated.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P23"/>[23]
    Neither, unfortunately, can the origins of the living Syrian
    Thecla-traditions be clearly dated. Davis briefly mentions the
    Monastery of St. Thecla at Ma<hi rend="sup">c</hi>lula near Damascus,
    but refrains from further discussion, as "the date of origin
    for the site is uncertain" [Davis 2001, 84, note 8].
    Admittedly, his statement is correct. However, the region
    between Damascus and Homs (Emesa) has known an uninterrupted
    history of Christian presence until today and it is, at first
    sight, unlikely that the Thecla cult would have been introduced
    at a recent date. Other places in the area seem to have been
    associated with Thecla [Thoumin 1929; Peña 2000, 30,
    244-245, 248-249], although here again clear evidence of great
    antiquity is lacking.  The case of an undated Syriac
    inscription invoking Saint Thecla (<hi rend="italic">qaddištâ
    Mart(y) Taqla</hi>), found on a column located to the East of
    Aleppo [Jarry 1967, 157; Peña 2000, 30] may be the
    exception.  Not only in this part of Syria, but also in
    adjacent Lebanon, Thecla is, up to the present day, one of the
    most popular saints [Fiey 1978, 40-41].</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P24"/>[24] In
    spite of the very provisional character of our observations, we
    hope to have shown that the isolated pieces of information
    concerning the literary tradition and the cult of Thecla in the
    area of Syriac Christianity deserve to be brought together and
    to be developed into a comprehensive study, a counterpart to
    Davis' extremely valuable book on the Thecla cult in Egypt.</p>

         <head>Abstract</head>
         <p rend="Abstract">The Daughters of the Covenant held a
    distinctive office in Syriac Christianity, notable (and
    possibly unique) for its public ministry of sacred music
    performed for liturgical purposes in civic churches. Syriac
    tradition ascribed the establishment of these choirs of
    consecrated virgins to Ephrem Syrus.� Jacob of Serug�s
    <hi rend="italic">Homily on St. Ephrem</hi> presents these choirs as modeling
    soteriological as well as eschatological significance for the
    larger church community. This paper examines the context and
    content of what these choirs sang, in order to assess what
    authority this ministry carried for the ancient Syriac
    churches, and to suggest possible social
    implications.</p>

         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P1"/>[1] Among
    modern scholars, one of the best known characteristics of
    ancient Syriac Christianity is the institution of the Sons and
    Daughters of the Covenant, the <hi rend="italic">Bnay</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Bnat
    Qyama</hi>. Apparently originating in the third century CE, the
    office was characterized by vows of celibacy, voluntary
    poverty, and service to the local priest or bishop.�Members
    were supposed to live separately with others of the same
    office, or with their families. The office appears to have been
    wide-spread in Syriac-speaking territories both east and west
    by the fourth century.<ref target="#FN1">1</ref> The early fourth century <hi rend="italic">Acts of the
    Edessan Martyrs Shmona and Guria</hi> note that Daughters of
    the Covenant were being specially targeted, along with priests
    and deacons, for public torture and execution during the
    Diocletianic persecution, attesting their public
    prominence.<ref target="#FN2">2</ref> The <hi rend="italic">Acts of the Persian Martyrs</hi> shortly
    thereafter recall similar treatment of Daughters of the
    Covenant during the persecutions of Shapur II.<ref target="#FN3">3</ref> Among the first
    group of <hi rend="italic">Demonstrations</hi> written by Aphrahat the
    Persian Sage in 337 is the renowned <hi rend="italic">Demonstration</hi> 6,
    on the Members of the Covenant.<ref target="#FN4">4</ref>��The treatise is a lengthy
    exhortation addressed particularly to the men of that group on
    the importance of maintaining their vows of celibacy, and on
    the eschatological significance of those vows.�In the fifth
    century, evidence increases with references from canonical
    legislation, historical chronicles, homiletic and
    hagiographical literature all contributing to form a picture of
    a church office of men and women actively engaged in civic
    ecclesiastical activity, in terms that rendered it quite
    distinct from the contemporaneously developing monastic
    movement.�Indeed, monasticism did not replace this office.
    References continue certainly until the tenth century and more
    rarely into the middle ages.<ref target="#FN5">5</ref>
         </p>
         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P2"/>[2] On
    closer examination, however, evidence for the office of
    Covenanter is frustratingly thin. References may abound, but
    they are often only that: passing mention that Members of the
    Covenant were included in an incident. Most frustrating of all,
    at least for the historian of women, is that the majority of
    references to this office specifically refer to the men—the
    Sons of the Covenant.�These are the primary addressees and
    concern of Aphrahat�s <hi rend="italic">Demonstration</hi> 6 in the fourth
    century; they are the primary target of Rabbula�s canonical
    legislation in the fifth century, and they are the most
    frequently mentioned in historical texts.�If we want to
    understand this office as it was exercised by women, we have
    precious little with which to work.</p>
         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P3"/>[3] Given
    the elusive nature of the evidence, recent scholarship—notably
    by Robert Murray, Sidney Griffith, and Naomi Koltun-Fromm—has
    focused on understanding the nature of the vow that underlay
    the office, and the perceived meaning or role of the Members of
    the Covenant within the larger congregation of Christian
    believers.<ref target="#FN6">6</ref> From a different vantage point, other scholars,
    including Joseph Amar, Kathleen McVey, and myself, have drawn
    attention to an important but little considered aspect of the
    work of the female members of this office:�that of the
    liturgical choirs of the Daughters of the Covenant.<ref target="#FN7">7</ref> For one
    thing we do know is that Daughters of the Covenant were charged
    with the task of singing psalms and various kinds of hymns in
    certain liturgical celebrations of the civic churches.�This
    practice contrasted sharply, for example, with the normal
    pattern of Greek and Latin civic churches to the west. These
    areas permitted women�s singing in convent choirs, to be
    sure.�But with the possible exception of Ambrose�s cathedral in
    Milan, women�s voices were excluded from choral participation
    in civic liturgical celebration.<ref target="#FN8">8</ref>�In other words, one of the
    most visibly concrete forms of public ministry conducted by the
    Daughters of the Covenant was that of sacred music, performed
    in the congregational gatherings of the larger church
    community, male and female, ordained and lay. In this study, I
    would like to consider what we know about this musical ministry
    of the Daughters of the Covenant, and what the implications of
    that ministry may have been for the public place of women in
    late antique Syriac Christianity.</p>
         <head xml:id="S1">Singing Women</head>
         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P4"/>[4] The
    first explicit reference we have for the liturgical singing of
    the Daughters of the Covenant comes in the fifth century
    Rabbula Canons.<ref target="#FN9">9</ref> Canon 20 of this collection assigns the
    Daughters of the Covenant the mandatory task of singing the
    Psalms and especially the doctrinal hymns (<hi rend="italic">madrashe</hi>)
    of the church.�Further, canon 27 requires the Daughters of the
    Covenant to observe the worship services of the church,
    including the daily offices, together with the other clergy and
    the Sons of the Covenant. Other canons of this collection
    prohibit the clergy and Sons of the Covenant from requiring
    non-religious services of the Daughters of the Covenant (e.g.,
    housekeeping or weaving), and restrict the social and economic
    activities available to these women.�Canons 12, 15, and 19 call
    for village and town churches to provide the economic support
    necessary for poor Sons and Daughters of the Covenant, thereby
    safeguarding their liturgical duties on behalf of the church
    community.</p>
         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P5"/>[5] It is
    interesting to note that the liturgical role assigned to the
    Daughters of the Covenant, of psalmody and singing the
    <hi rend="italic">madrashe</hi>, granted these women a more central function
    in the ritual life of the Christian community than that
    accorded deaconesses or widows at this time.�Church orders and
    canon collections of the period severely limit the devotional
    activities of widows, confining them largely to prayer
    practices in their homes or in churches.�Deaconesses were
    accorded more socially substantive duties.�They were allowed to
    visit and instruct female catechumens and women who were
    ill;�they assisted at the baptism of women, and were charged
    with keeping order in the women�s sections of the churches
    during liturgies.�However, their ministry was clearly marked as
    one by women, for women.<ref target="#FN10">10</ref>�By contrast, the role of civic
    liturgical singing placed the Daughters of the Covenant in the
    midst of the entire worshipping community.</p>
         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P6"/>[6] Around
    the same time the Rabbula Canons were collected, the Synod of
    410 was convoked by Maruta of Maipherqat for the Church of the
    East in Persia.�Among the canons of this Synod, a number
    address the importance of cultivating the order of the Members
    of the Covenant particularly in the villages, to provide a pool
    for clergy and to assist in the maintenance of a devotional
    life for the churches in sparsely populated regions.<ref target="#FN11">11</ref>
    Further canons clarified the ordering of women's ministry: "It
    is the will of the general synod that the town churches shall
    not be without the order [<hi rend="italic">taxis</hi>] of sisters" (canon
    41).<ref target="#FN12">12</ref>�The Daughters of the Covenant were to be under
    the direction of a superior chosen from among them and made a
    deaconess for service at baptisms;�under her supervision, they
    were to be instructed in Scripture and in psalmody.�These
    canons appear to have been widely used among western and
    eastern Syriac communities, and similar instructions are found
    in the sixth century canons attributed to John of Tella
    (Iohannan bar Qursos).<ref target="#FN13">13</ref>
         </p>
         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P7"/>[7] An
    example of the situation envisioned here is the case recorded
    by John of Ephesus in the sixth century, of the holy man Simeon
    the Mountaineer.<ref target="#FN14">14</ref>�Wandering the eastern borders between
    Roman and Persian territory as a recluse, Simeon stumbled on a
    remote, widely scattered semi-nomadic community that had no
    apparent Christian presence.�Immediately Simeon set about
    evangelizing and baptizing the villagers, building a church,
    and establishing a canonically governed ecclesiastical life for
    the people. One of his first tasks was to round up the
    children, lock them inside the church (under the pretense of
    giving them special gifts!) and tonsure them as Sons and
    Daughters of the Covenant. When some families protested, their
    children were struck dead in divine punishment.�But those who
    remained in their new office, Simeon instructed in a special
    school in scripture and psalmody, and "thenceforward loud
    choirs were to be heard at the service."�As the years went by,
    these children grew to become "readers and Daughters of the
    Covenant, and they were themselves teaching others also."�Thus
    Simeon did not fear his old age and approaching death when the
    time came, for through these Members of the Covenant the
    Christian life of the villagers would continue in proper
    order.<ref target="#FN15">15</ref>
         </p>
         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P8"/>[8] It is
    often the case, however, that Syriac writers refer to virgins
    singing psalms or hymns without explicitly identifying them as
    Daughters of the Covenant.�Whether this is due to a pragmatic
    flexibility of terminology, or to diversity of ecclesiastical
    practice—or simply to a looser mode of institutionalization
    than characterizes later practice—is unclear. Scholars have
    tended to read all references to consecrated virgins as
    indicating Daughters of the Covenant;�perhaps the terms could
    be inclusive of all �virgins� who might participate, including
    the young unmarried girls who were not necessarily dedicated to
    life-long celibacy. In his hymns, Ephrem Syrus (d. 373)
    occasionally refers to choirs of women, apparently
    consecrated�virgins, singing his compositions.�For example, in
    <hi rend="italic">Hymns on Nativity</hi> 4:</p>
         <quote>
      May the chant of chaste women please You, my Lord,<lb/>
      May the chant of the chaste women dispose You, my Lord,<lb/>
      To keep their bodies in chastity.<ref target="#FN16">16</ref>
         </quote>
         <p>Similar references are sprinkled throughout subsequent
    Syriac hymnography.<ref target="#FN17">17</ref> In a homily on the Visitation of Mary to
    Elizabeth, Jacob of Serug (d. 521) presents Mary exhorting a
    women�s choir to song:</p>
         <quote>
      Let all the multitude of virgins praise Him with
      wonder,<lb/>
      Because the great savior shines forth from them to the whole
      world.<lb/>
      Let the voice of the young women be lifted up in
      praise,<lb/>
      Because by one of them, behold, hope is brought to the
      world.<ref target="#FN18">18</ref>
         </quote>
         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P9"/>[9] Ephrem
    and Jacob are in fact the most important sources for our
    understanding of the Daughters of the Covenant as liturgical
    singers.�Perhaps the most cautious reading would be to see a
    certain melding of traditions that becomes settled in the sixth
    century.�In the passage I just quoted, Jacob purports to speak
    in the voice of the Virgin Mary as she addresses her cousin
    Elizabeth.�Her words summon forth the women�s choirs who would
    come to sing the hymns assigned by the canonical sources.�It is
    from Jacob that we have our most extensive description of these
    choirs, which he does not name as Daughters of the Covenant. In
    his panegyric homily in commemoration of Ephrem,<ref target="#FN19">19</ref> Jacob claims
    that Ephrem himself had founded the choirs of consecrated
    virgins. Jacob defends the tradition, boldly citing sacramental
    authority for the justification of women�s choirs in the
    church:�by one baptism are men and women cleansed, he declares,
    and from one eucharist do they receive. Christ offers one
    salvation for all people, male and female, therefore all are
    free to sing God's praise.�Jacob further argues from Eve-Mary
    typology, that where Eve had closed the mouths of women in
    shame, Mary had opened them in glory.</p>
         <p rend="nn">
            <anchor xml:id="P10"/>[10]
    According to Jacob, Ephrem had founded these choirs explicitly
    to instruct the congregation of Edessa in right doctrine.
    Roughly contemporary with Jacob's discussion of Ephrem, the
    Syriac <hi rend="italic">Vita Ephraemi</hi> (6<hi rend="sup">th</hi> century)
    identified these women's choirs specifically as composed of the
    Daughters of the Covenant, whom Ephrem convened for the morning
    and evening services in the church at Edessa and at the
    memorial services of saints and martyrs.<ref target="#FN20">20</ref>�Both depictions
    are notable for their emphasis on the instructional role these
    choirs played in educating the larger Christian community in
    matters of orthodoxy and heresy.�Jacob, in fact, frankly names
    the women in these choirs <hi rend="italic">malpanyatha</hi>,
    teachers.<ref target="#FN21">21</ref>�The term Jacob uses is the feminine form of
    <hi rend="italic">malpana</hi> (masc. Teacher), one of the most revered
    titles in Syriac tradition, indicating not only the teaching of
    the Syriac language, but further, its proper (doctrinal)
    understanding.<ref target="#FN22">22</ref> Its application to women, especially with
    respect to religious instruction, is startling.�According to
    the <hi rend="italic">Vita</hi>, Ephrem trained the Daughters of the Covenant
    to sing a variety of hymnography:�doctrinal hymns
    (<hi rend="italic">madrashe</hi>), antiphons (<hi rend="italic">'ounyatha</hi>), and other
    kinds of songs (<hi rend="italic">seblatha</hi> and <hi rend="italic">qinyatha</hi>).�To
    these melodic forms, the <hi rend="italic">Vita</hi> continues,</p>
         <quote>
      [Ephrem set words] with subtle connotation and spiritual
      understanding concerning the birth and baptism and fasting
      and the entire plan of Christ:�the passion and resurrection
      and ascension and concerning the martyrs. ... [W]ho would not
      be astounded nor filled with fervent faith to see the athlete
      of Christ [Ephrem] amid the ranks of the Daughters of the
      Covenant, chanting songs, metrical hymns, and
      melodies!<ref target="#FN23">23</ref>
         </quote>
         <p rend="nn">
            <anchor xml:id="P11"/>[11]
    According to the <hi rend="italic">Vita Ephraemi</hi>, then, the Daughters of
    the Covenant were trained to sing on matters explicating the
    entire salvation drama, as well as the devotional life of
    Christians, and about the saints—almost the exact list of
    topics expressly forbidden for widows to teach about in the
    Syriac <hi rend="italic">Didascalia Apostolorum</hi>!<ref target="#FN24">24</ref>�But thus, by the
    sixth century, the Syriac practice of women�s choirs and the
    musical ministry of the Daughters of the Covenant had received
    the unequivocal authority of Ephrem as founding father.</p>
         <p rend="nn">
            <anchor xml:id="P12"/>[12] The
    musical ministry of the Daughters of the Covenant was further
    confirmed at the East Syriac Synod of Mar George I in 676,
    where Canon 9 identifies the most important work of these women
    as the chanting of the psalms at the offices of the church, as
    well as the singing of hymns in funeral processions (but not at
    the cemetery), at the memorial services for the dead, and at
    vigil services.<ref target="#FN25">25</ref>�After the seventh century, it becomes
    increasingly difficult to distinguish between the offices of
    deaconess and Daughter of the Covenant, whose roles and
    functions seem eventually combined into a skeleton of their
    earlier duties.�In the ninth century, ps-George of Arbela
    states (rather grumpily) that congregations must endure women�s
    choirs because the women represent the Egyptians and
    Babylonians, under whose domination the Israelites were kept
    enslaved: the faithful must not forget the role of humiliation
    in the divine dispensation.<ref target="#FN26">26</ref> In the Middle Ages, the term
    Daughter of the Covenant appears to have become synonymous with
    "nun".<ref target="#FN27">27</ref>�However, there is a poignancy in the witness
    offered by one late manuscript giving a service of ordination
    for deaconesses in which the terms "deaconess" and
    "chantress"�are used interchangably.<ref target="#FN28">28</ref>�Perhaps we might
    see this as a lingering memory of the importance of the choirs
    of the Daughters of the Covenant in the liturgical life of the
    larger church community—choirs whose function was not simply to
    sing the responses (as in the <hi rend="italic">Testament of Our Lord</hi>,
    40), nor only to chant the Psalms, but further, to instruct the
    congregation through hymnography in the substance and form of
    right belief.</p>
         <head xml:id="S2">Teaching Women</head>
         <p rend="nn">
            <anchor xml:id="P13"/>[13] What
    did the Daughters of the Covenant sing? Elsewhere, I have been
    trying to address this question.<ref target="#FN29">29</ref> It is, I think, crucial to
    consider the types and�forms of hymnography sung by these
    choirs in liturgical settings, for the civic churches.<ref target="#FN30">30</ref>�I�sketch the issues in summary fashion here,
    but I hope their significance will be clear, in light of the
    kind of evidence we have just been considering.�Syriac
    Christianity has always placed enormous weight on the
    instructional role of the liturgy—on the liturgy as the primary
    teaching context of the church.<ref target="#FN31">31</ref> Two areas of the liturgy
    were explicitly utilized for this purpose:�homilies
    (<hi rend="italic">mimre</hi>) and hymns (<hi rend="italic">madrashe</hi>).�The
    <hi rend="italic">madrashe</hi> were the most important form of hymn used for
    this purpose, but not the only one; and <hi rend="italic">madrashe</hi>
    themselves were of varied kinds.�One of the favorite types of
    teaching employed by Syriac homilists and hymn writers was the
    presentation of biblical stories in imaginatively elaborated
    form, starting from the base of a biblical text and re-telling
    the story through the eyes—and especially through the imagined
    words—of its characters.<ref target="#FN32">32</ref> The rhetorical technique of
    imagined speech, sometimes in the form of soliloquies and
    sometimes in dialogue with other biblical characters, was an
    often used and brilliantly engaged aspect of Syriac homiletic
    and hymnographic instruction.�Among the vast corpus of such
    texts surviving to us (by Ephrem, Jacob of Serug, Narsai, and
    the whole host of anonymous authors and composers), a sizeable
    portion present the stories of biblical women:�Sarah the wife
    of Abraham, Tamar, Potiphar�s Wife, the Widow of Sarepta, the
    Virgin Mary, the Sinful Woman who anointed the feet of Christ
    with her tears (in Syriac tradition, not to be confused with
    Mary Magdalene).�In the hands of Syriac writers, this meant
    composing long and sometimes elaborate speeches and dialogues
    for female characters whom the Bible made important, but who in
    their scriptural texts were silent or barely granted brief
    comments.�Major theological themes were addressed through this

    tension.<ref target="#FN33">33</ref>

    These different literary forms were performed in liturgical
    settings in a variety of ways, each carrying different ritual
    significance.�The <hi rend="italic">madrashe</hi>—such as Ephrem�s <hi rend="italic">Hymns
    on the Nativity</hi>, in which Mary�s voice is a frequent and
    extensive feature of the hymns—were often sung by women�s
    choirs.�Some <hi rend="italic">madrashe</hi> were stanzaic with a refrain;
    the male leader (Ephrem) may have sung the stanzas, and the
    women�s choirs the refrain, or the choirs may have sung the
    stanzas and the congregation the refrain. <hi rend="italic">Sogyatha</hi>,
    dialogue hymns, were sung antiphonally, apparently by both male
    and female choirs.�These often presented a biblical story
    through an imagined dialogic exchange between the characters
    (Sarah and Abraham, Mary and the Archangel Gabriel or Joseph,
    the Sinful Woman and Satan).�In these cases, the woman�s voice
    was sung by the women�s choir.�The verse homilies
    (<hi rend="italic">mimre</hi>), by contrast, would have been chanted by the
    male preacher.�In the case of Jacob of Serug�s homilies on
    Mary, for example, these would include long passages of Mary�s
    imagined speech, but presented through the intoned voice of the
    male homilist.�Certainly it is crucial to read and interpret
    these texts with consideration of their literary forms and
    constraints (meter, strophes, stanzas, responses; the
    presentation of narrative, exegetical exposition, speech in
    monologue or dialogue). Yet I would argue that it is equally
    critical to consider the performative requirements of the
    composer�s chosen form, and how performance would have shaped
    presentation.�What was said in an imagined dialogue, in the
    retelling of a biblical story, in the recalling of a saint�s
    holy life (as in Jacob�s homily on Ephrem), was qualitatively
    changed by who said it, from what narrative perspective, in
    what ritual context, and with what performative features.</p>
         <p rend="nn">
            <anchor xml:id="P15"/>[15] In
    performance, Syriac hymns and homilies differed in the degree
    to which they were inclusive of women�s voices in the ritual
    context of their presentation.�In content, they also differed
    in where and when they located the voices of female
    characters.�Ephrem often elided biblical past and historical
    present, locating women�s sacred speech from the mythic
    (biblical) past in the midst of the gathered congregation in
    its present worship.�The dialogue hymns performed women�s
    voices as liturgical drama, setting women�s voices in high
    relief; yet these hymns placed their voices within specific
    narrative moments of the church�s salvation story, as
    characters from a past event. A homilist such as Jacob of Serug
    would enclose women�s voices within the clear boundaries of
    narrated story and right interpretation, and within that
    narration construct the socially and culturally appropriate
    constraints on female speech.�Intoned in the spaces of civic
    ritual through the mediation of a male priest, these words
    would then be echoed by the ritually authorized and ritually
    contained voices of women�s choirs.<ref target="#FN34">34</ref>�I suggest that these
    different modes of performance all contributed substantially to
    the teaching presented through the story at hand. Women�s
    voices imagined and real were necessary to that teaching.�How
    were those voices heard?</p>

         <p rend="nn">
            <anchor xml:id="P16"/>[16] The
    only extensive discussion we have of these women�s choirs is
    found in Jacob of Serug�s homily on Ephrem. Indeed, the space
    alone that Jacob allots to the matter is striking: in a
    panegyric composed a century or more after the great saint�s
    death, nearly one third is devoted to women�s choirs and their
    singing, 47 couplets out of a possible 187.�His discussion
    merits closer scrutiny.<ref target="#FN35">35</ref>

         <p rend="nn">
            <anchor xml:id="P17"/>[17] In
    contrast to other panegyrical homilies that Jacob composed on
    saints—for example, his homilies on the Edessan Martyrs Shmona,
    Guria, and Habib, or the one on Simeon the Stylite—this one
    contains virtually no narrative of the saint�s life.�Instead,
    Jacob praises Ephrem for his extraordinary skill as
    hymnographer, dwelling at length on the unparalleled beauty and
    profundity of his theological teaching. Amidst this general
    exaltation of Ephrem�s craft, Jacob claims that Ephrem founded
    choirs of women where there had been none. Ephrem was initially
    prompted to do so, Jacob says, because in the task of composing
    hymns and homilies adequate for teaching God�s truth, he
    realized the eschatological significance of women�s
    participation.</p>

    According to Jacob, then, Ephrem�s choirs do more than proclaim
    that with Christianity a new era has dawned for humanity.�They
    enact that new dispensation by the very fact that they include
    female as well as male voices.�The use of these choirs is
    startling: despite the Pauline admonition for women�s silence,
    Ephrem presents his church with �a new sight of women uttering
    the proclamation.��Nor does Jacob pull punches here.�The term
    he uses is <hi rend="italic">karuzutha</hi>, the Syriac equivalent for
    <hi rend="italic">kerygma</hi>.�These women sing the full doctrinal
    proclamation of the church.�Rightly so, then, are �they called

    <hi rend="italic">malpanyatha</hi>;�by Jacob�s reckoning, these women sing
    the very teaching by which Christianity exists, by which
    salvation has come.�So dramatic is the act of women in this
    role, that Jacob declares it images �an entirely new world�.�In
    Jacob�s account, just as men and women are equal in the
    heavenly kingdom to come, so, too, is that kingdom imaged and
    anticipated in the Syriac liturgy with its male and female
    choirs.</p>

    Jacob�s defense of Ephrem then moves from eschatology to
    typology.�Moses had led the Hebrew women in song at the
    crossing of the Red Sea, summoning them to celebrate the
    deliverance of the Hebrews from the Egyptians.�So, too, did
    Ephrem lead the Syrian women in hymns to celebrate the
    deliverance of humanity from the powers of sin and
    death.�Omitting Miriam�s role in the biblical account, Jacob
    presents both men as liberators who declare a new freedom of
    worship for women.�For Jacob, Ephrem�s action is a logical
    result of sacramental mandate, for men and women participate in
    salvation by the same means, first by baptism, then by the
    eucharist.�He portrays Ephrem calling the women to song:</p>
         <quote>
            <p rend="nn">105. You [O women] put on glory from the midst
      of the waters like your brothers,<lb/>

            <p rend="nn">106.�You have partaken of a single forgiving
      body with your brothers,<lb/>
      And from a single cup of new life you have been

      (alike);�why then<lb/>
      Have you not learned to sing praise with a loud voice?</p>
         </quote>
         <p>Unequivocally justified by the sacramental practices of the
    church, Ephrem�s choirs themselves represent a further
    typological fulfillment, soteriological in its impact.�For Eve
    had closed the mouths of women in shame by her disobedience at
    the Fall.�But�the Virgin Mary opened them again, loosening
    their bonds, opening the closed door of their tongues, and
    restoring the voices of women.</p>

         <p rend="nn">
            <anchor xml:id="P20"/>[20] By
    just such exhortations, Jacob declares, did Ephrem establish
    the women�s choirs, granting them the responsibility of
    chanting �instructive melodies� (<hi rend="italic">qale d-malpanutha</hi>).
    And by such melodies were the efforts of the heretics laid low,
    as the church triumphed in orthodoxy through the �soft tones�
    of the women (vv. 114, 152).</p>

    Jacob�s justification of Ephrem�s establishment of the women�s
    choirs is fourfold:�eschatological, typological, sacramental,
    soteriological.�So formidable is his effort, in fact, that
    Kathleen McVey has argued for reading this homily as a defense
    of women�s choirs in the wake of an ecclesiastical attack on
    their validity—whether from Greek churches to the west
    (Antioch?), or from rivalries within Syriac doctrinal circles
    locked in fierce debate at the time.<ref target="#FN36">36</ref>�But we simply
    cannot know.�Greek sources are as silent on these Syriac choirs
    as were Greek women in their liturgies.�In Syriac churches, the
    women�s choirs have continued to the present day, although
    Jacob�s homily is rarely remembered.<ref target="#FN37">37</ref>�We are left,
    then, with something of a puzzle:�how to account for these
    women�s choirs of the Daughters of the Covenant, and indeed,
    for Jacob�s extraordinary defense of them.</p>
         <p rend="nn">
            <anchor xml:id="P22"/>[22] One
    other ancient source presents a fairly similar understanding of
    the significance of male and female choirs: Philo of
    Alexandria�s account of the Therapeutae, in his treatise <hi rend="italic">On
    the Contemplative Life</hi>.�Philo describes this philosophical
    community and its utopian (or eschatological) existence at some
    length.�Towards the end of the treatise, in section 8, he
    explicitly mentions the women of the community, �aged virgins�
    committed as eagerly as the men to the perfect philosophical
    life of devotion to God.�Every seven weeks, Philo says, the men
    and women gather for a festal banquet, the men sitting on the
    right and the women on the left (section 9).�Following the
    food,�instruction on the scriptures is given by the president
    (section 10). When the teaching is complete, first the
    president and then the entire community join in song.�In two
    choirs, the men and women sing sacred hymns all night, of many
    kinds, of different rhythms, sometimes with clapping or
    dancing.�Here, too, is the typology of the singing at the Red
    Sea recalled, and Miriam as prototype for the leader of the
    women�s choir, along with Moses for the men. �Modeled above all
    on this (the singing at the Red Sea),� Philo states, �the choir
    of the Therapeutae, both male and female, singing in harmony,
    the soprano of the women blending with the bass of the men,
    produces true musical concord. Exceeding beautiful are the
    thoughts, exceeding beautiful are the words, and august the
    choristers, and the end goal of thought, words, and choristers
    alike is piety.�<ref target="#FN38">38</ref>
         </p>
         <p rend="nn">
            <anchor xml:id="P23"/>[23] It
    is possible that Jacob knew of Philo�s text.�Eusebius of
    Caesarea�s <hi rend="italic">Ecclesiastical History</hi> was available in
    Syriac in the sixth century, and Bk. 2, 16-7 presents a
    �filtered� account of Philo on the Therapeutae.<ref target="#FN39">39</ref>�But the
    descriptions diverge as much as they resonate.�Even without the
    disputed question of whether or not the Therapeutae existed as
    an historical community, Philo�s account represents the ideal
    philosophical collective—an elite community, living apart from
    mundane society.�Jacob�s description of the women�s choirs
    presents an idealized justification for the practice, to be
    sure.�But the practice, as attested not only in Jacob but in
    dozens of canonical sources, was to be found in every
    Syriac-speaking village, town, and city of late antiquity,
    enacted in the civic churches of the collected populus.�It
    offered a vision of the ideal, enacted in the midst of the
    ordinary.</p>
         <p rend="nn">
            <anchor xml:id="P24"/>[24] Very
    little evidence has survived to us regarding the pre-Christian,
    indigenous religions of the Syrian Orient that continued into
    the Christian period.<ref target="#FN40">40</ref> We know the names and sometimes the
    symbols of deities, and occasionally titular offices.�But of
    practices, we know almost nothing.�Suggestive models can
    sometimes be drawn from Greek traditions to the west,
    however.�In her book <hi rend="italic">Performance and Gender in Ancient
    Greece</hi>, Eva Stehle discusses the significance of ancient
    Greek civic choruses, both male and female, in terms that help
    to illuminate the issues of women�s choirs in the ancient
    Syriac churches.<ref target="#FN41">41</ref>�She argues that civic choruses through
    their performances in religious festivals provided the embodied
    expression of the city itself.�As such, their role was to
    vindicate and affirm civic order as just, good, and worthy of
    admiration (even devotion).�The capacity for this expression
    lay in the chorus� ability to reflect and model the community�s
    most idealized self-understanding.�Reflection, oriented to the
    past, was offered by the chorus� presentation of the city�s
    sacred past:�the great events by which it was formed and bonded
    into a community under the gods� protection.�Modeling, in turn,
    was oriented toward the future: by the harmony and beauty of
    their performance, the chorus represented the community in its
    ideal form.�Gender was essential to the work of these choruses,
    since male and female choirs performed these tasks in distinct,
    differentiated ways.�It is helpful, I think, to consider the
    role of women�s choirs in the Syriac churches in these
    terms.�Indeed, Jacob of Serug had stressed the eschatological
    significance of women�s choirs as signs of the resurrected life
    to come.</p>

    Scholars have given much attention to the capacity of holy
    women in late antiquity to attain high levels of spiritual
    authority among the general populace, and to serve as spiritual
    teachers and counselors.<ref target="#FN42">42</ref>�The model of holy woman as
    authoritative spiritual teacher is, however, founded on a
    pattern of direct, even personal instruction by a mentor to a
    devotee.�The teaching performed by the Daughters of the
    Covenant differed substantially from this model, both in kind
    and in nature.�The content of their teaching was not the
    revealed wisdom of a holy individual, but rather the stated,
    collectively identified corporate doctrines of the
    church.�These choirs through the <hi rend="italic">madrashe</hi> represented
    to the Christian congregation the affirmed, authorized
    teachings they held in common.�Moreover, as liturgical choirs,
    these women taught by their very performance the substance of
    their teaching:�women as well as men received eschatological
    hope through sacramental practice.</p>

    Christianity.�In his <hi rend="italic">Hymns on Easter</hi>, Ephrem exhorts

            <ref target="#FNRef8">8</ref> Or so we assume.�Eusebius, <hi rend="italic">HE</hi> 7. 30.10,
    cites women�s choirs as one of the reasons for Paul of
    Samosata�s expulsion from Antioch, but the problem was perhaps
    not the women�s choirs so much as that the hymns they sang were
    in honor of Paul himself.�Cyril of Jerusalem, <hi rend="italic">Procat</hi>.
    14, exhorts that women should keep absolutely silent in church;
    but he is speaking about catechumens preparing to receive
    baptism.�It is not clear to me that the passage precludes
    choirs (although scholars have assumed it does).�Ambrose,
    <hi rend="italic">Explan. Ps</hi>. 1.9, mentions women�s singing positively,
    directly taking issue with the Pauline admonition that women
    must keep silent in church (1 Cor 14:34); he advocates the
    singing of psalms as beneficial for all people.�Nonetheless,
    the references to women�s choirs that we have, e.g., in the
    Cappadocian Fathers, are to convent choirs of women
    monastics:�consider Basil of Caesarea, <hi rend="italic">Letter</hi> 2, and
    Gregory of Nyssa, <hi rend="italic">Life of Macrina</hi>. See Johannes
    Quasten, �The Liturgical Singing of Women in Christian
    Antiquity,� <hi rend="italic">Catholic Historical Review</hi> 27

    founded these choirs because the heretics, especially the
    Bardaisanites, had been successful at spreading their teachings
    through hymns.�As to why Ephrem chose women�s choirs for this
    task, Jacob does not say.�In the cultural coding of the ancient
    Mediterranean world, however, the female virgin body was the
    premier image for perfection, purity, and intactness.�Perhaps
    the female virgin could thus most effectively image the
    presentation of true doctrine precisely as teaching that was
    perfect, pure, and intact from any external�(unholy)
    penetration.�Heresy was often likened to harlotry by early
    Christian writers;�see, e.g., Virginia Burrus, �The Heretical

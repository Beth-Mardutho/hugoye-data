         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P1"/>[1] Although
    northern Syria holds the remains of hundreds of churches from
    the fourth through seventh centuries, the approximately
    forty-five churches containing a <hi rend="italic">bema</hi>—the large
    horseshoe-shaped platform in the centre of the nave � have
    historically been the most studied structures. The
    architectural evidence for the <hi rend="italic">bema</hi> was presented
    initially by Georges Tchalenko.<ref target="#FN1">1</ref> Since then, there have been
    several books and articles which use the architectural evidence
    to illuminate the literary evidence.<ref target="#FN2">2</ref> Emma Loosley should be
    commended for bringing together the architectural and literary
    evidence in her attempt to prove that these churches are
    located in discernible clusters which may reflect a particular
    school of thought at Antioch.�In <hi rend="italic">The Architecture and
    Liturgy of the Bema in Fourth- to Sixth-Century Syrian
    Churches</hi>, Loosley illustrates the importance of looking at
    both the literary accounts and the physical remains of the
    entire corpus of churches when making observations about the
    architecture and liturgy of the West Syrian church.</p>
         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P2"/>[2] In her
    introduction, Loosley sets out the two major aims to her study:
    to provide an updated account of the <hi rend="italic">bema</hi> churches
    through photographs taken during her own fieldwork and to try
    to establish these churches within the architectural corpus and
    liturgical tradition of the churches of Syria (pp. 21-22). She
    then gives a brief account of the development of early
    Christian architecture (pp. 22-26) and introduces the region
    where the majority of these churches are found, the Limestone
    Massif in north-western Syria (pp. 26-28). The reader is
    subsequently introduced to the problems associated with
    studying the <hi rend="italic">bema</hi> churches, including the issue of how
    the term <hi rend="italic">bema</hi> should be defined when it is used in the
    written sources (pp. 20-30). For example, depending on the
    origin of the source, the term can refer to a large platform in
    the nave or the raised sanctuary area or can be used as a
    synonym for the <hi rend="italic">ambo</hi>. Loosley also briefly discusses
    the use of the <hi rend="italic">bema</hi> in other religious traditions,
    since its origins almost certainly lie outside of Christianity
    (pp. 30-32). Finally, she identifies the major problem in
    defining and explaining the <hi rend="italic">bema</hi>. Although there are
    several extant examples of the <hi rend="italic">bema</hi>, its purpose is
    unclear in the few West Syrian liturgical sources we possess (p
    35).</p>
         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P3"/>[3] The
    introduction identifies a number of the major problems in
    studying the <hi rend="italic">bema</hi> churches. These are issues that
    Loosley goes on to discuss in the remainder of the book, and
    include such things as scholarly reliance on East Syrian
    sources to explain West Syrian liturgy. However, the one area
    that is left unfinished in the introduction (and in the rest of
    the book) is the discussion Loosley begins on the origins of
    early Christian architecture and the development which
    eventually led to the <hi rend="italic">bema</hi> churches (pp. 22-26). The
    evolution of church architecture in Syria from the third
    century house church at Dura Europos to the massive structures
    of the fourth and fifth centuries, including those with
    <hi rend="italic">bemata</hi>, is not clearly presented here. I could not
    help feeling that this short section on the origins of
    Christian architecture could have been expanded into a short
    chapter which would have provided a better context for the
    discussion of the <hi rend="italic">bemata</hi>.</p>
         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P4"/>[4] The
    first chapter of the book is the strongest, and Loosley
    presents a number of new archaeological ideas which should
    restart the discussion about this particular corpus. She
    presents the archaeological evidence for the <hi rend="italic">bema</hi>,
    both in Syria and elsewhere, and discusses the archaeological
    evidence for the origins of the <hi rend="italic">bema</hi> within the
    synagogue architectural tradition (pp. 44-47). Loosley also
    reestablishes several of the facts that we know about these
    churches, including the absence of the <hi rend="italic">bema</hi> from
    monastic churches and the fact that only one <hi rend="italic">bema</hi>
    church is known per settlement. (pp. 43-44). In doing so, she
    addresses the two major theories concerning the construction
    and use of these particular churches: the assertion that all of
    the <hi rend="italic">bema</hi> churches were associated with martyria (pp.
    49-57)<ref target="#FN3">3</ref> and Castellana�s hypothesis that the bema was
    the result of the social or political influence of wealthy
    members of the community (pp.57-64).<ref target="#FN4">4</ref>
         </p>
         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P5"/>[5] In both
    cases, her analysis is absolutely correct. She first dismisses
    the idea that the <hi rend="italic">bema</hi> was only connected to churches
    which had an important relic or holy site affiliated with them.
    She points out that while the majority of the <hi rend="italic">bema</hi>
    churches were connected to sites with martyria, the cult of
    saints was prevalent throughout Syria and consequently it is
    not really possible to connect only <hi rend="italic">bema</hi> churches with
    martyria or relics (p. 55). For example, many important
    pilgrimage sites were found without a bema, particularly those
    connected to Stylites (p. 56). Rather, she offers the
    possibility that the <hi rend="italic">bema</hi> provided a way to display or
    use a relic during services. Since the bema stood in the same
    place as the pillar of the Stylite in some of the major
    pilgrimage churches (such as at Qal<hi rend="sup">
               <hi rend="italic">c</hi>
            </hi>at
    Sem<hi rend="sup">
               <hi rend="italic">c</hi>
            </hi>an), Loosley suggests that the altar
    that is sometimes found on the <hi rend="italic">bema</hi> might be linked to
    the display or veneration of the relic during the liturgy (pp.
    49-50). This is an extremely interesting idea that deserves
    further consideration, since it has been difficult to explain
    the use of the altar on the bema given the presence of an altar
    in the sanctuary.</p>
         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P6"/>[6] The
    second part of her discussion centers on Castellana�s idea that
    these <hi rend="italic">bema</hi> churches can be connected with a prominent
    member of the community through their proximity to an important
    tomb or nearby villa. (pp. 57-60).� According to Loosley, these
    �are elements that Castellana relates to civil rather than
    ecclesiastical power� (p. 57), suggesting that the bema
    churches were the result of a wealthy or powerful patron.
    Loosley quite rightly points out that we know far more about
    the actual architects of these churches than we do about the
    patrons, citing the extremely important example of Markianos
    Kyris, the man responsible for building a large number of these
    structures. (pp. 60-64). Following this reasoning, she turns
    away from the concept of a secular patron, and considers the
    questions of who would have built these churches and why.� Her
    observation that Markianos Kyris was also a member of a
    religious community (since he was buried in a monastery) (p.
    61) leads into her discussion of the possibility that the
    <hi rend="italic">bema</hi> churches reflect a particular set of religious
    teachings coming from Antioch. These churches were built in
    clusters over the period of three centuries, each group
    probably reflecting the earlier one. She is further able to
    identify these churches as a unique corpus by distinguishing
    these <hi rend="italic">bemata</hi> from the mosaic <hi rend="italic">bemata</hi> found
    further to the west, (pp. 68-70) and the <hi rend="italic">bema</hi> of the
    East Syrian church in Mesopotamia.</p>
         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P7"/>[7] In her
    second chapter, the author turns to the sources that mention
    the <hi rend="italic">bema</hi>. Loosley returns to the discussion started in
    the introduction concerning the proper translation of the term,
    and discusses its presence in Jewish and Manichean sources (pp.
    86-88). She then turns to the Syriac sources, where she
    restricts herself to liturgical commentaries and explanations.
    As well, she restricts herself to unambiguous references to the
    <hi rend="italic">bema</hi> as the large platform in the nave (p. 89). She
    brings to the forefront the issue of the lack of sources in
    either the West or East Syrian traditions. Her discussion
    starts with the earliest sources, including the <hi rend="italic">Didascalia
    Apostolorum</hi>, and concludes with the ninth century East
    Syrian <hi rend="italic">Expositio Officiorum Ecclesiae.</hi>
         </p>
         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P8"/>[8] Earlier
    studies of the liturgy of the bema for both the West and East
    Syrian traditions have relied heavily on interpretation of the
    East Syrian texts, a methodology which does not account for the
    important differences between these groups. Loosley stresses
    this point, and it is an important one (pp. 100-102). While her
    discussion of the later sources is clear, I found her
    discussion of the earliest sources problematic precisely
    because it was not clear. In her discussion of the Syriac
    version of the <hi rend="italic">Didascalia Apostolorum</hi>, for example,
    she talks first about a church layout which places a platform
    at the east end of the church, a liturgical arrangement known
    from Dura Europos (p. 90). She then discusses another passage
    from the same source that clearly uses the word <hi rend="italic">bema,</hi>
    and indicates that the reference �specifically refers to the
    <hi rend="italic">bema</hi> in the centre of the nave.� (p. 90). While the
    Syriac does use the word <hi rend="italic">bema,</hi> the text does not
    clearly indicate its placement within the church.<ref target="#FN5">5</ref> Loosley�s
    interpretation may be correct, but a clearer and more complete
    discussion of the Syriac would have been helpful. This is a
    problem throughout the section on the earliest sources.</p>
         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P9"/>[9] Chapter
    3 moves a step further, and tries to illustrate how the
    <hi rend="italic">bema</hi> was used in the West Syrian liturgy through a
    combination of the textual and archaeological sources. Loosley
    also compares the East and West Syrian traditions in terms of
    the liturgical organization of the <hi rend="italic">bema</hi> and the
    symbolism associated with it. Again, she is quite rightly
    cautious of using the East Syrian sources to assess the West
    Syrian archaeological material. Based on her own archaeological
    evidence and the literary analysis, and Renhart�s
    categorization of the sources concerning the <hi rend="italic">bema</hi>, she
    concludes that �the <hi rend="italic">bema</hi> is always a peripheral
    element in West Syrian texts rather than at the centre of the
    rite.� (p. 128) The fact that the <hi rend="italic">bema</hi> did not always
    play a central role could perhaps have been better connected to
    Loosley�s theory about the liturgical connections of the
    <hi rend="italic">bema</hi> churches with a single school of thought
    emanating from Antioch.�If her theory is correct, this could
    explain why there are few references to the <hi rend="italic">bema</hi> in
    the West Syrian texts, and why it does not retain the mystical
    dimension that it does in the East Syrian texts.</p>
         <p rend="nn">
            <anchor xml:id="P10"/>[10] The
    final chapter is dedicated to summing up the answers that can
    be given—and stating those that still remain. Loosley
    illustrates the importance of associating written and
    archaeological sources, and provides an update on the situation
    of these very important monuments. She provides a list of work
    that still needs to be done on these churches. Loosley quite
    rightly calls for a comparison of East and West Syrian
    architectural styles—and I believe this could be expanded to a
    work much like hers for the <hi rend="italic">bema</hi> (p. 148-149).
    Further, Loosley has initiated discussion on an even bigger
    problem: much more work needs to be done on all of the churches
    of northern Syria, not just those containing
    <hi rend="italic">bemata</hi>.</p>
         <p rend="nn">
            <anchor xml:id="P11"/>[11] The
    remainder of the book is dedicated to three appendices and a
    catalogue of photos from the <hi rend="italic">bema</hi> churches. The
    appendices provide the sources of our information on all of
    these churches; the dates; and the obvious clusters that
    Loosley has identified (pp. 155-163). The photos provide a
    photo essay on both preservation and decay and are an extremely
    important document of what we are losing in this region
    archaeologically (pp. 167-283). However, she has not included
    either a map of the region or any church plans, which often
    makes it difficult to visualize the churches and liturgical
    arrangements she is discussing.</p>
         <p rend="nn">
            <anchor xml:id="P12"/>[12]
    Overall, <hi rend="italic">The Architecture and Liturgy of the Bema in
    Fourth- to Sixth- Century Syrian Churches</hi> is a valuable
    addition to the debate concerning the <hi rend="italic">bema</hi> churches of
    northern Syria. Loosley�s architectural assessment is extremely
    important, and her clear divisions between West and East, and
    even among the West Syrian community should help to restart the
    debate about uniformity in the early Christian world. The need
    to look at both architectural and literary evidence is also
    highlighted by this work.</p>_______<lb/>

                <p xml:lang="en">Divination in Syriac Christianity is a relatively new topic of
                    scholarly inquiry. Despite an abundance of sources, particularly for recent
                        periods,<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn1" n="1"><p rend="footnote text">The
                            later Syriac divinatory tradition focused on astrology and had clear
                            connections with contemporary astrological traditions in Greek and
                            Arabic. The medieval Book of Medicines (<foreign xml:lang="syr">ܣܦܪ

                    syntheses have until now been lacking. The book under review, a masterful study
                    by Jeff Childers centered on a sixth- to seventh-century manuscript of John’s
                    Gospel, British Library Additional MS 17,119—a manuscript that includes a
                    divinatory apparatus, a fact not noted in earlier descriptions—portends an
                    auspicious future for the understanding of divination in the Syriac sphere in
                    late antiquity. Further, as Childers shows, the divinatory apparatus of this
                    manuscript fits within a widespread tradition of oracles attached to the Gospel
                    of John; the oracles are referred to within the texts themselves as
                    “interpretation” (Greek <foreign xml:lang="gr">ἑρμηνεία</foreign>, Syriac ܦܘܫܩܐ,
                    Coptic <foreign xml:lang="cop">ⲉⲣⲙⲏⲛⲓⲁ</foreign>, Armenian <foreign
                        xml:lang="arm">թարգմանութիւն</foreign>, Latin <hi rend="italic"
                        >interpretatio</hi>), implying that they are to be understood as
                    explications of the oracular meaning of Gospel passages. Childers’s study thus
                    contributes to a wider conversation regarding Christian divinatory practices in
                    late antiquity.</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">The book includes a table of contents, eight chapters, and a
                    bibliography. Following the bibliography is an appendix listing the Syriac words
                    that occur in the oracles of BL Add 17,119, which can function as a concordance
                    of these portions of the text. Finally, there are indices of the manuscripts
                    cited, of biblical citations, of ancient authors, and of subjects (including
                    the names of modern authors).</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">The book includes 14 figures showing color photographs of
                    manuscripts, including four images of BL Add 17,119. In addition, many figures
                    in chapter 3 show page layouts of the manuscripts figuring in the discussion.
                    One could wish for more manuscript photographs, especially of BL Add 17,119, but
                    those which are included suffice to give an impression of the script and layout
                    and to allow some of the readings to be checked. Fig. 1.1 on page 2, showing
                    fol. 52v of BL Add 17,119, takes up about three quarters of the available space
                    on the page; were the image enlarged just a bit, it could have approximated the
                    actual size of the leaf, which would have helped to illustrate the comments on
                    page 1 concerning the manuscript’s unusual dimensions.</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">The core of the book is chapter 5, which contains the analysis of
                    the <hi rend="italic">puššāqē</hi> in BL Add 17,119. Each <hi rend="italic"
                        >puššāqā</hi> is transcribed and translated, and parallels for each one are
                    adduced from Greek, Armenian, Coptic, and Latin Divining Gospels (the Peshitta
                    text of the Gospel, which is available from other sources, is not reproduced
                    here). However, the other seven chapters are far from being mere auxiliaries to
                    chapter 5.</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">Chapter 1, “Opening the Gospel,” sets BL Add 17,119 within a
                    context of popular religious practice in late antique Christianity. Childers
                    assembles evidence, including many quotes from church fathers, of the use of
                    John’s Gospel for apotropaic purposes. In addition to the chapter’s independent
                    value as an essay on the culture of religious text artifacts, this
                    contextualization of the Divining Gospel is a significant theoretical step, as
                    I will discuss below.</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">Chapter 2, “Divination in Late Antique Christian Practice,” gives
                    an erudite tour through divinatory practices from the Greco-Roman world through
                    late antique Christianity, ending with a categorization of the various types of
                    Christian divination.</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">Chapter 3 brings together all the diverse manuscript evidence for
                    the tradition of Divining Gospels. Here Childers describes the 20 manuscripts
                    that factor in his study according to four types: (1) manuscripts with segmented
                    layout including passages of Gospel text at the top and oracular
                    “interpretations” underneath (Childers considers this to be the earliest type);
                    (2) manuscripts that integrate the “interpretations” with their associated
                    Gospel readings as a single block of text (BL Add 17,119, the focus of this
                    study, is the sole surviving example of this type); (3) manuscripts that include
                    primarily the Gospel text, with oracular “interpretations” added secondarily in
                    the mar¬gins; and (4) manuscripts that have an uncertain connection to the
                    Divining Gospel tradition, including one fragment (Firenze, Istituto
                    Papirologico “G. Vitelli,” PSI XIII 1364) that contains only oracular material
                    with no extant Gospel readings.</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">Chapter 4 sets up the philological analysis of BL Add 17,119 in
                    chapter 5 by giving a codicological analysis of the manuscript, including a
                    discussion of its provenance.</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">Chapters 6 and 7 attempt to set BL Add 17,119 in the context of
                    late antique Christian divinatory practice, seeking to answer the question how a
                    manuscript such as this would actually have been used. This includes a detailed
                    description of a hypothet¬ical encounter in which the manuscript’s scribe,
                    Gewargis, consults the book through sortilege to obtain an answer for a client
                    (pp. 193–197). If parts of these chapters are speculative, it is nevertheless
                    refreshing to have a theoretical approach to the relationship between book and
                    practice so clearly set forth.</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">Finally, chapter 8 addresses the demise of the tradition of
                    Divining Gospels, a demise heralded by the rules attributed to Jacob of Edessa
                    (d. 708), which rules explicitly forbid monks from providing oracles from the
                    Gospels for clients (or, for that matter, from the Psalms, or from the text
                    known as “Lots of the Apostles”).</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">Childers has made a tremendous achievement in integrating BL Add
                    17,119 and the evidence from Greek, Armenian, Coptic, and Latin manuscripts into
                    a single coherent explication. In effect, he has singlehandedly illuminated late
                    antique Syriac divination as a component of a multicultural Christian
                    tradition. This tradition included an oracular book of Psalms, an oracular
                    Gospel of John (the “Divining Gospel,” of which BL Add 17,119 is an example),
                    and various books of oracles that are distinctly Christian but are not framed as
                    interpretations of scripture. Childers groups all these texts under the rubric
                    of <hi rend="italic">sortilege</hi>, or the casting of lots. In the Divining
                    Gospel, the oracles are numbered, allowing each oracle to be referenced
                    according to a number obtained by casting lots.</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">An example, taken from p. 144, may serve to illustrate how
                    consistent this tradition is. On fol. 65v of BL Add 17,119, after John 17:1–2
                    (the beginning of Jesus’s intercessory prayer, ending with “that he might give
                    eternal life to all whom you have given him”), the following oracle is copied in
                    red ink:</p>
                <p xml:lang="syr">ܦܘܫܩܐ ܡܕܡ ܕܪܓܬ ܗܘ̇ܐ ܠܟ</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">Interpretation: What you desire will be yours.</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">This oracle is numbered 248 in the margin, in red ink like the
                    oracle itself. As Childers shows, parallel oracles belonging to the Divining
                    Gospel tradition are attested in Coptic, Greek, Latin, and Armenian, with minor
                    variation in the verses to which the oracle is attached, the text, and the
                    numbering:</p>

                <p xml:lang="en">This particular example is unusual in that all the known versions
                    of the tradition include this oracle; in most cases, due to the fragmentary
                    condition of the manuscripts, attestations are lacking from one or more
                    versions. The degree of variation from one version to another in this example is
                    typical of the book as a whole. No two versions are identical. The degree of
                    variation is considerable, particularly if one accounts for the variation in the
                    placement and numbering of the oracles. Nevertheless, those familiar with the
                    unrestrained variation characteristic of magical text traditions will be struck
                    with how mutually consistent the texts are. (It should be noted that the
                    idiomatic translation of the Syriac partially obscures its closeness to the
                    parallels: <foreign xml:lang="syr">ܗܘ̇ܐ ܠܟ</foreign>, literally “it will be to
                    you,” or more idiomatically “it will be yours,” could represent a wooden
                    translation of the Greek γιν[εται σοι] “it will hap[pen to you].”) There is no
                    doubt that Childers is correct in treating these examples as witnesses to a
                    single text tradition.</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">The presentation of the texts in this volume also reflects a
                    correct understanding of the nature of the textual tradition. Childers eschews
                    any attempt to reconstruct a standard text or to emend the Syriac version based
                    on the parallels. Thus, rather than presenting a single main text in chapter 5,
                    with the variants relegated to a critical apparatus, he reproduces all the
                    versions of each oracle in parallel. Childers writes the following concerning
                    the nature of the textual tradition (p. 83):</p>
                <cit>
                    <quote xml:lang="en">Whatever the integrity and coherence of this tool’s “first
                        edition” may have been, through copying, translation, and perhaps especially
                        through revision due to usage, subsequent editions and versions evolved in
                        different ways to produce quite a range of different books. We can easily
                        see that they belong together as a set and that they share a common
                        ancestry. But what is true of ancient lot texts generally also applies to
                        the Divining Gospels specifically: “[w]hat we encounter in the transmission
                        of sortes are fluid texts and free, creative lines of textual transmission
                        so that these different lot texts cannot be squeezed into traditional
                        scholarly manuscript stemmata.”</quote>
                </cit>
                <p xml:lang="en">Childers here quotes from a 2019 essay by AnneMarie Luijendijk and

                    a scribal change has occurred, Childers gives a diplomatic reproduction of the
                    parallels and includes a comment in a footnote. For example, on page 111, in the
                    oracle following John 4:10, the Syriac reads <foreign xml:lang="syr">ܐܢ
                        ܡܫܪܝܬ</foreign>, “if you begin,” but the parallels read “if you believe,”
                    suggesting an original Syriac reading <foreign xml:lang="syr">ܐܢ ܡܫܪܬ</foreign>
                    “if you are confident.” Childers gives the reading of BL Add 17,119 (<foreign
                        xml:lang="syr">ܐܢ ܡܫܪܝܬ</foreign>) as the main one and includes a footnote
                    noting the possible emendation and stating that “a small inner Syriac error or
                    revision would account for the difference.” (Note, however, that in the table on
                    page 80, the reading of this passage that is presented includes the emendation:
                        <foreign xml:lang="syr">ܐܢ ܡܫܪܬ</foreign>.)</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">In his theoretical analysis in the introductory and closing
                    chapters, Childers raises some issues that I wish were developed further. The
                    first issue is the relationship between Christian divination and ritual power.
                    This relationship factors in the organization of the introductory chapters and
                    justifies the content of chapter 1. The overall plan of chapters 1 through 4
                    moves from the general to the specific. Childers first discusses the widespread
                    Christian use of scriptural books as objects of power in late antiquity,
                    especially the carrying of copies of the Gospel of John and of amulets inscribed
                    with its opening verses, for protection against malevolent forces, something on
                    which church fathers such as John Chrysostom commented (chapter 1). This
                    establishes the context for a discussion of late antique Christian divination
                    (chapter 2). The discussion then turns to the Divining Gospel tradition as a
                    specific case of Christian divination (chapter 3), and finally to manuscript BL
                    Add 17,119 as an especially complete example of the Divining Gospel tradition
                    (chapter 4). Implicit in this overall plan is the assumption that apotropaic
                    ritual somehow helps to explain text-based divination. More to the point,
                    Chapter 1 is meant to “establish the reasons why late antique Christian editors
                    would choose a biblical codex—and John’s Gospel in particular—to host an
                    extensive divinatory apparatus” (p. 18).</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">Yet the relationship between ritual power and divination is never
                    explicitly elaborated. We do get some hints in chapter 1, such as the following:
                    “As a sacred object, the Holy Bible lent divine potency to such things as
                    prayers for protection or healing as well as to divination—though some parts of
                    the Bible were seen to be more potent than others” (p. 14). Here divination,
                    like texts of protection and healing, is thought to rely on the “divine potency”
                    of the Bible. But it is unclear how this divine potency would be required in the
                    divinatory tradition, which focuses on the text itself rather than on the power
                    of the text artifact as an object.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn3" n="3"><p

                    <quote>Perhaps more than any other Gospel, the Gospel of John, a book of great
                        majesty, mystery, and comfort for many Christians, was seen to embody the
                        presence of the incarnate Christ as the Word of God. People recognized the
                        power of the incarnation not only in John’s teachings and text but even in
                        certain material objects inscribed with John—including codices of the
                        Gospel.</quote>
                    <quote>One way this peculiar reverence for John expressed itself in Late
                        Antiquity is in the production of the Divining Gospel. We have not given
                        much considera¬tion yet to one of the most common expressions of respect for
                        scripture as an agent of divine power and wisdom—the use of the Bible for
                        divination.… Popular reverence for scripture, and John in particular,
                        combined with the abiding interest in divination to produce the Divining
                        Gospels. (pp. 17–18)</quote>
                </cit>
                <p xml:lang="en">Here Childers points to “reverence” or “respect” for John’s Gospel
                    as a motivating factor. But what was it about this Gospel that would make it a
                    suitable vehicle for divination? Childers gets closest to the point when he
                    mentions that this Gospel was “an agent of divine power and wisdom.” This
                    chapter dwells at length on the use of the opening words of John, as well as the
                    use of codices of this Gospel, as agents of power. But he has not established
                    the perception of the text of the Gospel as an agent of wisdom. In the
                    phenomenology of the Divining Gospel tradition, the wisdom hidden in the text
                    seems to be more essential than the power emanating from the text. A Divining
                    Gospel is designed to serve the needs of those in search of answers, and those
                    answers are presented as interpretations of the scriptural text. There is no
                    indication within the Divining Gospel tradition of apotropaic use either of the
                    text or of the object on which it is inscribed. A statement by Ambrose on the
                    mysteries contained in the Gospel of John may be more to the point regarding the
                    divinatory use of this Gospel:</p>
                <cit>
                    <quote xml:lang="en">Yet in the book of the Gospel according to John—John, who
                        with greater clarity than the others saw the great mysteries and recounted
                        and explained them—the intention is to see in the blind man [John 9:1–7]
                        this mystery prefigured. Now all the evangelists are saints, and all the
                        apostles, except the traitor [Judas Iscariot], are saints. Yet it was St.
                        John, the last to write a gospel as the friend sought out and chosen by
                        Christ—he it was who trumpeted forth the eternal mysteries in the clearest
                        tones. Everything he has said is a mystery. </quote>
                </cit>
                <p xml:lang="en">The opening words of John 1, which feature prominently in
                    apotropaic practice, do not seem especially significant in the Divining Gospel
                    tradition. As Childers shows on p. 101, the Syriac <hi rend="italic"
                        >puššāqā</hi> associated with these opening words is wanting, but parallel
                    texts advise passivity: “Leave it, do not be contentious” (Greek); “Withdraw, do
                    not fight” (Latin); “Leave it, do not struggle” (Armenian). In fact, this
                    interpretation may indicate an approach quite different from that of the
                    amuletic tradition. The latter exploits the fact that the prologue of the Gospel
                    of John, to quote Childers, “presumes a backdrop of cosmic conflict and
                    emphasizes the victory of light over its opponent, the darkness” (p. 16).</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">We may tend to link apotropaic and divinatory practices as being
                    similarly “marginal” with respect to official religious practice or as
                    incorporating a “magical” approach to the supernatural, but the texts and
                    vocabulary associated with these practices are nevertheless different, and one
                    may question whether those who engaged in these practices viewed them as
                    mutually explanatory.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn4" n="4"><p

                            these are typically used as pejorative terms, it is still significant
                            that different terms are used for these functions. Moreover, despite the
                            frequent use of scriptural passages in texts of ritual power, the word
                            ܦܘܫܩܐ is not part of the technical vocabulary of these texts, nor do
                            divinatory texts typically use the terms <foreign xml:lang="syr">ܐܣܪܐ</foreign> “binding,” <foreign xml:lang="syr">ܚܪܡܐ</foreign>
                            “anathema,” etc., which feature in texts of ritual power.</p></note></p>
                <p xml:lang="en">A second issue has to do with the concept of text-based divination.
                    Childers uses this term broadly in his discussion of the varieties of divination
                    in chapter 2, including instances in which the text is the medium of
                    transmitting an oracle as well as instances in which the oracle is framed as an
                    interpretation of a preexisting sacred text. On pp. 25–27, a number of different
                    techniques, such as the use of written queries submitted to a deity, the use of
                    tickets containing answers from which the deity would choose, and the use of
                    extensive written collections of oracles accessed by the casting of lots, are
                    grouped together under the heading of text-based divination. On p. 30, Childers
                    uses a more specific definition: “Furthermore, Christianity’s reverence for its
                    sacred texts as the chief authoritative source of that knowledge indicates
                    another point of compatibility, in principle at least, between Christianity and
                    text-based divination, that sought to read the divine will through an
                    examination of the written word.” Here the definition of “text-based
                    divination” is essentially bibliomancy, the interpretation of a written text to
                    divine the future.</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">To be sure, both the broad and the narrow definitions of text-based
                    divination are relevant to the Divining Gospel tradition. The oracles are
                    clearly depicted as “interpretations” of the Gospel text, which seems most
                    closely related to divination based on mystical interpretation of Homer and of
                    Vergil’s <hi rend="italic">Aeneid</hi> (pp. 25–26), while the numbering of the
                    oracles suggests that the lots could be accessed by an external means such as
                    the casting of lots. Childers also raises the possibility that the oracles of
                    the Divining Gospel may derive from a separate collection of written lots, from
                    which source they may have been applied secondarily to the Gospel of John,
                    although he notes that many of the oracles seem adapted to the themes of the
                    Gospel text (p. 84). But a more systematic categorization of the types of
                    text-based divination would help to clarify what the various practices described
                    in chapter 2 have to do with the Divining Gospel.</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">Childers envisions a three-stage development, first “from reliance
                    on conversational oracles tied to specific locations to the use of standard
                    written manuals” (p. 27) and ultimately to “Christian appropriation of
                    text-based divination” in the form of the Divining Gospel tradition (pp. 30–31).
                    He tentatively locates both of these developments in Egypt (pp. 27–28, 31).
                    While the “development from shrine to book was neither uniform nor strictly
                    linear” (p. 27),<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn5" n="5"><p
                        rend="footnote text">Here he cites D. Frankfurter, who writes of the persistence of divina¬tion through procession oracles in Egypt even after the emergence of ticket ora-cles (a practice which Childers loosely classifies with text-based divination).</p></note> Childers maintains that “an increased reliance on [written]
                    texts as vehicles of [oracular] divine communication marks an important
                    development in ancient religion, one that certainly includes the growth in the
                    use of lot divination texts” (p. 27). Yet with the inclusive definition of
                    text-based divination, one is left wondering how this historical development
                    relates to the Divining Gospel. The latter embodies a very specific approach to
                    divination: the notion that God has hidden information about the fortunes of
                    individuals in the scriptural text, so that divination can be a form of
                    scriptural exegesis. Examples of a similar approach are known (such as the
                    oracular use of Homer and Vergil mentioned above), but do we have examples
                    situated in the right time and place to have influenced the Divining Gospel?
                    Moreover, do the Divining Gospel’s closest comparanda help to shed light on the
                    culture surrounding the Divining Gospel tradition? Thus, the more pertinent
                    questions of the cultural history of the Divining Gospel depend on a prioritized
                    treatment of the various types of divination.</p>

                <p xml:lang="en">p. 144, under John 17:1–2: The manuscript (BnF copte 156) reads as

                    around the first ϥ in Crum’s article. Theoretically, the grammar would also
                    permit <foreign xml:lang="cop">ⲡⲉⲧⲕⲉⲡⲓⲑⲩⲙⲓ ⲉⲣⲟϥ ⲛⲁϣⲱⲡⲉ ⲛⲁⲕ</foreign>, but the amount of space presumed to exist on
                    the right side of the fragment, and the somewhat low likelihood of <foreign xml:lang="cop">ⲉⲣⲟϥ</foreign> being
                    broken up between two lines, suggest that Crum’s reconstruction is correct.</p>

                <p xml:lang="en">All in all, Childers’s study is a crucial act in the understanding
                    of late antique Syriac divination within its wider Christian context. The book
                    succeeds on many levels, both as a thorough philological treatment of BL Add
                    17,119 and as a contribution to the cultural history of late antique
                    Christianity. As a clear exposition of a divinatory practice exemplified by
                    manuscript evidence, it has also given us much to follow up on. Even those
                    elements which are speculative or require further elaboration do not detract
                    from the core arguments concerning the character of the Divining Gospel. Future
                    investigations in this book’s domain will do well to give serious attention to
                    its insights.</p>

    Typography, in general, is the art of printing, but it may
    refer more specifically to the craft of typeface design, as it
    does here. Many catalogs and histories of the typography of the
    Latin script have been written, but much rarer are studies of
    non-Western typefaces and typography. J. F. Coakley's <hi rend="italic">The
    Typography of Syriac: A Historical Catalogue of Printing Types,
    1537-1958,</hi> is exceptional both for its subject matter and
    its exhaustive character. It is similar to John H. Bowman's
    <hi rend="italic">Greek Printing Types in Britain</hi> (1998), but where
    Bowman covers just a century and a half of Greek typography
    <ref target="#FN1">1</ref> in
    one region, Coakley treats the entirety of Syriac metal type
    design and usage.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P2"/>[2] Coakley
    is uniquely suited to author this work, due both to his
    affiliation with the Houghton Library in Harvard, with its
    superb manuscript and typographic collection, and as the
    typographer for his own <ref target="http://jericho-press.com/">Jericho Press</ref>, which publishes examples,
    quite unique in our day, of hand-set Syriac type. But it is his
    exhaustive research and passion for the subject that has
    produced such a superlative work.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P3"/>[3] The book
    opens with two prefaces, one for students or typography and the
    other for scholars of Syriac. Addressing syriacists, Coakley
    first expresses a sentiment I expect many have had. "One of the
    reasons I was first attracted to Syriac studies, though I was
    perhaps hardly aware of it then, was aesthetic. The Syriac
    book-hand is one of the most graceful scripts that has ever
    been invented, and simply to be able to read and write it
    oneself was thrilling." While there has been almost nothing
    published by syriacists on this topic before now, he continues,
    "Yet I am sure that most of us do have feelings, conscious or
    sub-conscious, about the script on the page we are looking at,
    and I hope the readers of the present book will find it
    satisfying to inform those feelings with some historical
    information and criticism" (xiii).</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P4"/>[4] An
    introduction provides a very brief history of Syriac printing
    (1-4),<ref target="#FN2">2</ref> followed by a thorough survey of the Syriac
    script in its various forms (4-16) and a discussion of the
    mechanics of designing and producing Syriac metal type (17-24).
    The author then introduces the scheme of his type catalog
    (25-26), which groups together all letterpress Syriac typefaces
    according to script (serto [W], estrangelo [S] and East Syriac
    [E]) and assigns each an alphanumeric designation based on
    script-type and chronological order. Thus the familiar Drugulin
    serto used in Nöldeke's grammar is designated W61, the
    estrangelo used in Overbeck's <hi rend="italic">Opera selecta</hi> is S14,
    etc. This referencing system is convenient and also a practical
    necessity, given the numerous internal references. Following
    the letterpress type catalog is a history of Syriac mechanical
    typesetting, i.e., Linotype and Monotype (251-65), and
    concluding the book is an appendix of "Evidence for types not
    shown" (266-67) and a general index (268-72).</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P5"/>[5] The
    heart of the work, then, is an exhaustive catalog of all known
    letterpress Syriac typefaces (27-250). Each entry his headed by
    an alphanumeric reference, as just described, the name of the
    type designer and/or foundry, and the date when the type was
    struck or when the first example is attested in print. A sample
    of each typeface and any derivative fonts is reproduced
    alongside its history and a description of notable facts and
    features. The author apologizes for presenting his data in
    prose, rather than in the technical and tabular format of most
    catalogs (25n82), but Coakley has produced hereby a highly
    readable narrative work rather than simply a reference
    tool.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P6"/>[6] As
    Coakley says, this books has value for Syriac scholars, apart
    from any inherent interest they may have in typography, by
    informing their aesthetic sense of Syriac typefaces "with some
    historical information and criticism" (xiii). In this digital
    age, when Syriac scholars not only can but at times
    <hi rend="italic">must</hi> be typographers of their own work, having some
    knowledge of "good" or "bad" typeface design, and a historical
    sense of Syriac type usage, is also desirable. In this regard I
    found interesting, for example, the history of "gothic" serto
    scripts.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P7"/>[7] Unlike
    standard Greek and (Roman) Latin typefaces, Syriac typefaces
    were from the beginning modeled on Syriac handwriting. It is
    unusual for Syriac type to be highly stylized in the way Greek
    and Latin typefaces may be. A striking exception is the serto
    type produced by Johannes Richter in 1611, a monolinear and
    eccentric design which strongly departs from handwritten
    Syriac. The design influenced a large number of subsequent,
    predominantly German typefaces which Coakley terms "gothic"
    (49).<ref target="#FN3">3</ref>

    Example of "gothic" serto (W50) from Pius Zingerle's
    <hi rend="italic">Monumenta syriaca</hi> (1869).]</p>Due to its influence,
    Richter's typeface has the distinction of marking "the most
    important step in the degradation of Syriac type-face design in
    Northern Europe down to the nineteenth century" (49). Peter de
    Lagarde was even more pointed: "Kein Syrer hat jemals so
    geschrieben... der verrückteste Syrer in seinen
    verrücktesten Stunden hat es nicht gethan."<ref target="#FN4">4</ref> While many texts
    were printed in this typeface up to the twentieth century, it
    has rightly fallen almost entirely out of use.

            <anchor corresp="P8"/>[8]
    Coakley's book is well edited and nicely produced, typeset by
    the author himself and demonstrating his practical knowledge of
    the craft. One minor desideratum would be to have the typeface
    references (W61, S14, etc.) included in the header of the
    relevant pages, perhaps in square brackets at the inside
    margin, to facilitate the constant cross-referencing the reader
    will certainly do. Otherwise, I only find myself wishing the
    author could have included data he necessarily omits (26),
    namely, a more full listing of the printers and publications
    which employed a particular typeface. Coakley includes many
    such references, and I find this information interesting and
    valuable. To do this comprehensively would fall outside the
    scope of a type catalog, certainly, but this catalog thankfully
    provides future researchers a solid point of departure from
    which to accomplish that task.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P9"/>[9] The
    author rightly titles his work a "Historical Catalogue," and
    this is certainly a historical work of the first order. While
    more purely technical data might be tabulated at some future
    day, or some particular item expanded upon, I cannot imagine
    this work as a whole being superseded. Such a definitive work
    requires exceptional labor. The author remarks, "Both of my
    daughters have been born and have grown up since this project
    was begun" (xv). The author's long and careful labors are
    abundantly evident and have resulted in a benchmark work,
    deserving of our thanks and congratulations.</p>

    monolinear, sans serif, and somewhat geometric. Coakley
    explains alternatively, "'Gothic' suggests what is both North
    European and what is dark and grotesque" (49n65). Gothic types
    are sometimes also called "grotesques," reportedly because,
    when first introduced by 19<hi rend="sup">th</hi>-century advertisers,
    the public was shocked at their spare and non-traditional
    character. <ref target="#FNRef3">

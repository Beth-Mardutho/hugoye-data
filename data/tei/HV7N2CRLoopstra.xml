         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P1"/>[1] On
    Friday, June 25, 2004, a conference convened on the idyllic
    campus of Mount St. Mary�s University to discuss relationships
    between Antiochene exegesis and biblical theology.�The hosts,
    Paul Russell and Robert Miller, successfully organized a
    memorable conference where scholars from a wide variety of
    backgrounds had the opportunity to meet and challenge one
    another.</p>
         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P2"/>[2] After a
    cordial welcome from the Very Reverend Kevin Rhoades, Rector of
    Mount St. Mary�s Seminary, the first session, on Patristic
    exegesis and biblical interpretation, was introduced.�Craig
    Morrison opened up this session with a survey of Aphrahat�s use
    of the Bible in his <hi rend="italic">Demonstrations</hi>.�Sidney Griffith
    showed how the <hi rend="italic">Hymns of Paradise</hi> provide helpful
    insights into Ephrem�s hermeneutical method and profound regard
    for Scripture.�Robert Kitchen argued that in the Book of Steps
    one sees a "laboratory for Antiochene exegesis;" a method not
    quite fully Antiochene, but containing elements of the later
    movement.�He also enticed us with some passages from his
    upcoming English translation of The Book of Steps. The last
    speaker of the Patristic session, Rev. Paul Tarazi, challenged
    us to "hear Scripture" with Chrysostom.</p>
         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P3"/>[3] A brief
    lunch in the Seminary dining hall followed this first session
    allowing participants to socialize informally and to be tempted
    by the all-you-can eat ice-cream buffet.�The second session,
    with a biblical theology focus, was opened by Angela Kim
    Harkins.�Harkins challenged the modern notion that the
    authority of a text is tied to a specific text form.�Instead,
    she argued, recent Dead Sea Scroll research forces us to take
    textual plurality seriously and hence a more transcendent view
    of textual authority; a view, she believes, is similar to that
    of the Antiochene exegetes.�Next, Stephen Ryan examined how
    Syriac exegesis of Psalm 22 might be used to evaluate the
    paradigm of "Method C exegesis" as proposed by Cardinal
    Ratzinger and Gregory Vall. Anthony Salim showed us how the
    living tradition of the Maronite liturgy still engages aspects
    of Antiochene exegesis. The last plenary speaker, John O�Keefe,
    sagely reminded us that later "Antiochene" commentators
    rejected some elements in the work of Diodore and Theodore.�The
    challenge for modern historical theologians, as O�Keefe sees
    it, is to grasp the issues that colored Antiochene
    interpretation and to permit these issues to question some of
    our own presuppositions.�A respondent panel consisting of Paul
    Russell (Historical Theology), Robert Miller II (Historical
    Criticism), and Monsignor Ronald Beshara (Theology) concluded
    the conference.</p>

    their presented paper.�All conference papers are due to be
    published at a later date.</p>

         <head xml:id="S2.1">The Bible in the hands of Aphrahat the Persian
    Sage</head>
         <head>Fr. Craig Morrison, O. Carm., Pontifical Biblical
    Institute</head>
         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P5"/>[5] Fr.
    Morrison�s paper explores two ways Aphrahat, writing in the mid
    fourth-century, approached the biblical text.� Morrison first
    shows how the Syriac term <hi rend="italic">ta<hi rend="u">h</hi>witā</hi>, "demonstration," describes Aphrahat�s
    exegetical method.�A <hi rend="italic">ta<hi rend="u">h</hi>witā</hi> is
    a biblical illustration Aphrahat uses to support his line of
    argument and to demonstrate what a Christian lifestyle looks
    like.�Aphrahat, therefore, "actualizes" the Scriptures for his
    audience by encouraging them to know and to do the
    text.�Second, Morrison reveals subtle connections between
    Aphrahat�s biblical citations and his biblical interpretations;
    connections the Sage�s biblically literate audience would have
    doubtlessly understood.�In the <hi rend="italic">Sixth Demonstration</hi>,
    for example, Aphrahat connects the 2 Kings 2:11 story of
    Elijah�s ascent to the 1 Thess 4:17 image of Pauline
    eschatology by introducing a New Testament term into his Old
    Testament citation.�In so doing, Aphrahat makes Elijah into a
    witness to Paul�s eschatological hope.�Morrison argues that
    Aphrahat�s subtle changes in the wording of biblical citations
    should be evaluated in terms of his biblical interpretation and
    not necessarily as mistakes.�Ultimately, Aphrahat�s work as a
    biblical scholar is characterized by a deep sense of
    humility.�Aphrahat felt that his work was not the last word on
    the interpretation of the Bible.</p>
         <head xml:id="S2.2">Ephrem�s Hymns of Paradise</head>
         <head>Fr. Sidney H. Griffith, S.T., The Catholic University of
    America</head>
         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P6"/>[6] In the
    <hi rend="italic">Hymns of Paradise</hi>, Ephrem speaks more personally about
    his methods and motivations in biblical exegesis than elsewhere
    in his corpus.�Ephrem follows the notion of Paradise from the
    conversation between Jesus and the penitent thief back to the
    beginning of Genesis.�Fr. Griffith points out the varied ways
    Ephrem read types and symbols of Paradise in the Old
    Testament.�Ultimately, for Ephrem, it is Scripture that brought
    him to the gate of Paradise and into the Church, which is
    Paradise restored.�Fr. Griffith emphasizes that Ephrem�s poetic
    exegesis should not be seen as divorced from his prose
    commentaries. The two genres are, rather, mutually
    informative.</p>
         <head xml:id="S2.3">Slouching Towards Antioch: Biblical Exposition in
    the Syriac Book of Steps</head>
         <head>Dr. Robert Kitchen, Knox-Metropolitan United Church,
    Saskatchewan</head>
         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P7"/>[7] The Book
    of Steps (Liber Graduum) is an intentionally anonymous
    collection of 30 <hi rend="italic">mēmrē</hi> on the ascetical life, written
    in the mid-to-late-fourth century probably in the Adiabene
    region inside the Persian Empire.�The unknown author describes
    the character, duties, and disappointments of the two levels of
    Christian life, the Upright (<hi rend="italic">kēnē</hi>) and the Perfect
    (<hi rend="italic">gmīrē</hi>), living during this pre-monastic era in a town
    or village.</p>
         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P8"/>[8] The
    author thinks and writes in Scripture-saturated language,
    preferring longer expositions of Biblical narratives to
    accomplish his construction of the ascetical agenda for his
    community. While the Book of Steps predates the development of
    the so-called Antiochene Biblical exegetical school, its author
    seems prescient of the direction of the Antiochene trajectory,
    especially in remaining faithful to the integrity of the
    Biblical narrative.</p>
         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P9"/>[9] While
    the number of Biblical citations exceed 1200, this study will
    focus on five passages that demonstrate some of the author�s
    strategies of ascetical exegesis.�The Parable of the Wedding
    Feast (Matthew 22:2-13, Luke 14:15-24) and the Parable of the
    Prodigal Son (Luke 15:11-32) both provide the settings for
    typologies of the ascent and arrival of the Perfect one to the
    kingdom of heaven.�The author does not always match the
    Biblical details with his ascetical categories, omitting some
    parts of the parable and in the Prodigal Son adding an
    extra-Biblical conclusion.</p>
         <p rend="nn">
            <anchor xml:id="P10"/>[10] The
    last Biblical passage utilized in the Book of Steps is the
    encounter between Zacchaeus and Jesus (Luke 19:1-10) in the
    30<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
            <hi rend="italic">mēmrā</hi>.�Intent upon justifying the
    righteousness and valor of the lower level, the Upright ones,
    the author rehearses the conversation between Jesus and
    Zacchaeus, adding one word to the canonical text.�"... and half
    of my wealth <hi rend="italic">only</hi> I will give to the poor."�The author
    notes that Jesus did not require him to give up all his
    possessions in order to be saved.�Therefore, neither do the
    worldly Upright ones.</p>
         <p rend="nn">
            <anchor xml:id="P11"/>[11] In
    examining the conundrum regarding humanity�s free will in the
    Hardening of Pharaoh�s Heart (Exodus 5-11), the author does not
    cite directly the texts, but through a close reading determines
    that God did not predestine Pharaoh to a fatal
    stubbornness.�God answered Pharaoh�s prayers for relief from
    the various plagues, but this rendered the latter more arrogant
    once matters returned to normal.�In essence, God killed Pharaoh
    with kindness.</p>
         <p rend="nn">
            <anchor xml:id="P12"/>[12] The
    final passage examined here is the story of Simon�s revelation
    of unclean animals (Acts 10:13-27) which the author uses to
    demonstrate that a mature, Perfect Christian should not be
    afraid of dealing with any manner of sinner or pagan.� In an
    un-Antiochene manner, however, the author reinterprets the
    Lord�s command to Simon, "Kill and eat (these unclean
    animals)," for he knows the apostles did not eat meat at
    all.�Instead, the command is transformed to "seek the company
    of pagans and unclean people and teach them."� This strategy
    appeals to the principle of the difference in times between the
    Biblical world and the contemporary ascetical standards of the
    author, translating the actions so that they are ascetically
    acceptable for the community of the Book of Steps.�Otherwise,
    the author follows the Biblical narrative faithfully with a
    minimum of interpretation.</p>
         <head xml:id="S2.4">Chrysostom on Isaiah: A Paradigm for Hearing
    Scripture</head>
         <head>Very Rev. Paul Nadim Tarazi, St. Vladimir�s Orthodox
    Theological Seminary</head>
         <p rend="nn">
            <anchor xml:id="P13"/>[13] Rev.
    Tarazi suggests that we may become more attentive hearers of
    the biblical text by listening to Scripture with
    Chrysostom.�For Chysostom, the preferred method of divine
    communication (directly through the grace of the Spirit) passed
    away with the apostles only to be renewed in heaven.�Because
    our mind is corrupt, God accommodated himself to mankind in
    Scripture by the use of metaphor.�A proper understanding of
    metaphor is, therefore, essential for the interpreter of
    Scripture.�In his commentaries, Chrysostom sees himself and his
    congregation as the immediate audience of biblical passages
    like the Song of the Vineyard in Ezekiel and the Vision of
    Isaiah.�His listeners are, like ancient Israel, taught to
    listen for what the divine word is speaking to them.�Scripture,
    although written, was meant to be heard as well as read. For
    Chrysostom, every church should listen to what God has spoken
    to other churches regardless of geographical or chronological
    distance.�In his commentaries, Chrysostom reflects the
    importance of reading Scripture back to the community and not
    just to oneself.</p>
         <head xml:id="S2.5">What do Syriac/Antiochene Exegesis and Textual
    Criticism have to do with Theology?</head>
         <head>Dr. Angela Kim Harkins, Duquesne University</head>
         <p rend="nn">
            <anchor xml:id="P14"/>[14] In
    this paper we will look at the pre-modern attitudes towards
    Scripture held by the Antiochene exegetes, specifically the
    Syriac Fathers, to see if, ironically enough, recent
    textual-critical scholarship might be able to bring to light a
    more nuanced understanding of the scriptural text—one that has
    greater continuity with this pre-modern perspective. Pre-modern
    interpreters conceptualized Scripture in a way that recognized
    its divine transcendence while taking seriously its wording or
    textuality, thus paying careful attention to the
    <hi rend="italic">littera</hi> while avoiding the dangers of
    literalism.  Recent textual-critical studies illustrate
    that the Scriptures were textually pluriform in the ancient
    world.  Textual criticism, when applied to the evidence of
    the Dead Sea Scrolls, reintroduces a pre-modern understanding
    of Scripture that holds that the authoritative status of a text
    does not rely upon its specific textual form but rather upon a
    more transcendent understanding of the text itself.  It is
    this attitude towards Scripture that is more consistent with a
    pre-modern understanding and also more open to theological
    inquiry.</p>
         <head xml:id="S2.6">Method C Exegesis and Psalm 22: Contributions
    from the Syriac Tradition</head>
         <head>Fr. Stephen Ryan, OP, Dominican House of Studies</head>
         <p rend="nn">
            <anchor xml:id="P15"/>[15]
    Cardinal Ratzinger and Gregory Vall ("Psalm 22: Vox Christi or
    Israelite Temple Liturgy?" <hi rend="italic">The Thomist</hi> 66 [2002]
    175-200) have used the term "Method C exegesis" to refer to a�
    new, more explicitly theological approach to exegesis that
    would make use of the best insights of the patristic-medieval
    approach ("Method A") and the historical-critical method
    ("Method B"). This paper builds on Vall's 2002 article, and an
    article by Brian Daley, S.J. ("Is Patristic Exegesis Still
    Usable?: Reflections on Early Christian Interpretation of the
    Psalms," <hi rend="italic">Communio</hi> 29 [2002] 185-216), and asks whether
    the Syriac tradition can add anything to Vall's test case
    exegesis of Psalm 22 and Daley's reflections on early Christian
    interpretation of the Psalms. To this end five Syriac
    commentaries on the Psalms are surveyed: Athanasiana
    Syriaca; Daniel of Tella; Ishodad; Denha; and Dionysius bar
    Salibi. (Daniel of Salah's commentary will be included
    in the final written form of the paper). An
    appendix presents a translation of Bar Salibi's three
    commentaries on Psalm 22 in parallel synoptic columns: one
    factual and two spiritual (Syro-Hexapla and Peshitta). Although
    this survey reveals little that is unique, i.e., that cannot be
    found other Christian exegetical traditions, several
    distinctive and important features of the Syriac exegetical
    tradition are identified and discussed and related to the
    articles by Vall and Daley cited above.</p>

    Implications of the <hi rend="italic">
               <hi rend="u">h</hi>oosoyo</hi> in
    Contemporary Maronite Tradition</head>
         <head>Fr. Anthony J. Salim, Maronite Eparchy of Our Lady of

         <p rend="nn">

    <hi rend="italic">
               <hi rend="u">h</hi>oosoyo</hi> in the Maronite liturgy
    consists of an introductory formula outlining the attributes of
    God and a second <hi rend="italic">sedro</hi> entreating God to act on the
    petitions of his Church.�Fr. Salim explains that the term
    <hi rend="italic">
               <hi rend="u">h</hi>oosoyo</hi> comes from the
    translation of the "mercy seat," the lid of the ark of the
    covenant in Exodus 25.�This was where God met with his people
    Israel.�The liturgy interprets Christ as a type of the mercy
    seat; the propitiation for God�s people.�It is for this reason
    that, through the <hi rend="italic">
               <hi rend="u">h</hi>oosoyo</hi>, the
    believer is taught to repeat the petition "through your
    Christ."�Fr. Salim argues that another distinctive feature of
    the Maronite liturgical year is its heavy reliance on Old
    Testament themes as types of New Testament truths.�For example,
    in the Fifth Cycle, Joseph the Carpenter�s dream is interpreted
    in terms of Christological typology.�While pondering how best
    to protect Mary, Joseph finds that trust in God alone is what
    is needed:�"O true and perfect dream come true!"�In the
    <hi rend="italic">
               <hi rend="u">h</hi>oosoyo</hi>, Joseph of Nazareth�s
    dream and its saving ramifications for his family are connected
    typologically with Joseph�s dreams in the Genesis narrative and
    the salvation of the patriarch�s family. Jesus, the bread of
    life, saves the New Testament Christian as the Egyptian grain
    saved the Old Testament faithful.�The <hi rend="italic">
               <hi rend="u">h</hi>oosoyo</hi> sustains ancient traditions of typology
    while nurturing the modern believer in his faith.</p>

         <p rend="nn">
            <anchor xml:id="P17"/>[17]
    According to O�Keefe, modern historical theologians approach
    Antiochene exegesis because they sense the well of the
    historical critical approach is dry.�They want to bring what is
    applicable from past theological method to the present.� As the
    sense of biblical coherence is eroded before their eyes, these
    theologians seek a way to bring together historical truths and
    Christian spirituality.� But for modern scholars, raised in the
    historical critical method, the speculative exegesis of Justin,
    Origen, and others will not suffice. Antiochene exegetes, on
    the other hand, seem to preserve some sense of history in their
    typological exegesis.�O�Keefe argues that the "Church did not
    necessarily err when it recognized problems in some Antiochene
    authors." Theodoret of Cyrus, for example, freely rejected some
    interpretations of his predecessors Diodore and Theodore.�For
    Theodoret both authors had, at times, lost theological
    relevance through their zealous attempts at exegetical
    clarity.�Theologians have largely overlooked the historical
    biases that colored Antiochene readings of the text in their
    efforts to appropriate Antiochene exegesis.�Antiochene
    prolegomena include an implicit trust in the biblical text, a
    strongly anti-Origenistic feeling, and a conviction that
    salvation history is a primary key to scriptural
    interpretation.�While he considers the present fascination with
    Antiochene exegesis on the part of theologians nothing but a
    "hopeful projection," O�Keefe does offer some Patristic
    paradigms that must be taken seriously if the Antiochene
    Fathers are to inform our historical theology.</p>

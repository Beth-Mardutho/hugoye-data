            <div type="text">
                <p>Despite its modest size, the book under review is a major and unprecedented
                    contribution to Syriac studies. It is indeed, as far as this reviewer knows, the
                    first monograph dedicated entirely to the phonology of Classical Syriac. The
                    most detailed descriptions, contained in the grammars of Duval and Nöldeke, were
                    written more than a century ago, and only that of Duval is truly exhaustive.
                    (Oddly, Duval’s grammar is not listed in Knudsen’s bibliography). The monographs
                    previously published by scholars such as T. Weiss and J. Segal covered only
                    selected aspects of the phonological system. Consequently, the publication of
                    this monograph amends this regrettable state of affairs, and author and
                    publisher should be commended for this long-overdue piece of scholarship. </p>
                <p> The book’s layout is trim and elegant. The Syriac fonts, especially the East
                    Syriac and the vowels of Jacob of Edessa, are neat and clean-cut, which makes
                    reading the Syriac particularly pleasant. The book is intended for scholars who
                    are already familiar with the Syriac scripts since transliterations are given
                    only occasionally.</p>
                <p> The book contains eight chapters: preliminaries, features of Early Syriac, two
                    chapters on consonants (consonants, assimilation and dissimilation of
                    consonants), three chapters on vowels (vowels, the auxiliary vowel, vowels and
                    vowel quantity) and one last chapter on stress. Each chapter ends with a useful
                    summary of the main arguments and findings. There are also two appendices on
                    which I shall elaborate below.</p>
                <p> The study follows the methods of historical and structural linguistics. Syriac
                    is compared to Old Aramaic (Aramaic cuneiform incantations from Uruk, Imperial
                    and Official Aramaic), to more or less contemporaneous Aramaic dialects
                    (Palestinian and Babylonian Jewish Aramaic, the Tiberian tradition of Biblical
                    Aramaic), modern Aramaic (Turoyo), as well as more or less contemporaneous forms
                    of Biblical Hebrew (Tiberian Hebrew, Origen’s transcriptions). Attempts to date
                    the various sound changes (spirantization, vowel syncope, change in vowel
                    quality, etc.) are constant. The author always attempts to distinguish the
                    different phases of Syriac (Early Syriac, Early Classical Syriac, West and East
                    Late Classical Syriac). From this point of view, the chapter on the features of
                    Early Syriac is particularly welcome and informative.</p>
                <p> The strength of Knudsen’s study lies, foremost, in its text-oriented approach.
                    In addition to dictionaries, vocalized biblical texts (both manuscripts and
                    printed editions) are systematically employed in the compilation of data. These
                    sources are always clearly distinguished from one another and used to describe
                    with precision the different phases of Syriac and the different textual
                    traditions. (This method calls to mind that of Segal’s <hi rend="italic">The
                        Diacritical Points and Accents in Syriac</hi>.) Certainly, there is little
                    originality in the matters investigated: spirantization of the <hi rend="italic"
                        >bdgkpt</hi>, quality and quantity of the vowels, the auxiliary vowel, etc.,
                    are the traditional issues of Syriac phonology. However, Knudsen’s approach
                    leads to a much finer and more structured description of these processes and
                    their sub-dialectal and textual variants. </p>
                <p> The second strength of the book is the constant reference to the works of
                    medieval Syriac grammarians, mostly Bar Hebraeus and Jacob of Edessa, who
                    discuss phonological phenomena not expressed in orthography. It is only to be
                    regretted that the author did not have the possibility (cf. p. 18, note 2) to
                    include data from important eastern grammarians such as John Bar Zoʿbi.</p>
                <p> The third strength is that phonological rules are always illustrated with
                    copious examples. This is especially true for the fourth chapter on assimilation
                    and dissimilation between consonants: all the distinct cases are presented one
                    by one and illustrated by one or more examples, which makes this chapter the
                    most comprehensive presentation of this subject so far. Also noteworthy are the
                    sections on the vowels of Jacob of Edessa (pp. 92-99), the <hi rend="italic"
                        >e</hi>-vowel symbols in eastern orthography (pp. 103-114), the discussion
                    of <hi rend="italic">ẹ</hi> vs. <hi rend="italic"
                        >e</hi> in Early Syriac (pp.116-133), with eight pages
                    of examples and many observations on the adaptation of Greek sounds which are
                    particularly precise and insightful.</p>
                <p> The book includes two appendices. The first one deals with the traditional
                    pronunciation of Syriac among the Syriac Orthodox. One would have also
                    appreciated information on other traditions, such as Maronite and Assyrian,
                    especially since there is already an article on the Chaldean pronunciation that
                    the author could have used (Hoberman 1997). The second appendix is an
                    interesting sketch of Turoyo phonology. Its inclusion is justified since ancient
                    Aramaic and Turoyo are referenced throughout the book, and since most potential
                    readers probably have a better knowledge of the ancient dialects of Aramaic than
                    of Turoyo.</p>
                <p> Here and there, I find myself in disagreement with Knudsen’s opinions, but will
                    limit myself here to some general comments.</p>
                <p> First, many phonological processes (regular or occasional) are passed over,
                    e.g., <hi rend="italic">e &gt; a</hi> before <hi rend="italic">r</hi> and
                    guttural, aphaeresis of gutturals other than <hi rend="italic">ʿålaf</hi>, <hi
                        rend="italic">e &gt; i </hi>before <hi rend="italic">yy</hi> and sibilant in
                    West Syriac,<hi rend="italic"> ū &gt; ō</hi> before <hi rend="italic">n</hi>,
                        <hi rend="italic">r</hi>, and guttural in East Syriac. The fact that the
                    auxiliary vowel in West Syriac apparently never triggers the spirantization of a
                    following <hi rend="italic">bdgkpt</hi> is not mentioned and should have been
                    explained or even, if necessary, thoroughly documented in vocalized texts, as
                    the author did for the auxiliary vowel in East Syriac. Oddly, the evolution of
                    consonants from proto-Semitic to Syriac is presented, but not that of vowels.
                    Although the development of vowels is possibly more complex, this is not a
                    reason to ignore it completely. Finally, diphthongs, phonotactics, and syllable
                    structure are not presented although they are basic components of any
                    phonological description. (Syllables are employed only occasionally when
                    describing the distribution between long and short vowels and the syncope of
                    short vowels.)</p>
                <p> Second, investigations devoted exclusively to Syriac phonology are rare. It is
                    therefore regrettable that the author has not used, or has not been able to
                    access, some relevant studies, such as Bohas 1988 (on syncope and
                    spirantization), Bohas 1990 (on the shift of proto-Semitic *d̮ to Syriac ʿ and its effect on root
                    structure), Bohas 1999 (on the auxiliary vowel in East Syriac), Edzard 2001 (on
                    syncope and spirantization), Bohas 2005 (on the treatment of the <hi
                        rend="italic">bdgkpt</hi> by John Bar Zoʿbi). Although most of these works
                    are rather technical and theoretically oriented, specialists would certainly
                    have appreciated to know from the author if his own conclusions support, refine,
                    or contradict these preceding studies.</p>
                <p> Third, as in other Semitic languages, many sound changes in Syriac are
                    conditioned both phonologically and morphologically, e.g., <hi rend="italic">a
                        &gt; e</hi> before two consonants in the <hi rend="italic">Pʿal</hi> verbal stem and in some <hi rend="italic">Paʿlå</hi> nouns,
                    monophthongization of the diphthongs in a closed syllable of masculine CvCC
                    nouns, assimilation of <hi rend="italic">n</hi> in I-n roots, <hi rend="italic"
                        >w~y</hi> interchanges in weak roots, sandhi rules of spirantization and
                    vocalization of the <hi rend="italic">bdwl</hi> particles. By treating in most
                    of the cases only phonology <hi rend="italic">stricto sensu</hi>, the author
                    deprives the reader of the descriptions of various and extremely common
                    alternations. To be fair, Knudsen’s book does not aim to be a <hi rend="italic"
                        >Classical Syriac Morphophonemics</hi>. Thus, the grammars of Duval and
                    Nöldeke will still remain indispensable for their coverage of all the Syriac
                    sound patterns. Finally, there is unfortunately no index.</p>
                <p> Despite these minor reservations, the book is an excellent, and the only, update
                    of the body of knowledge on the matters treated. The demonstrations are
                    convincing, the examples abundant, the whole very well structured. By using a
                    text-based approach, Knudsen places his study on scientifically sound footing.
                    The absence of theoretically oriented analyses makes the book accessible to all
                    Syriacisists and Aramaists. Consequently, <hi rend="italic">Classical Syriac
                        Phonology</hi> will be an indispensable working tool for those specializing
                    in Syriac and Aramaic phonology and linguistics, as well as for those concerned
                    more broadly with Semitic phonology and philology.</p>

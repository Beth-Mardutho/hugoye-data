         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P1"/>[1] Azariah
    de' Rossi of Mantua (1511-1577) is best known for his work
    <hi rend="italic">Me'or Enayim</hi> 'Light of the Eyes' (1573), which
    involved a treatment of the origin of the Septuagint. He also
    separately rendered the <hi rend="italic">Letter of Aristeas</hi> into
    Hebrew. In this book, for the first time, are published his
    observations on the Syriac New Testament, written in Ferrara in
    1577 shortly before the author's death. This work was unknown
    to modern scholarship until 1974, when an autograph was
    discovered. Since then another autograph, almost identical to
    the first, has come to light. Weinberg offers an introduction
    to the text (pp. 1-20) and thereafter the printed editio
    princeps giving the Italian text with an English translation on
    the facing page. The page with Italian has footnotes pertaining
    to the text of the work and variations between the two
    manuscripts, while the page with English has footnotes
    commenting on the content of the text.</p>
         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P2"/>[2] This
    work is of interest from a number of points of view. Its period
    of composition, the sixteenth century, was of course one of
    considerable ecclesiastical debate about the most authoritative
    text of the Bible and about the nature of the Vulgate. This
    text shows a Jew engaging with this debate between Christians.
    That he was writing for a Christian audience also explains the
    choice of Italian rather than Hebrew as the language of
    composition.</p>
         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P3"/>[3] The
    immediate context for the work was the publication of the first
    edition of the Syriac New Testament by J.A. Widmanstadt in
    1555, of the second edition by I. Tremellius in 1569, and of
    the reprint of Widmanstadt's text with further manuscript
    evidence in the Antwerp Polyglot (1571). Thus the work was
    produced at a time when the nature of the Syriac New Testament
    text was an important question. De' Rossi offered the work to
    Giacomo Boncompagni (Governor General of the Church and son of
    future Pope Gregory XIII) and Cardinal Santa Severina (Giulio
    Antonio Santoro, 1532-1602).</p>
         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P4"/>[4] The
    basic argument of the work was that 'certain passages in the
    New Testament, particularly the Aramaic expressions, ought to
    be emended on the basis of the ancient Syriac rendering' (p.
    4). The work considers various texts, including Matthew 3:17;
    5:22; 6:24; 16:17; 23:5; 27:6, 33, 46; Mark 3:17; 5:41;
    7:11-12; 34-35; 15:34; John 1:42-43; 12:28; 19:13-14, 20-22;
    Acts 1:19; 7:14-16; 9:40; 13:17-22; 1 Cor. 16:22. Luke's Gospel
    receives no special analysis.</p>

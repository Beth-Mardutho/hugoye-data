                <p xml:lang="en">Nearly a century after the publication of the first edition and
                    Latin translation of the Syriac <hi rend="italic">Book of Steps</hi> (hereafter <hi rend="italic">BoS</hi>) in the Patrologia
                    Syriaca series, this corpus remains understudied and undervalued as a witness to
                    the diversity of Christian belief and practice in the historical study of late
                    ancient Christianity. Indeed, it is difficult to incorporate the <hi rend="italic">BoS</hi> because of
                    uncertainties surrounding its historical context, and the relative lack of
                    attention may be due to the fact that the complete corpus was only recently
                    published in English translation for the first time.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn1" n="1">
                        <p rend="footnote text">Robert A. Kitchen and Maartien
                            F. G. Parmentier, <hi rend="italic">The Book of Steps: The Syriac Liber

                    </note> However, it is also likely that these
                    texts have been largely ignored in broad, synthetic treatments of late ancient
                    Christianity because of the pervasive scholarly narratives that have accompanied
                    the corpus ever since its publication. Such narratives give the impression that
                    the corpus has been correctly “identified” (as part of the Messalian
                    controversy) with the result that the <hi rend="italic">BoS</hi> is regarded as anciliary to the study
                    of “mainstream” late ancient Christianity. The paucity of critical studies of
                    the ideas and practices witnessed by the <hi rend="italic">BoS</hi> makes the present volume a welcome
                    addition to the bibliography, not only of scholarship on the <hi rend="italic">BoS</hi> or early Syriac
                    Christianity, but more broadly on the history of late ancient Christianity and
                    religions of the ancient Mediterranean.</p>
                <p>This volume, which represents a collection of papers solicited generally by the
                    editors and delivered at two different conferences, offers both critical
                    examinations of significant aspects of the contents of the <hi rend="italic">BoS</hi>, many of which
                    have been neglected or overlooked in previous treatments, and several
                    challenging new directions for future scholarship. The sixteen chapters (aside
                    from Preface and Introduction) are organized into five parts: 1) The World
                    Around the <hi rend="italic">BoS</hi>, 2) The Text, 3) Biblical Exegesis, 4) Theological Perspectives,
                    and 5) Practices of Asceticism. </p>
                <p>The overarching theme of Part 1 is contextualization, as the first three chapters
                    seek to situate the social, political, and religious context(s) for the author
                    and community of the <hi rend="italic">BoS</hi>. In Chapter 1 (“The Romano-Persian Border and the
                    Context of the Book of Steps”), Geoffrey Greatrex offers a succinct summary of
                    Roman-Persian relations from the last quarter of the 3rd century to the end of
                    the 4th century with particular attention to how the interactions of these
                    imperial regimes affected Christians in the Persian Empire. There is little new
                    information in this chapter, but it does offer a helpful condensed narrative of
                    events that could otherwise only be pieced together from multiple sources.
                    Whereas the first chapter is primarily concerned with the political history of
                    the 4th century, chapters 2 and 3 deal with comparisons between the <hi rend="italic">BoS</hi> and
                    other religious communities and practices. Timothy Pettipiece (“Parallel Paths:
                    Tracing Manichaean Footsteps Along the Syriac Book of Steps”) draws some
                    cautious conclusions about links between the community described in the <hi rend="italic">BoS</hi> and
                    Manichaeans. Namely, Pettipiece argues that the bifurcated communal structure of
                    Upright/Perfect resembles the Hearers/Elect structure of the Manichaeans and
                    notes some literary parallels between the <hi rend="italic">BoS</hi> and the Manichaean Kephalaia.
                    Pettipiece rightly urges caution regarding making too much of these connections,
                    resisting the pitfall of arguing for direct relationships. Indeed, adding to
                    this caution, it seems that the future of any such comparative analysis must
                    begin with an examination of essentialist categories of “Christian” and
                    “Manichaean” identities in the 3rd and 4th centuries. The third and final
                    chapter of this section, written by Martien Parmentier (“The Book of Steps on
                    Magic”), offers a brief analysis of how “magic” functions in the <hi rend="italic">BoS</hi>. Parmentier
                    begins with references in Greek literature to Syriac as a “magical” language and
                    then considers the way that the <hi rend="italic">BoS</hi> constructs Christian miracles in distinction
                    from “magic.” Further treatments of this topic would benefit from a clear,
                    analytical definition of “magic,” more emphasis on the discursive nature of
                    Christian rhetoric about magic, and a deeper contextualization of magic in
                    Syriac sources against the background of the vast corpus of Aramaic magical
                    texts. </p>
                <p>The two chapters in Part 2 (“The Text”) highlight some of the most pressing
                    desiderata in future analyses of these texts. First, Grigory Kessel (“A
                    Previously Unknown Reattributed Fragment from Memra 16 of the Book of Steps”)
                    offers an overview of the textual history of the <hi rend="italic">BoS</hi> and notes that the future
                    of textual discoveries for corpora like the <hi rend="italic">BoS</hi> lies (most likely) in the
                    discovery of unattributed fragments that are extracted and repurposed in
                    monastic miscellany manuscripts. Further, Kessel provides an example of
                    precisely such a previously unknown fragment from Memra 16, which circulated
                    either anonymously or under the name of Mar Thomas. Kessel found this fragment
                    attested in eight manuscripts, ranging from the 13th to 18th century, and the
                    chapter concludes with a critical edition of the fragment. Hopefully, further
                    analysis of the transmission history of the <hi rend="italic">BoS</hi> will shed light not only on its
                    reception history, but its origins as well. On the topic of origins, it has long
                    been assumed that the <hi rend="italic">BoS</hi> is a corpus dating from the 4th century or early 5th
                    century. Kyle Smith (“A Last Disciple of the Apostles: The ‘Editor’s’ Preface,
                    Rabbula’s Rules, and the Date of the Book of Steps”) challenges this consensus
                    position by interrogating the historiographic assumptions that undergird this
                    dating. There are two narratives in particular that Smith challenges: the
                    identification of the Messalian controversy as the proper context for
                    understanding the <hi rend="italic">BoS</hi> and the use of ‘proto-monastic’ language that appears so
                    often as a descriptor of the <hi rend="italic">BoS</hi> community (indeed, this term appears many times
                    even in this volume). Smith grants that the traditional dating of the <hi rend="italic">BoS</hi> rests
                    upon a plausible interpretation of the available historical data, but, as he
                    argues compellingly, it is not the only plausible interpretation. Rather than a
                    response to a 4th-century crisis, Smith reads the <hi rend="italic">BoS</hi> as a response to a
                    different crisis in the 5th century, namely the imposition of regulations upon
                    monastic communities by none other than Rabbula of Edessa. As a key part of the
                    argument, Smith also postulates that the “Preface” that accompanies the corpus
                    in some of the manuscript witnesses was not, in fact, written by a later editor,
                    but represents a composition by the author himself and that this understanding
                    of the introduction should re-frame the way we understand its relationship to
                    the corpus. Even if one does not accept Smith’s full argument, there can be no
                    doubt that he has offered a significant challenge to the dating of this corpus,
                    and this challenge cannot be ignored in future discussions of the context of the
                    <hi rend="italic">BoS</hi>. </p>
                <p>The third part of the book, devoted to Biblical Exegesis, contains two chapters.
                    The first chapter (“Biblical Exegesis in the Syriac Book of Steps: A Preliminary
                    Survey”), by René Roux, contains a broad overview of the ways that the author of
                    the <hi rend="italic">BoS</hi> interprets Scripture. One interesting aspect that Roux elucidates is the
                    author’s strategy of interpretation that seeks to remove apparent contradictions
                    in the commandments of the Bible. Roux also clearly shows the ways that the
                    author exegetes the “precepts” and the “examples” found in Scripture. In the
                    second chapter of this section, Matthias Westerhoff (“Did the Author of the Book
                    of Steps Understand Paul?”) demonstrates that the use of Paul is somewhat more
                    complicated than one might expect: Paul is clearly the hermeneutical lens
                    through which the author of the <hi rend="italic">BoS</hi> understands the central message of the
                    Gospel, but the author also feels free to disagree with Paul and creatively
                    interpret Paul’s words for his own purposes. </p>
                <p>The four chapters that comprise the Theological Perspectives section (Part 4) are
                    quite different from one another in approach and method. In Chapter 8 (“A Broken
                    Mind: The Path to Knowledge in the Book of Steps”), J. W. Childers puts the
                    author of the <hi rend="italic">BoS</hi> in conversation with modern virtue ethicists and argues that
                    the <hi rend="italic">BoS</hi> demonstrates a clear correlation between virtue and the acquisition of
                    knowledge. Childers’s guiding principle throughout this argument, as the title
                    of the chapter suggests, is that the phrase “breaking the mind” in the <hi rend="italic">BoS</hi>
                    refers to the act of humbling oneself for ethical instruction and moral
                    formation. In the following chapter, Pablo Argárate (“The Perfect and Perfection
                    in the Book of Steps”) analyzes the concept of “perfection”. This is an
                    intriguing topic and Argárate makes interesting observations, but the treatment
                    here could have benefitted from a more analytical approach and clearer thesis.
                    In her chapter, Kelli E. Bryant (“You Are What You Eat: Dietary Metaphors in the
                    Syriac Book of Steps”) approaches the corpus by analyzing eating metaphors that
                    the author uses to describe the moral and ascetic formation of the community.
                    When reading the corpus, it is easy to overlook this metaphor, but having read
                    Bryant’s analysis, it is now difficult to overestimate how central this concept
                    is to the author’s rhetorical approach. Bryant notes the clear biblical
                    allusions that the author relies on to construct the dietary metaphors of
                    “milk,” “vegetables,” and “solid food,” but also clearly demonstrates the ways
                    that the author employs these metaphors to distinguish the “diets” of the
                    Upright and the Perfect. Tera Stidham Harmon authors the final chapter of this
                    section (“Falling from the Path of Perfection: Sin in the Syriac Book of
                    Steps”). Harmon explores the place of sin in the ascetic system of the <hi rend="italic">BoS</hi>.
                    Although sin may seem like a rather obvious theme that would emerge in such a
                    work, Harmon shows that the communal effort to overcome sin through the
                    imitation of Christ is a central aspect of the community’s organization; indeed,
                    it is what binds the Upright and Perfect together in their pursuit of holiness. </p>
                <p>The fifth and final part of the book is devoted to Practices of Asceticism. Given
                    the significance of the <hi rend="italic">BoS</hi> in the history of Syrian asceticism, it is no
                    surprise that, with five chapters, this is the largest section of the book. In
                    the opening chapter (“Disturbed Sinners: In Pursuit of Sanctity in the Book of
                    Steps”), Robert A. Kitchen examines the concept of “holiness” in the <hi rend="italic">BoS</hi> by
                    considering modern definitions of this term. The title of this chapter is
                    derived from a quote from Karl Barth, the primary modern author that Kitchen
                    uses for theological framework. Although the concept of “holiness” in the <hi rend="italic">BoS</hi>,
                    strictly speaking, refers to virginity, Kitchen broadens the definition in
                    search of the virtues that one must pursue in order to remain on the steep path
                    toward perfection. Sergey Minov (“Marriage and Sexuality in the Book of Steps:
                    From Encratism to Orthodoxy”) provides a thorough examination of the author’s
                    treatment of sex as a result of the fall and thus marriage as a concession to
                    human weakness. Minov carefully demonstrates how central and unusual the
                    author’s exegesis of Gen. 1-3 is on this topic, but also ties it into broader
                    discussions of sexuality and virginity in late ancient Christianity by comparing
                    the <hi rend="italic">BoS</hi> with encratism and differentiating the author of the <hi rend="italic">BoS</hi> from Aphrahat
                    and Ephrem. </p>
                <p>The primary concern of Thomas Kollamparampil’s chapter (“‘Hidden Work’ of the
                    Heart and Spiritual Progression in the Book of Steps”) is an overview of
                    spirituality in the <hi rend="italic">BoS</hi> and the practices that the author advocates for the path
                    of spiritual progression. In the penultimate chapter of the volume, Aryeh Kofsky
                    and Serge Ruzer provide a close reading of Memra 21, highlighting the author’s
                    exegetical and hermeneutical strategies for constructing his ascetic system.
                    Kofsky and Ruzer show conclusively that the author of the <hi rend="italic">BoS</hi> is a creative and
                    independent exegete who employs multiple styles of interpretation to suit his
                    purposes. Finally, Jason Scully (“Lowering in Order to be Raised, Emptying in
                    Order to be Filled: The Ascetical System of the Book of Steps”) places the
                    ascetic framework of the <hi rend="italic">BoS</hi> in a broader context by comparing its essential
                    features (e.g., humility leading to spiritual progression) with other ascetic
                    literature of early Christianity. For Scully, the <hi rend="italic">BoS</hi> is not dependent upon
                    other ascetic literary traditions, but these similarities should not be
                    overlooked when contextualizing the early Syriac monastic tradition. </p>
                <p>As any edited volume should, this book significantly expands the scholarly
                    investigation of a particular topic. Indeed, this volume pushes the study of the
                    <hi rend="italic">BoS</hi> forward in a number of ways. Likewise, this volume leaves a number of open
                    questions awaiting more definitive treatment. Considering the volume as a whole,
                    there are a few important themes that emerge and stand now as the most pressing
                    concerns for any future scholarship on the <hi rend="italic">BoS</hi>. The first and most obvious theme
                    is the precise time and context for the production of this corpus. While the 4th
                    century remains the consensus, Smith has provided a compelling case for
                    reassessing this conclusion. Many chapters take it for granted that the <hi rend="italic">BoS</hi> is a
                    product of the 4th century and thus best contextualized by comparison with
                    Aphrahat and Ephrem; however, this presumption can no longer be taken for
                    granted. On a similar note, the multiple assessments of asceticism in this
                    volume should provide a significant challenge to the language of
                    “proto-monasticism” that is so often associated with this corpus. The very idea
                    of “proto-monasticism” conveys ideological assumptions that must also be
                    re-examined and re-framed. Finally, a theme running beneath the surface of
                    several essays that offers a significant path forward is the necessity for
                    incorporating these ascetical homilies into the field of late antique
                    Christianity more broadly. These texts have long been ignored or sidelined, but
                    hopefully, the quality of these contributions will demonstrate the significance
                    of the <hi rend="italic">BoS</hi> and allow it to have a broader audience. </p>

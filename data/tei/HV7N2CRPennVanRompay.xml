            <anchor corresp="P1"/>[1] From
    June 14th to July 23rd 2004, Duke University hosted a National
    Endowment for the Humanities summer seminar entitled
    “Aramaic in Post-Biblical Judaism and Early
    Christianity.” This seminar gave fifteen scholars the
    opportunity to broaden and deepen their knowledge of Aramaic
    and to discuss major developments in recent Aramaic
    scholarship. Eric M. Meyers (Duke University) and Paul V.M.
    Flesher (University of Wyoming) co-directed the seminar. Lucas
    Van Rompay (Duke University) served as the third principal
    instructor. Guest seminar leaders and lecturers included
    Douglas M. Gropp (Catholic University of America, Washington,
    DC), George A. Kiraz (Beth Mardutho), Hayim Lapin (University
    of Maryland), Christine C. Shepardson (University of Tennessee,
    Knoxville), and Michael Sokoloff (Bar Ilan University).</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P2"/>[2] The
    seminar focused on three different literary languages: literary
    Aramaic of the post-Achaemenid period (including Qumran Aramaic
    and the language of the earliest Jewish translations of the
    Bible), Jewish Palestinian Aramaic, and Syriac. In addition to
    morning language training and reading sessions, evening
    seminars and lectures addressed several topics of broader
    literary and historical interest. The fifteen participants also
    worked on individual research projects in consultation with the
    three senior scholars. In the final week of the seminar, the
    participants presented interim reports of their research
    projects. A volume appearing in 2005 will publish final
    versions of these projects.</p>

    following list of presentation titles suggests, the
    participants’ research reflected a diversity of
    backgrounds and interests.</p>

         </list>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P4"/>[4] For many
    participants the seminar offered a rare opportunity to interact
    with other students and scholars of Aramaic and to read and
    discuss texts collaboratively. Because the academic study of
    early literary Aramaic, Jewish Palestinian Aramaic, and Syriac
    tends to develop into separate disciplines, the seminar served
    a particularly important role in emphasizing the
    interconnectedness of the various Aramaic traditions and
    highlighting the necessity for students of any specific branch
    of Aramaic to be aware of scholarship in other fields of
    Aramaic studies.</p>

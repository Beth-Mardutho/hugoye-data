    Twentieth century Syriac literature witnessed a few
    translations from western languages into modern literary
    Syriac, and none on a subject matter relating to Syriac studies
    itself. Brock's The Bible in the Syriac Tradition (BST), the
    subject matter of this paper, was the first such translation.
    Understanding the translation methodology and techniques behind
    it may pave the way for a new trend and a new genre in modern
    Syriac literary production.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P2"/>[2] The
    paper will start by outlining the challenges that face the
    modern translator. It will then examine the translation
    methodology and techniques employed. The various potential
    methodologies and styles that were under consideration (e.g.,
    literal vs. free, native coinage vs. borrowings, etc.) will be
    discussed, and the choices made will be argued for in order to
    achieve a comprehensible reader-oriented modern translation. A
    mini lexicon of neologisms, calques and technical vocabulary
    will be given, along with the process of how they were
    derived.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P3"/>[3] Finally,
    the paper will draw a comparison between the challenges and
    translation techniques used for this work, and those employed
    by the old translators of the Syriac scriptures, relating the
    challenges of modern day translations to those of the past.</p>

    Museum</head>
         <head xml:id="HV7N1IVSyriacSymAbstracts5">Jennifer Ball, Program in Hellenic Studies, Princeton
    University</head>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P4"/>[4] An
    important Syrian liturgical stole, known as a
    <hi rend="italic">batrashil</hi>, in the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s
    Islamic collection has recently come to scholars’
    attention after many decades in storage. The 55-inch long,
    silk embroidered stole is a unique surviving example of an
    Islamic era ecclesiastical vestment from Hamah, Syria,
    according to its inscription. Inscribed in both Arabic and
    Syriac, we know that it was made in 1534/5 CE by a woman
    artist; it is rare enough that a maker’s name survives
    let alone that of a woman, who identified herself in
    Arabic. The stole, worn by a bishop, is luxuriously
    decorated with scenes from the life of Christ in addition to
    portraits of the Evangelists, all identified in Syriac. The
    colorful scenes are thickly embroidered in silk with some
    metallic threads on a blue background all of which remains in
    remarkably good condition, which also adds to the exceptional
    nature of this object. This paper will discuss the art
    historical context of the stole among vestments of the
    Byzantine, Coptic and Nubian churches, to which it most closely
    relates. Additionally, the object will be understood
    within the context of sixteenth-century Syria.</p>
         <head xml:id="HV7N1IVSyriacSymAbstracts6">Devotional Study: The School of Nisibis within
    East-Syrian Monasticism</head>
         <head xml:id="HV7N1IVSyriacSymAbstracts7">Adam H. Becker, New York University</head>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P5"/>[5] The
    School of Nisibis was the major intellectual center of the
    Church of the East in the sixth and early seventh centuries as
    well as an institution of learning unprecedented in antiquity.
    In this paper I will attempt to fit the School of Nisibis and
    East-Syrian school movement as whole into the broader spectrum
    of East-Syrian monasticism. Instead of seeing monasteries and
    schools as wholly different and distinct institutions, I will
    argue that the difference between the School of Nisibis and
    East-Syrian “reform” monasteries was their notions
    of epistemology, the accessibility of the divine, and the
    importance of the social interaction. Furthermore, I will
    suggest that a homologous relationship exists between the
    intellectual and social life that each of these institutions
    advocates. In sum, group study at the school serves as a
    devotional practice with as much religious significance as
    prayer and private reading in a more Evagrius-inspired
    institution.</p>

    Isho‛ Kamulaya and his book on monastic life are
    mentioned in the Syriac catalog of the library of
    ‛Abdisho‛ bar Berikha (d.1318). Until recently,
    however, little was known about the writings and the life of
    this distinctively-named East Syrian monk who seems to have
    flourished in the late eighth century.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P7"/>[7] The
    works of Beh Isho‛ have survived in two Syriac
    manuscripts. They are incomplete in a manuscript at The
    Catholic University of America (ICOR Syriac MS 18), tentatively
    dated to the late ninth or tenth centuries on paleographic
    grounds. They also appear in a modern codex, Trichur MS 16,
    copied in 1900 by a member of the Kellayta family of copyists
    and clerics for Abimelek Bar-M’naha, who later became
    Metropolitan Timotheos Abimelek of Trichur. It is now in the
    library of the Metropolitan see of the Church of the East, in
    Trichur, Kerala, India.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P8"/>[8] The
    works include six discourses (<hi rend="italic">mêmrê</hi>) on
    the monastic way of life, a collection of “Chapters of
    Knowledge” (<hi rend="italic">rišê
    d’īdātâ</hi>), and a poem
    (<hi rend="italic">madrāsâ</hi>). The Trichur codex also contains
    a biography, which turns out to be a reworking of the Syriac
    Life of Abba Bishoi, one of the legendary founders of the
    monasteries of the Egyptian Wadi Natrum.</p>

    Ephrem the Syrian’s use of the doctrine of Christ’s
    descent to Sheol has long been noted as an integral component
    of his soteriological thought, representing the fulfillment of
    the incarnate Son’s identification with humanity and his
    restoration of humanity to its intended end of communion with
    God. Ephrem articulated the theological significance of
    Christ’s descent to Sheol by means of comparison to
    several events in Christ’s earthly life and
    ministry. The narrative of Christ’s temptation in
    the wilderness played a recurring role in Ephrem’s
    explication of the meaning of Christ’s descent to Sheol,
    relating it not only to the eschatological resurrection, but to
    the life of the Church in the temporal world.</p>

    “Clothed” in and possessed of the same human
    freewill as fallen Adam, Christ was susceptible to temptation
    and to death and therefore able to contend against Satan in the
    wilderness and Death in Sheol.  Victorious over both of
    these “eaters of humanity,” Christ the Second Adam
    opened the possibility for his Church to be
    “clothed” in his glory and participate in his
    conquest of the Evil One “here” and Death
    “hereafter” (CN 58.25).  Furthermore, because
    of the complementarity of Christ’s victories over Satan
    and Death, strict distinctions between ordinary and sacred time
    with reference to human salvation have been collapsed, allowing
    Christians to participate in the temporal in the light of the
    eternal and in the eternal by means of the temporal.</p>

    describe an implemented method for the recognition of Syriac
    handwriting from historical manuscripts. The Syriac language
    has been a neglected area for handwriting recognition research,
    yet is interesting because the preponderance of scribe-written
    manuscripts offers a challenging yet tractable medium for OCR
    research between the extremes of typewritten text and free
    handwriting. Like Arabic, Syriac is written in a cursive form
    from right-to-left, and letter shape depends on the position
    within the word. The method described here does not need
    to find strokes or contours of the characters. First, words are
    segmented into character shapes using a novel non-parametric
    probability density estimator. Next, features are found using a
    novel generalized moment generating function. Each shape is
    recognized individually using a discriminative support vector
    machine with 10-fold cross-validation. We describe experiments
    using a variety of segmentation methods and combinations of
    features. Images from scribe-written historical manuscripts are
    used, and the recognition results are compared with those for
    images taken from clearer 19th century typeset documents. A
    recognition rate of 98% is achieved for the typeset source and
    94% for the ancient manuscript source.</p>

    Churches with two parallel naves and two apses facing east were

    painted churches, eight of them had two parallel naves and two
    apses. This is a substantial proportion, and this number
    does not include many churches still standing that are no

    manuscript depository in the “Syrian Monastery” in

    and the Syrians from Coptic documents. Thus, the relationship
    between the two churches will be expressed from the Coptic
    perspective. This will not include modern relations that
    can be easily found among the minutes of meetings, in print
    readily available. The points of discussion will be the

    resided as Patriarchs of the Coptic Church and the liturgical
    and devotional changes that followed such an
    exchange. After the Arab conquest of both churches, they
    shared a common language, i.e. Arabic. This led to an
    exchange of theological terms. The power of the exchange
    of language and hagiographic stories of saints strengthened the
    relations among the two churches beyond ecclesial
    politics. This presentation discusses a relation that has
    been strengthened, beyond the common theological agreement, by

    Recent scholarship suggests some fresh considerations relevant
    to the enigmatic ancient Syriac office of the Daughters of the
    Covenant, about which we know even less than we do for its male
    counterpart, the Sons of the Covenant. I would like to reassess
    our understanding of the Daughters of the Covenant, with
    particular attention to the question of women's liturgical
    participation. Liturgical chanting was one of the
    canonically prescribed activities of the Daughters of the
    Covenant (e.g, Rabbula Canons, 20). Indeed, late antique and
    medieval primary sources often refer to the women's choirs of
    the Syriac civic churches as comprised of, or partially
    inclusive of, or led by Daughters of the Covenant. The
    presence of women's choirs in the Syriac civic churches was in
    fact a contested matter, and stood in contrast to the normal
    pattern of Greek civic churches. Recent studies on the
    ancient Greek traditions of women's singing, performative
    roles, and public voices have raised a number of issues
    critical to assessing the presence or absence of women's choirs
    or female chanters in late antique churches. This material
    bears upon the practices of the Syriac churches in significant
    ways, I will argue, and offers important insights to our
    understanding of the Daughters of the Covenant as members of a
    public office.</p>

    of both the east and west were social experiments. They were
    both influenced by their contextual cultures and they
    influenced the dominant cultures that followed them. 
    Today Syriac Christianity stands at a crossroad. Western
    culture, in part formed by Benedictine monastic social rules,
    now dominates the Syriac Christian diaspora. Clues to its
    survival may lie in the canons of social organization in early
    Syriac monastic Christianity.</p>

    Liturgical calendars provide a quotidian guide for the Syriac
    Orthodox faithful in the practice of spiritual life in the
    Church all through the year, setting apart days for
    commemorating principal events in the salvation history of man,
    specifying periods of fasting, and marking the feast days of
    saints, memorial days of the fathers, and local observances.
    Lectionaries prescribe scripture readings for the liturgical
    offices of holy days through out the calendar year. Liturgical
    calendars and lectionaries have been in use for many centuries
    and since the advent of printing have come into wide use among
    the laity.</p>

    Through the ages, such calendars have been compiled through a
    tedious manual process. This paper describes the automated
    generation of the liturgical calendar for a given Gregorian
    year. The calendar includes scripture readings for the
    principal feast days from the lectionary. The date of Easter
    and related movable feasts can be based on the Julian or
    Gregorian calendar as required by the Syriac Orthodox practice
    in the Middle East and Malankara (India) respectively.</p>

    The same XML file can be transformed to produce a lectionary

            <anchor corresp="P41"/>[41] In
    his <hi rend="italic">Hymns on Fasting</hi>, Ephrem the Syrian provides a
    framework for reading the tales of <hi rend="italic">Daniel</hi>
    1-6. His reading makes a number of assumptions about
    Daniel and his three companions, however, that go beyond the
    information explicitly provided in the biblical text. For
    example, he calls them “fasters” in episodes where
    Daniel and his companions are not described as fasting
    (<hi rend="italic">Ieiun.</hi> 4.9; cf. <hi rend="italic">Dan.</hi> 3). Ephrem also
    describes the social dynamics of their situations more
    emphatically than does the biblical text. For example, he
    names “envy” as the motivation of the
    Judeans’ opponents (<hi rend="italic">Ieiun.</hi> 7.7).</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P42"/>[42]
    These conclusions that Ephrem draws from the biblical
    narratives are the result, I submit, of the influence of
    Ephrem’s own social and cultural context. Biblical
    scholars using social-scientific criticism have developed tools
    to help interpreters recognize the influence of social and
    cultural contexts on the production and reading of ancient
    texts. Valuable here are models by which to understand the
    dynamics at work in a society whose central cultural value is
    honor. Reading Ephrem’s understanding of the tales
    in <hi rend="italic">Daniel</hi> 1-6 with attention to these models allows us
    to make sense of Ephrem’s use of “honor” and
    “shame” language (e.g., <hi rend="italic">Ieiun.</hi> 8.3-4), his
    reference to “envy” (<hi rend="italic">Ieiun.</hi> 7.7), and his
    schematization of Daniel and his companions as

    labors—in <hi rend="italic">mēmrā</hi> 191 in Bedjan’s

    title teases one to believe that a description of the

    might be forthcoming, but that is not Jacob’s

    Jacob addresses her acquaintances mourning her death and

    celibacy. But does that term—derivative of the root
    <hi rend="italic">QDS</hi>—connote purity, holiness or some combination
    of the two for these ancient authors? Is celibacy equivalent to
    cultic purity, holiness or both in their understandings? This
    paper will explore the variable connotations of
    <hi rend="italic">qaddishutha</hi> in the early Syriac literature and its
    implications for understanding the place of celibacy within the
    early Syriac church tradition. As in biblical and rabbinic
    Hebrew the root <hi rend="italic">QDS</hi> can connote at times
    “holy” or “sanctify” and at times
    “pure” or “ritually purify.” The
    biblical Hebrew texts are usually consistent in distinguishing
    these usages often determined only by different verbal
    patterns. The Syriac biblical texts tend to carefully preserve
    these distinctions as well. Yet the later Syriac exegetical
    texts are less concerned with preserving these differences and
    even find it advantageous to mix, match and/or elide the
    different connotations. In this paper I will compare texts from
    the <hi rend="italic">Acts of Judas Thomas</hi> and the
    <hi rend="italic">Demonstrations</hi> of Aphrahat in order to illustrate
    their semantic and theological developments, which reflect and

    Asceticism, anti-Jewish polemic, and an extensive use of the
    Old Testament are three prominent features of the
    <hi rend="italic">Demonstrations</hi> of Aphrahat that can be brought
    together by an examination of the author’s concept of
    divine Law. While many scholars have studied these areas in
    isolation, the centrality of Law-observance for Aphrahat has
    been largely overlooked. This emphasis on the Law affirms the
    basic continuity between the moral commandments of the Old
    Testament and the New, while adding a new dimension in the
    ascetic commands of Christ. In contrast to his clear rejection
    of O.T. ritual law, Aphrahat’s high view of the Decalogue
    and other O.T. moral laws forms an important part of his
    Christian spirituality. Christ’s call to a higher ascetic
    way of life does not conflict with a fundamental commitment to
    the moral code already known to the Jewish patriarchs. Though
    his role clearly goes beyond this, Christ for Aphrahat
    functions as a new and final teacher of the Law who points to
    love as the fulfillment of the Law. This emphasis on love,
    however, is a way of appreciating the fullness of the Law
    rather than a way of minimizing its importance. In its ethical
    aspect, Aphrahat’s concept of divine Law highlights
    continuity rather than discontinuity between Judaism and
    Christianity. In many respects, the <hi rend="italic">Demonstrations</hi> are
    a fairly typical example of Christian anti-Jewish literature.
    Aphrahat’s concept of divine Law, however, points to an
    unacknowledged debt to Judaism, which, along with much
    anti-Jewish polemical material, is common to many early
    Christian writers.</p>

    Christians had religious interaction with Greek speaking
    Christians. This religious interaction led Syriac speaking
    Christians to compare their Syriac Bible text with the Greek
    Bible text and, eventually, to produce a translation of the
    Greek Bible into Syriac. In 616-617, at Alexandria in Egypt,
    Paul of Tella undertook a translation of the Greek Old
    Testament into Syriac. As his textual base, he used the fifth
    column of Origen’s Hexapla. For the Book of Ezekiel, Paul
    of Tella’s translation is preserved in its entirety only
    in the photolithographic reproduction of A. Ceriani. The
    manuscript British Museum Add. 14,668, folios 26-29, preserves
    only Ezekiel 47:23-48:35. With regard to scholarly research, no

    authors tried to understand the causes of plagues (pestilence,
    famine, war) which befell the Christian communities and to
    interpret their painful subjection to Muslim rulers. They more

    Christian powers only Russia came promptly to the aid of the
    Bulgarians against the Ottoman oppressors. England, France and
    Italy did not intervene, whereas Tsar Nicolas, together with
    Prussian, American and Austrian allies, decided to send their
    troops against the Sultan. Neo-Syriac poetry goes beyond the
    narrow scope of local historiography and enters the broader
    stage of international politics, where the position of (East-)
    Syrian Christianity must be defined not only in opposition to
    Muslim neighbors but also in relationship to

    resistance against the Chalcedonians and provided a

    create a flexible church framework which could care for the

    Almost two centuries after the decline of Church of the East in
    the latter half of the fourteenth century, this church
    experienced a remarkable recovery during the first two
    centuries of Ottoman influence in the region. Although the
    earliest signs of recovery predate the extension of Ottoman
    influence in Kurdistan (manuscript production is increasing
    from the 1450-ies onwards), it is in the late sixteenth and
    seventeenth centuries that the Church of the East regained much
    of its former strength in matters of language and literature.
    The center of literary revival was first located in Gazarta
    d-Bet Zabday (present-day Cizre in southeastern Turkey) and
    later shifted to Alqosh and the nearby monastery of Rabban
    Hormizd (in present-day North Iraq). In the same period, the
    Church of the East became open to the influence of the Roman
    Catholic Church, which led to a number of unions, the first of
    which was initiated by the monk Yuhannan Sulaqa in 1553.
    Towards the end of the seventeenth century, a stable uniat
    patriarchate emerged in Diyarbakır, which in the early

    paper examines how and potentially why the Syriac translation
    of Nilus of Ancyra’s <hi rend="italic">De monastica exercitatione</hi>
    was adapted from the Greek original.  Nilus of Ancyra, a
    late fourth/early fifth century ascetic, wrote this work before
    425 as a prophetic call to the monks of his day to mend their
    ways and return to the ideals of the ascetic way of life. 
    The Greek text of the <hi rend="italic">De monastica exercitatione</hi> is
    divided into three parts: Nilus’ perception of the origin
    and aim of asceticism, the responsibilities of a monastic
    superior, and the duties of all ascetics. The Syriac
    translator of the <hi rend="italic">De monastica exercitatione</hi> excised
    roughly the first third of the work and in several places
    re-contextualized transitions between ideas and even reworked
    some of Nilus’ examples of the ascetic life. By
    paying careful attention to the Syriac vocabulary used and
    noting which descriptions have been altered or added, I will
    investigate what patterns emerge and what the Syriac editor
    wished to highlight in this work.  Without Nilus’
    introductory description of the history of asceticism, how does
    the Syriac editor portray its development and current
    state?  Does the editor try to downplay or alter
    Nilus’ urgent message of reform and why? Are these
    changes influenced by the writings of other Syriac authors and
    what audience does the editor intend to reach? These

    ways. One was their domination by the two world powers,
    Persia and Byzantium, hostile to their Christianity, the former
    Zoroastrian and the latter still pagan. The Arabs, however,
    were politically and militarily more prominent than the
    Aramaeans—a fact reflected in their semi-independent
    vassal states to the two world powers. Thus, they were
    able to give some protection to their Semitic cousins in such
    centers of Arab power as Edessa and Hira, both in the Land of
    the Two Rivers, the one under Roman suzerainty and the other
    under the Persian.</p>

    Edessa, although a Seleucid foundation, was ruled by the
    Abgarid Arab Dynasty, from 132 B.C. for three and a half
    centuries. Ca. A.D. 200, Abgar IX adopted Christianity as
    the state religion, and thus Edessa became in this sense a
    Christian city, and it developed into the spiritual capital of
    the Semitic Christian Orient, the counterpart of Antioch for
    the Greek. Its history as the Holy City of the Christian
    Semitic Orient is well known; less known is the Arab

    Severus of Antioch, an uncompromising critic of the
    Chalcedonian formula, which affirms that Jesus Christ was
    “one Person” made known “in two
    natures”, criticized the Council of Chalcedon both in the
    light of tradition and in the light of theological principles.
    He admitted that earlier Fathers used the “two
    natures” formula, but he argues that those Fathers
    employed it before the outbreak of the Nestorian controversy.
    In later times the situation changed, and the imprecise and
    innocent expressions of the past were advanced as concomitant
    with the theological tradition based on the Nicene Creed as
    confirmed by the Councils of Constantinople in 381 and Ephesus
    in 431. Leo of Rome, ignoring the tradition established in
    the Church, insisted on the phrase “in two natures”
    in his Tome, and the Council of Chalcedon adopted it. The
    expressions “two natures after the union” or
    “in two natures” implied that the human child had
    been formed in the womb by himself first, and that God the Word
    assumed him at a later time. According to this view, the man
    remains man and God the Son remains God the Son in a state of
    conjunct existence, without being united in any real sense.
    This opinion is precisely what Nestorianism had affirmed and
    the Council of Ephesus in 431 had declared to be heretical. On
    the strength of passages from the writings of Diodore,
    Theodore, Nestorius and Theodoret, Severus concludes that the
    Antiochene tradition did not affirm a real union of the
    natures; they maintained only the conjunct existence in Christ
    of God the Son and the man. Thus they had insisted on
    “two natures after the union”. Therefore, in its
    historical context, the Council of Chalcedon cannot have meant
    anything more than this Antiochene emphasis by the phrase
    “in two natures”.</p>

    Cambridge manuscript Mm.6.29 contains several unique examples
    of Syriac translations of Greek alchemical texts, including
    works of the renowned Egyptian alchemist Zosimus (fl. ca. AD
    300) that do not survive in the original Greek. Among these is
    the supposed correspondence of an Egyptian priest, Pebechius,
    with a Persian magus, Osron, concerning the Egyptian recovery
    of ancient Persian science. In the first letter Pebechius
    claims to have discovered the ancient books of Ostanes (a
    legendary Persian alchemist who is said in other works to have
    lived in the time of Xerxes, i.e. the 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> century
    BC, and to have presided over mysteries in Egypt).
    Osron’s reply begs Pebechius to share these ancient
    sciences. Pebechius answers that the books of Ostanes include
    the whole art of astrology, the manufacture of gold, and
    mysteries of Hermes.</p>

    Although the provenance of this text is unknown, its contents

    story in a text attributed to Ostanes himself, found in an
    Arabic manuscript claiming to contain a translation from Middle
    Persian, this Syriac text provides a new document of this

    But in the <hi rend="italic">Letter to the monks of Senoun</hi>, written four
    decades later (521), Philoxenus goes to great lengths to
    convince the monks that what he is teaching them does not
    contradict Ephrem’s ideas. In doing so, he rephrases some
    of Ephrem’s theological language and subtly criticizes
    the imprecision of his terminology.</p>

    as the bishop of Shenna, a city in northern Iraq. Narsai is
    presented as the strongest model of the solitary, silent,
    meditative life as lived by Plato, “who is wiser in
    philosophy than all other men.” He is depicted as
    receiving Platonic, mystical revelations of God’s throne
    as the reward for the perfection of his spiritual discipline.
    The analogies that Thomas describes between the architectural
    elements of Beth Abe’s church and heavenly structures and
    congregations are well known. This paper will discuss the
    connection, made by Thomas, between Narsai’s Christian
    Platonic spirituality, his holy visions and the depth and
    perfection of his pastoral care. His followers in Shenna are
    the great beneficiaries of this spirituality and his connection
    to heaven because these open floodgates of miracles,
    particularly miracles of physical healing and convicting words
    of knowledge. Significantly, many whose lives are improved by
    his spiritual gifts are Arabs. I will argue that Thomas could
    be using Narsai’s life as a demonstration of the
    Christian life as the best reflection of Platonic philosophy
    rather than Islam since it is in the late 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> and
    early 9th c. when Muslim Arabs begin to claim Platonic thought
    as their own.</p>

    creation of the Ataturk Dam in 1991 was preceded by at least a
    decade of archaeological field work in its catchment, which
    spanned the Turkish Lower Euphrates from Samsat in the south to
    Elazig in the north, approximately.  In the context of a
    survey of those parts of the province of Adiyaman that were due
    to be submerged, archaeologists from the British Institute of
    Archaeology in Ankara recorded the structures of three
    complexes built in a canyon of the Euphrates, just south of
    Gerger. The names of two of the complexes are
    known: Mar Abhai (“Monastery of the Ladders”)
    and Piscina. Their history can be traced from the
    11<hi rend="sup">th</hi> to 17<hi rend="sup">th</hi> centuries through the
    writings of Michael the Syrian and manuscript
    colophons. Their church architecture is related to that of
    the Tur ʿAbdin churches, but also has
    elements in common with other Euphrates area churches.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P86"/>[86] The
    churches have been previous published through brief reports in
    archaeological journals that are not easily
    accessible. Their full publication will form part of my
    PhD studies in Byzantine architectural history.</p>

    References to women in fifth-sixth century Syriac Christian and
    somewhat later Arabic Muslim writings indicate a
    <hi rend="italic">Semitic</hi> perception of their ‘proper’ role
    in faith and works. The Syriac <hi rend="italic">Bnat Qyama</hi> are a
    case in point. One <hi rend="italic">memra</hi> about a deceased
    <hi rend="italic">Bart Qyama</hi>, attributed to Jacob of Serug, gives a
    glimpse into details of the daily life, even the clothing of
    the <hi rend="italic">Bnat Qyama</hi>. At least one of these
    details—the black veil (of mourning: for the deceased
    bridegroom) evokes images of the contemporary Gulf States.</p>

    Qurʿanic parallels may point to further
    similarities between Syrian Christian and Arab Muslim
    women. There are a number of instances in which the
    <hi rend="italic">Qur<hi rend="sup">c</hi>an</hi> utilizes the feminine and masculine
    plurals of the same word:  men and women are
    believers—but also hypocrites and idolaters—and
    they both fast and give alms. Notably absent from these
    parallels are men and women who pray and make the pilgrimage,
    as well as male and female disbelievers. Male and female
    <hi rend="italic">Bnay Qyama</hi> were believers who fasted and gave
    alms. Although they both prayed, the women could not serve
    in the church in the same fashion as their male
    counterparts. Women also could not move about freely, so
    ‘pilgrimage’ would have been difficult.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P89"/>[89] A
    culture common to Syriac Christianity and Arabic
    Islam—evidenced in part by the roles of women in the
    faith—may explain the comfortable cohabitation of the two
    religious traditions. Syriac texts may also provide
    additional clues to elusive Qurʿanic
    references.</p>

                <p xml:lang="en">In humanity’s search for an encounter with the divine,
                    prayer holds a very important place. The present monograph zooms in on
                    the praying individual, using as its sources descriptions, often
                    self-descriptions, of a group of ascetic authors between the fifth and
                    the eighth century, most of whom belong to the East Syriac tradition.
                    With the exception of John of Apamea, they all represent the specific
                    branch of East Syriac ascetic Christianity that took its main
                    inspiration from the Syriac tradition of the writings of Evagrius
                    Ponticus. The book, however, offers much more than a study of the Syriac
                    reception of Evagrius, as it highlights the agency and the creative
                    responses of Syriac authors, who shaped their own ideas and reflected on
                    their own multifaceted experiences during prayer, experiences they were
                    eager to share with their disciples and readers. Contextualizing prayer
                    within the wider discourse of asceticism, the author engages with
                    scholarship on East Syriac ascetic literature as it developed over the
                    last one hundred years—if we take Paul Bedjan’s 1908 edition of (the
                    first part of) Isaac of Nineveh’s <hi rend="italic">Mystic
                        Treatises</hi> and A. J. Wensinck’s 1923 English translation of the
                    same texts as the starting point. Among the large body of scholarship,
                    special mention should be made of Sebastian Brock’s 1987 richly
                    annotated anthology, <hi rend="italic">The Syriac Fathers on Prayer and
                        the Spiritual Life</hi>, which to some extent sets the parameters
                    for the present book. This new publication, extremely well documented
                    and eloquently written, marks an important step forward in disclosing
                    the richness of Syriac ascetic literature.</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">Chapter 1 (pp. 21–51) introduces the topic of
                    prayer in its Late Antique context. It briefly surveys the philosophical
                    tradition, starting with the second-century sophist Maximus of Tyre, and
                    its reception by Clement of Alexandria and Origen, up to Evagrius, who
                    understands prayer as “a conversation of the <hi rend="italic">nous</hi>
                    with God” and whose theory “reveals its radical originality in terms of
                    its religious anthropology and technologies of the self” (pp. 46–47).
                    Chapter 2 (pp. 53–78) discusses “John of Apamea on Silent Prayer.” While
                    the tripartite model of John’s anthropology (body, soul, and spirit) was
                    widely accepted by later ascetic authors, his exposure to Greek learning
                    and his possible acquaintance with some of Evagrius’ writings remain
                    debated in present-day scholarship. For the author, “John is
                    representative of a unique moment in Syriac indigenous spirituality—just
                    before it was affected by the <hi rend="italic">Evagriana Syriaca</hi>”
                    (p. 78).</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">In chapter 3 (pp. 79–103), Isaac of Nineveh (late
                    7th cent.) enters the scene, heir to John of Apamea and an avid reader
                    of Evagrius. Exploring the boundaries of Evagrius’ notion of “pure
                    prayer,” Isaac proposes instead the experience of “non-prayer,” a
                    condition in which prayer is replaced by “wonder”: <foreign
                        xml:lang="syr">ܬܡܗܐ</foreign> (translated as “stupor” on p. 181) or
                    <foreign xml:lang="syr">ܬܗܪܐ</foreign>. Chapter 4 (pp. 105–135)
                    deals with Dadishoʿ Qaṭraya, Isaac’s contemporary, who draws his
                    inspiration from a larger number of sources (including Mark the Monk and
                    Abba Isaiah) and aims at a wider audience, including simple brothers who
                    may have less interest in Theodore of Mopsuestia’s biblical exegesis as
                    practiced in the schools. Chapter 5 (pp. 137–158) has Shemʿon d-ṭaybutheh as its subject, who flourished roughly
                    in the same period and whose literary corpus remains ill defined. (That
                    he was a physician and the author of medical writings quoted in Bar
                    Bahlul and in a number of Arabic sources may be incorrect, as recently
                    argued by Grigory Kessel.) Shemʿon’s interest in the bodily aspects of
                    asceticism leads him to a holistic approach to ascetic practice,
                    understood “as a performance of introspection” (p. 157). Among his
                    sources of inspiration—in addition to those known to his predecessors—is
                    the Pseudo-Dionysian corpus, available in Syriac since the early sixth
                    century and briefly mentioned already by Isaac, but more prominent in
                    Shemʿon.</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">With the last two chapters, we move into the eighth
                    century. Chapter 6 (pp. 159–188) discusses John of Dalyatha whose
                    mystical discourse “is marked by a density of ecstatic and emotional
                    expression [and] radical theological claims regarding encounter and
                    union with the divine” (p. 160). Even more than Shemʿon’s, John’s work
                    is indebted to Pseudo-Dionysius. Chapter 7 (pp. 189–213) deals with
                    Joseph Ḥazzaya, who in his description of prayer draws a clear
                    distinction between prayer “in the sphere of limpidity (<foreign
                        xml:lang="syr">ܫܦܝܘܬܐ</foreign>),” which belongs to the stage of the
                    soul (<foreign xml:lang="syr">ܢܦܫܢܘܬܐ</foreign>), and prayer in the
                    spiritual stage (<foreign xml:lang="syr">ܪܘܚܢܘܬܐ</foreign>), where the
                    intellect’s vision has no image or form, “but is invested with a single
                    vision of the light, to which nothing can be likened” (p. 197). The book
                    ends with an “Afterword” (pp. 215–226), a most welcome recapitulation of
                    some major points at the end of this fascinating and high-energy ascetic
                    journey.</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">Carefully selecting the topics of discussion for
                    each of the chapters, the author fully succeeds in “listen[ing] to the
                    unique voices of the various texts” (p. ix). In this process, she is
                    able to bring a good measure of convergence and cohesion to the
                    multiplicity of texts, with many cross-references and echoes back and
                    forth. What holds the book together, however, also raises some
                    questions. The author’s specific interest in deliberate reflections on
                    prayer and in the discourse on the praying self brings her almost by
                    definition to the body of literature impacted by the introduction of
                    Evagrius’ writings to the Syriac-speaking world. Texts that do not fit
                    this paradigm are left out of consideration, and we run the risk of
                    losing sight of the broader picture of Syriac literature on prayer. It
                    is worth noting that Sebastian Brock’s anthology, <hi rend="italic">The
                        Syriac Fathers on Prayer</hi>, has a different scope and includes
                    Aphrahaṭ, Ephrem, the <hi rend="italic">Book of Steps</hi>, Philoxenus,
                    and others. Even within the Church of the East, Evagrius’ influence was
                    not felt equally by all ascetic writers, as is shown, for example, by
                    the <hi rend="italic">Book of Gifts</hi> of Shubḥalmaran of Karka d-Beth
                    Slokh, a contemporary of Babai (ed. David J. Lane, CSCO 612–613/Syr.
                    236–237, 2004). These non-Evagrian texts stand in the same linguistic,
                    literary, and cultural tradition and must have been read by the same
                    monastic communities. Interestingly, the author occasionally points to
                    expressions or specific ideas that the texts she discusses share with
                    other Syriac compositions (the concept of “self-emptying,” <foreign
                        xml:lang="syr">ܡܣܪܩܘܬܐ</foreign>, may serve as an example, see
                    p. 154), thus warning the reader not to regard the selected texts as
                    disconnected from the rest of Syriac literature.</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">Partly related is the larger issue of Greek vs.
                    Syriac. Several of the foundational ascetic texts discussed in this book
                    are of Greek origin and were subsequently translated into Syriac. Our
                    Syriac ascetic authors, who may have known some Greek and may have been
                    aware that the texts had a Greek provenance, only used the Syriac
                    translations. Given our awareness of historical developments, it is
                    difficult in our descriptions to avoid terminology that implies some
                    binary, as the following phrases indicate: “this inter-cultural process
                    of hybridization, incorporating Greek patristic learning while
                    maintaining many indigenous features” (p. 8); “the melding of
                    [Evagrius’] insights with Syriac ascetic transcendent thought … in
                    addition to other indigenous concepts” (p. 50); “Dadishoʿ’s process of
                    adoption and selection from the Greek and Syriac literary ascetic
                    legacy” (p. 106); “[Dadishoʿ’s] efforts to harmonize the amalgam of the
                    Greek and Syriac ascetic traditions” (p. 115); “[the merging of] Greek
                    ascetic theories with indigenous Syrian spirituality” (p. 222). While
                    such language is historically justified, and the author shows much
                    subtlety and insight in navigating the complex linguistic and cultural
                    processes, I find her book also to be a stimulus to rethink the ways in
                    which we talk about the divide between what is Greek and what is
                    “indigenous” in Syriac literature, even centuries after the
                    indigenization of much Greek thought.</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">Finally, I would like to comment on one of the
                    author’s conclusions, namely “the relative paucity of biblical exegesis
                    in the formation of the East Syrian mystical discourse” (p. 222) and her
                    suggestion that “[t]hose authors made a deliberate choice to scrutinize
                    the self rather than the Scriptures” (p. 224). I would like to offer one
                    counter-argument. On pp. 90–93, the author discusses the state of
                    “wonder and stillness,” in which the corporeal consciousness is eclipsed
                    and which, according to Isaac of Nineveh, is achieved by prayer at the
                    spiritual stage. The author sees this sensation of “wonder” as Isaac’s
                    own contribution and refers to it as “the peculiar Syriac notion of
                    wonder” (p. 174). While the term indeed has a Syriac pedigree and may be
                    traced back to Ephrem (see Brock, <hi rend="italic">The Syriac Fathers
                        on Prayer</hi>, p. xxxi), Isaac may (also) have thought about
                    biblical precedents, following Theodore of Mopsuestia. In his treatise
                    “On the revelations and powers that happen to the saints in images” (ed.
                    Bedjan, pp. 154–161; tr. Wensinck, pp. 105–109), Isaac explicitly
                    mentions as his source “the writings of … Theodore , … especially the
                    three volumes on Genesis … and on Acts.” As is clear from his examples,
                    Isaac has in mind the state of ἔκστασις which according to the Greek
                    Bible fell upon Adam (Gen. 2:21, during the creation of Eve), upon
                    Abraham (Gen. 15:12, following his sacrifice), and upon Peter (Acts
                    10:10, during his vision). Theodore’s definition of the term ἔκστασις is
                    preserved in the Greek biblical <hi rend="italic">Catena</hi> (<hi
                        rend="italic">ad</hi> Gen. 15:12): “the condition of being outside
                    the awareness of the surrounding things (<foreign xml:lang="gr">ἔξω τῆς τῶν παρόντων
                    αἰσθήσεως</foreign>), (which) prepares the thought (τὴν διάνοιαν) for the
                    reception of the theory (<foreign xml:lang="gr">θεωρίαν</foreign>) of the hidden things” (ed. F. Petit,
                    <hi rend="italic">La chaîne sur la Genèse</hi>, III, 1995, p. 58 (no. 964)); a nearly identical definition is
                    found <hi rend="italic">ad</hi> Gen. 2:21 (ed. Petit, <hi rend="italic"
                        >La chaîne</hi>, I,
                    1991, p. 205 (no. 299)). Even while the Peshitta reads <foreign
                        xml:lang="syr">ܫܠܝܐ</foreign> “stillness” in the two passages in
                    Genesis and <foreign xml:lang="syr">ܬܡܗܐ</foreign> “wonder” in Acts,
                    East Syriac biblical commentators apply Theodore’s explanation
                    invariably and almost literally to the three passages, as for example
                    the <hi rend="italic">Diyarbakır Commentary</hi> (ed. Van Rompay, CSCO
                    483–484/Syr.205–206, 1986, pp. 32:13–16 and 74:24–27 [text]; pp. 42 and
                    96 [transl.]), and Ishoʿdad of Merv (ed. M. D. Gibson and J. R. Harris,
                    <hi rend="italic">Commentaries on the New Testament</hi>, IV, 1903, pp. <foreign xml:lang="syr"
                            >ܟܚ</foreign> and 20). It seems very likely that Isaac, in analyzing
                    the ascetic’s advanced stage of prayer, took his cues from biblical
                    examples as understood by Theodore. Additional evidence of the prominent
                    role that biblical exegesis had for the East Syriac ascetical authors
                    may be seen in Joseph Ḥazzaya’s <hi rend="italic">On Providence</hi>
                    (ed. N. Kavvadas, 2016), which for the most part is a narration of
                    biblical history, often following in Theodore’s footsteps.</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">That this new monograph, in addition to offering
                    such an engaged and well-informed reading of key passages in East Syriac
                    ascetic literature, also raises interesting questions is the best
                    guarantee for its usefulness in future research. By covering five of the
                    most prominent writers over a period of two centuries, the author
                    provides a broader framework and a number of signposts, which lead us to
                    a fuller appreciation of an important subfield of Syriac literature and,
                    more generally, of the intellectual history of Syriac Christianity. This
                    is a most welcome contribution for which we should be very thankful!</p>

                Peeters, 2019). Pp. xi + 464; €105.00.</ab>
            </div>
            <div type="body" xml:lang="en">

            <p xml:lang="en">The main question Metselaar’s book seeks to answer is how seventh-century East Syriac
                catholicoi formulated their theoogical views in response to nascent Islam and its
                fundamental rejection of Christ’s divinity. As the author states in her
                introduction, the study of the christology of Ishoʿyahb III offers a valuable
                perspective because his theology reflects the earlier theological discourse while he
                also adjusts his christological views within the new Islamic context. In order to
                understand the intricate theoretical argumentation and terminology which marked this
                theological dispute, Metselaar starts at the beginning of the East Syriac
                tradition.</p>
            <p xml:lang="en">Chapter 1 constitutes an excellent introduction to the theological tradition of the
                Church of the East. Beginning with Aphrahat and Ephrem (pp. 17–26), the author draws
                attention to the later christological implications of their definition of <hi rend="italic">qnoma</hi> in
                trinitarian doctrine (p. 154). She then traces the formation of the
                two-<hi rend="italic">qnome</hi>-formula through the theological statements of the early Antiochene school
                and Theodore of Mopsuestia (pp. 26–52), observing that Theodore’s use of the
                terminology could lead to divergent interpretations (p. 48), which indeed animated
                the sixth-century debates within the School of Nisibis (pp. 91–97) and which
                encouraged a ‘one-<hi rend="italic">qnoma</hi>-interpretation’ by Sahdona, an opponent of Ishoʿyahb III
                (pp. 309, 311). She then moves on to the relation between <hi rend="italic">qnoma</hi>, hypostasis, and
                <hi rend="italic">prosopon</hi> in Nestorius (pp. 53–65) and the ramifications for later theological
                developments within the Church of the East. Lastly, the chapter surveys the
                subsequent reception of these creedal formulas within the Church of the East, from
                the first synod of 410 to the confirmation of the Theodorian standpoint at the
                synod of 612, claiming that a hardening of the Miaphysite position, as well as
                Justinian’s attempts to find a doctrinal compromise, gave momentum to the
                crystal¬lization of the East Syriac theological position.</p>
            <p xml:lang="en">Although internal divisions continued, a Theodorian christology became normative
                after the theological debate of 612, which constitutes the centrepiece of chapter 2.
                The author starts her inquiry with a detailed analysis of Babai’s christology,
                contending that a growing Miaphysite influence in Persia, internal voices advocating
                qnomatic union, and threats posed by Origenist tendencies in monastic circles
                elicited a stricter adherence to Theodore’s formulas in Babai’s work (pp. 127–38).
                Throughout her study, the author keeps closely intertwined the soteriological,
                epistemological, and christological aspects of Babai’s theology (and that of
                others). As she notes, Babai considered the preservation of the human nature in
                Christ as a critical factor for the correct epistemological process leading to
                knowledge of the transcendent God. The author then surveys the theological debate of
                612, when East Syriac representatives officially formulated a doctrine of ‘two <hi rend="italic">qnome</hi>
                in one <hi rend="italic">parsopa</hi>,’ relying largely on Babai’s formulations. The chapter closes with an
                inquiry into the christology of Ishoʿyahb II. As the author notes, his theology was
                articulated in response to challenges similar to those encountered by his
                predecessor Babai, especially with regard to internal opponents claiming a uniquely
                divine parsopa (pp. 195–97), but constitutes also a reaction to contemporary
                Monenergism, a dogmatic compromise promoted by Heraclius to seek doctrinal
                reconciliation (p. 193). </p>
            <p xml:lang="en">Chapter 3 takes the reader to the core of the inquiry. It investigates the leadership
                of Ishoʿyahb III in the earliest years of Islamic rule. A lengthy and meticulous
                historical excursus situates the patriarchate of Ishoʿyahb III in the context of the
                critical yet chaotic transition from Sasanian rule to the subsequent establishment
                of Byzantine and then Islamic governance. Metselaar surveys Ishoʿyahb’s letters in
                order to investigate the catholicos’s attitude vis-à-vis Islamic power. The apostasy
                of the <hi rend="italic">Marawnaye</hi>, a hitherto unidentified south Arabian population, gives Ishoʿyahb
                the occasion to develop a compromise position which defended the spiritual benefits
                of Christianity while making Arab rulership acceptable to a Christian subject (pp.
                263–68). This stance is further advo¬cated in the patriarch’s letters that address
                the rebellion on the coast of the Arabic peninsula: by claiming that allegiance to
                both the Church and the Islamic rulership is divinely ordered, the catholicos
                advocates Christian submission to secular leaders as well as to God (pp. 268–77),
                and he equates rebellion with apostasy as both result from feeble faith (pp.
                277–79).</p>
            <p xml:lang="en">The religious landscape into which Islamic power was planted, as Metselaar notes at
                the beginning of the chapter, was quite diverse. It is against this background that
                Ishoʿyahb understands christological notions in Islamic theology as a refutation of
                Theopaschism, a common accusation brought forth by East Syrians against the
                Miaphysites (pp. 227–32, 286–87). </p>
            <p xml:lang="en">But Ishoʿyahb III also formulates his christology more systematically in response to
                the competing one-<hi rend="italic">qnoma</hi>-formula proposed by his opponent Sahdona, a theme that
                constitutes the bulk of chapter 4. Although Ishoʿyahb was swift to dismiss his
                enemy’s christology as Miaphysitism, Sahdona did draw on the East Syriac tradition.
                Metselaar examines how Sahdona utilized the theology of Theodore and Nestorius to
                promote a one-<hi rend="italic">qnoma</hi>-creed, while ignoring conflicting statements in these works
                (pp. 307–15). In his response, Ishoʿyahb drew an etymological and logical
                distinction between qnoma and parsopa in order to oppose the idea of a qnomatic
                union as argued by Sahdona (pp. 319–22). It is in this defence of his christological
                views that, as Metselaar shows, Ishoʿyahb mitigated his christological nomenclature
                in so far as it might potentially conflict with Quranic statements against Christ’s
                divinity (pp. 337–45) in order to make it more acceptable in a Muslim-dominated
                context. </p>
            <p xml:lang="en">In chapter 5, Metselaar briefly treats the career and christological views of the
                subsequent East Syriac catholicoi up to the end of the seventh century, pointing out
                that anti-Islamic concerns became more pronounced as the Islamic identity of the
                caliphate grew more distinct. Remarkably, as she argues, Catholicos George I also
                attempted to show the agreement between different Christian denominations in order
                to enhance Christian reputation before Muslim power.</p>
            <p xml:lang="en">In the final chapter, the author summarizes her findings. Although this chapter is a
                useful tool that helps the reader to navigate the immense amount of information
                offered in the book, it regrettably remains on an expository level while it could
                have been used to tie the chapters together in an overall argument.</p>
            <p xml:lang="en">The main merit of this volume is that it offers an extensive and meticulous
                exposition of the christological tradition of the Church of the East in its late
                antique political context. Yet, in my view, this book would have fully accomplished
                what it set out to do if the various sections and chapters had been tied into a more
                clear and coherent narrative. The author insightfully pinpoints here and there the
                entanglement of political and religious motives in the formulation of christological
                views, but in terms of structure and narrative, she rarely explicitly connects the
                historical and theological trajectories of her book. </p>
            <p xml:lang="en">One would more gladly indulge in reading lengthy, in-depth historical excursus if the
                author had clarified at the outset their relevance for the overall argument, or had
                more explicitly articulated how some historical information is related to the
                christological formulations of the period. For instance, historical excursus on
                Miaphysite Arab tribes and their political influence in early Islam are scattered
                throughout the first and third chapters, before the author highlights their role in
                fostering one-<hi rend="italic">qnoma</hi>-tendencies within the Church of the East. Or, to give another
                example, the importance of the digression on the chronology of the Arab conquest of
                Nineveh (p. 220) comes to the fore only on page 281, when it proves useful for
                understanding when and how Ishoʿyahb III recognized Arabs as secular leaders.</p>
            <p xml:lang="en">As the book aims to focus on the Church of the East in its relation with nascent
                Islam, it would have been helpful if some themes had been treated more extensively:
                for instance, whether the supposed collaboration with Ali’s supporters (p. 276) may
                have facilitated the transmission of ideas about secular and ecclesiastical power to
                Ishoʿyahb III (p. 292); or why the christology of Ishoʿyahb III omits mention of
                Jesus as ‘servant of God’ (p. 342), when it would have offered a common ground with
                Islamic theology (pp. 231–32). </p>
            <p xml:lang="en">This aside, overall this is a remarkably learned work, which combines great accuracy
                and breadth. It not only presents a rich survey of East Syriac theology through the
                seventh century but also sparkles with insightful comments on the complex
                intertwining of politics and theology within the Church of the East in the first
                decades of Islamic rule. </p>

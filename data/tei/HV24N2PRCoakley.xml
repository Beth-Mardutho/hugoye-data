                <p xml:lang="en">In 1971 Arthur Vööbus announced the discovery of the
                    commentary of Mushe bar Kepha on Luke, in ms. 102 of the collection of the Church of
                    the Forty Martyrs in Mardin.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn1" n="1"><p

                        Kēphā,” <hi rend="italic">ZNW</hi> 62 (1971), 132–134. </p></note>
                    (Unmentioned by him, the manuscript had previously been recorded by Patriarch
                    Barsoum in his <hi rend="italic">Scattered Pearls</hi>, although it was then in the
                    library of Deir es-Zafaran.) In 1980 I visited Prof. Vööbus at his home and saw the
                    desk at which he said he was at work on an edition of this text. He must, however,
                    have abandoned the project, possibly if for no other reason because he found his
                    photographs were incomplete. Abdul-Massih Saadi tells us (in a preface in which some
                    more details would have been welcome) that that is what he found when he was later
                    in charge of the Vööbus collection of microfilms at the Lutheran School of Theology.
                    Nor, evidently, did any of Vööbus’s working papers come down to him. At all events,
                    Saadi sought out the manuscript afresh in Mardin, and started over. That was more
                    than twenty years ago, and whatever we might miss by not having Vööbus’s work, we
                    have here the evident and satisfying product of that many years’ labor on the part
                    of the present accomplished editor. </p>
                <p xml:lang="en">Ms. Mardin 102 has 99 leaves of neat but closely-written text,
                    and in the first half of the codex the leaves are more or less water-damaged. (This
                    much may be seen from the images of the manuscript now on the HMML website.<note

                            no. CFMM00102. The manuscript is here foliated including the blank leaves
                            that a binder has inserted in various places, and keeping the wrong order of
                            leaves at the beginning. Saadi has ignored the blanks and re-numbered the
                            folios to recover their original order. The resulting different foliations
                            will be an inconvenience to a few; but we keep Saadi’s foliation here, since
                            it is after all a rational scheme and is now captured in print.</p></note>)
                    Saadi has had to read the faded text, and he has been able to do this mostly very
                    well, often but not always with the help of Dionysius bar Ṣalibi’s commentary, which
                    copies Mushe extensively. Only sometimes does he have to indicate illegible gaps in
                    the text. Further gaps are caused by missing leaves, with which Saadi does not deal
                    quite so adequately. Using the quire-signatures that show in the HMML images, we can
                    be more specific about these gaps, some of which can be filled in, or partly so,
                    from Dionysius bar Ṣalibi:<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn3" n="3"><p

                    of chapters 1–12 are lost. In Dionysius’s commentary (pp. 219–225) there are 8
                    chapters, said to be an abridgement (<foreign xml:lang="syr">ܒܦܣܝ̈ܩܬܐ</foreign>), the last of
                    which overlaps Mushe’s no. 13 on the birthday of Jesus. These chapters anyhow can be
                    credited in substance to Mushe. </p>

                    somewhat surprising, since the gap takes in only Luke 2:22–33 (only 6 pages in
                    Dionysius: 281–286); but Mushe must have had a very lengthy treatment of the

                <p xml:lang="en">Comparing Saadi’s text with the HMML images, I found his
                    transcription to be generally very accurate, although slightly less agreeable at the
                    level of punctuation. He has chosen to omit much of the very full pointing of words
                    in the manuscript, but sometimes the omission has gone too far. The upper dots on
                    participles, at least when they are homographs, should always be transcribed for
                    comfort and accuracy in reading.</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">Mushe bar Kepha wrote his commentary on Luke after that on
                    Matthew, and for material in common between the two gospels he repeatedly refers to
                    his earlier work.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn5" n="5"><p rend="H BR Footnote">
                        Unfortunately for us, only very partially surviving in BL Add. 17274. This
                        also includes one leaf from the commentary on Luke, which would have been
                        worth bringing into the present edition.</p></note> This means that the
                    commentary on Luke is weighted toward chs. 1–2 which are special to Luke (79 pp. of
                    Saadi’s text, out of 188). The details of the annunciation to Zechariah (Luke
                    1:5–23), the reasons why he was rendered deaf and dumb (v. 20), and the naming of
                    John the Baptist in writing (vv. 59–63) are explained at immense length. Here and
                    throughout, Mushe’s commentary might be described as plodding. It is easy to follow,
                    and hardly ever becomes enigmatic by reason of extreme brevity as does the work of
                    his contemporary Ishoʿdad of Merv. He comments on the details of every narrative. An
                    example outside the infancy stories is Jesus’s rebuke to Martha in Luke 10:41 which
                    is explained in four different ways to do with simple and fancy foods; and he
                    remarks that Jesus had to say “Martha, Martha,” that is twice, because she was out
                    of the room. Probably the same need to comment on details has been a factor in the
                    allegorizing treatment of parables. As a rule, Mushe is not an allegorist:
                    “spiritual” exegesis, when it appears, is usually an appendix to a commentary
                    already given at the level of plain language. When it takes over, as in the parable
                    of the prodigal son (Luke 15:11–31), it is because there are circumstantial details
                    which he evidently cannot leave unexplained, for example the “best robe” (v. 22)
                    which must mean baptism and the “fatted ox” (v. 23) who is Christ himself. </p>
                <p xml:lang="en">Saadi’s English translation is confident and reads smoothly
                    (although there are small lapses in grammar and the omission of words which a
                    proof-reader might have eliminated). That is not to say that everything is clear.
                    The parable of the unjust steward (Luke 16:1–9) is an inherently difficult text
                    which has been subjected to a contrived exegesis by Mushe. This has itself then
                    suffered some textual corruption, so as to make any meaningful translation
                    impossible. Mushe understands the steward to be a rich man who has cheated his
                    debtors, and who it seems deserves some sort of praise from his master (God; v. 8a)
                    because he has remitted part of their debt. But the explanation is garbled: “For one
                    he repaid two” and “I repaid one and a half for each one” (Saadi, pp. 228–229).
                    Dionysius bar Ṣalibi (p. 367) follows Mushe up to a point here but evidently does
                    not know what this means, and omits it.</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">Saadi devotes a section of his Introduction (pp. 11–16) to
                    Mushe bar Kepha’s sources. He considers that Ephrem’s commentary on the Diatessaron
                    was Mushe’s “primary source” (p. 12), although it is quoted without attribution, and
                    it may be that Ephrem’s text came to him through an intermediate channel. The poetry
                    of Ephrem and of Jacob of Serug will also have been familiar to Mushe, and Saadi’s
                    footnotes thoroughly record the likely dependence on these works. Philoxenus is
                    certainly quoted once explicitly and at length (on Luke 1:35). But for sources
                    beyond these, the search becomes rather unrewarding. Saadi remarks on the number of
                    authors, including Greek fathers, who are cited here and there; but in this
                    commentary we do not identify substantial passages taken over from earlier writers.
                    This is the case in particular if one looks for East Syriac sources that might be
                    detectable behind the commentary of Ishoʿdad of Merv: it is remarkable how
                    infrequently the comments of Mushe and Ishoʿdad agree or even expand on the same
                    exegetical points.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn6" n="6"><p rend="H BR Footnote"> J.
                        R. Harris recognized long ago that the commentaries of Mushe and Ishoʿdad
                        are independent and practically disjunct, and that Dionysius bar Ṣalibi has
                        in his own commentary done not much more than combine them (<hi
                            rend="italic">The commentaries of Isho</hi>ʿ<hi rend="italic">dad of
                                Merv</hi>, ed. M. D. Gibson, vol. 1 (Cambridge, 1911), pp.
                        xxx–xxxi).</p></note> Or again, it is possible, when as often Mushe writes
                    “Some say . . . others say,” that written sources are being alluded to (p. 12); but
                    this can be simply a commentator’s device. One might therefore be tempted to revise
                    the usual judgment on Mushe that he is a derivative author, and to allow that in
                    this commentary at least we have much that is original. But it may be instead that,
                    as Vööbus said in 1971, “Auch mit der Heranziehung unbekannter exegetischer Quellen
                    muß man rechnen.” <note place="foot" xml:id="ftn7" n="7"><p rend="H BR Footnote">
                        The case of Mushe’s commentary on Matthew is instructive. The not so
                        original character of this work emerges from a comparison with the
                        commentary by George of Beʿeltan, but it might not be suspected if the
                        latter had not fortunately survived in a single manuscript.</p></note>
                </p>
                <p xml:lang="en">That Mushe had contact with some unknown sources is shown by
                    his discussion of Luke 1:32, “The Lord will give him the seat of David, his father.”
                    He insists, against some “heretics,” that the seat, i.e. the kingdom, did not belong
                    to David as the words might suggest but that Christ first lent it to David who then
                    returned it to him. His argument is based on Genesis 49:10 and the important words
                    there from the Peshitta, “until he comes whose the kingdom is.” Apparently the
                    argument is against “Nestorians” (p. 56); but who in particular? Conceivably, it is
                    Theodore of Mopsuestia, whose commentary on this verse in Genesis is lost; but East
                    Syriac writers do not transmit this comment in his name. In fact the exegesis of
                    Genesis 49:10 was generally shared by Syriac writers of all confessions and was not
                    controversial. This is a puzzle which Mushe leaves us. But until such sources as
                    this one turn up, we have in this commentary and Saadi’s edition an irreplaceable
                    record of exegesis and link in the chain of Syriac Orthodox tradition.</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">I have spelled “Mushe” in this review, differently from Saadi’s
                    (and others’) “Moshe.” Ought we not to keep the <hi rend="italic">u</hi> vowel, as
                    the West Syriac vocalization <hi style="font-family:Serto Qezhayyadirection:rtl;"
                        >ܡܘܽܫܐ</hi> specifies? Sometimes an <hi rend="italic">o</hi> vowel can be
                    justified by an appeal to East Syriac phonology, but there the name is written
                    not<foreign xml:lang="syr">ܡܘܿܫܐ </foreign>
                    but <foreign xml:lang="syr">ܡܘܼܫܐ</foreign>. Or to keep clear of
                    disagreement, if the Hebrew <hi rend="italic">o</hi> vowel is preferred, the best
                    solution may be to westernize his name and write “Moses.”</p>

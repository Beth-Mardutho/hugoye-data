         <p rend="abstract">In the centuries following the Ottoman
    conquest of northern Mesopotamia and Kurdistan, the Church of
    the East showed a remarkable vitality, which was expressed
    among other things in a considerable manuscript production and
    the restoration of churches and monasteries. This article
    intends to highlight the contribution of women to this revival.
    It is based mainly on a study of manuscript colophons and a few
    inscriptions, which testify to the large number of women who
    were involved in financing the production of manuscripts and to
    their reasons for doing so. A closer reading of the colophons
    also reveals details about the social position of these women,
    the role of their fathers, brothers, and husbands, as well as
    about their position within the church—varying from incidental
    references to daughters of the convenant, deaconnesses and
    nuns, to highly-esteemed mothers and well-doers in the
    Christian community. Finally, the article asks for a closer
    reading of the colophons in order to enlarge our knowledge of
    the Church of the East in this period of history.</p>

         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P1"/>[1] In the
    early summer of 1707, the priest Yosep, son of the priest
    Giwargis, son of the priest Israel Alqoshaya from the Shikwana
    family, one of the famous scribes� families of Alqosh of the
    period, in his hometown finished writing a <hi rend="italic">
               <hi rend="u">t</hi>aksā d-kāhnē</hi>, a priests� office book which
    included the regular Sunday eucharistic liturgies, a few
    special liturgies and a number of <hi rend="italic">
               <hi rend="u">h</hi>uttāmē</hi> by various authors. In his colophon he
    notes: �This book of the <hi rend="italic">
               <hi rend="u">t</hi>aksā
    d-kāhnē</hi> was written thanks to the money and labor of
    Belgan, a believing woman from Alqoshta, and she bestowed it
    upon the holy church of Mar Yo<hi rend="u">h</hi>annan in
    the blessed village of Dawedaya, in the region of <hi rend="u">S</hi>apna (Amadiah region). From now on, everyone is
    required to read from it.�<ref target="#FN1">1</ref>
         </p>
         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P2"/>[2] Belgan
    from Alqoshta (a little village in the mountains of Berwari,
    about 65 miles north of Alqosh in what is now southeastern
    Turkey) is not the only woman of the Church of the East who
    makes her appearance in the Syriac manuscript colophons of the
    Ottoman period. In David Wilmshurst�s list of colophons and
    inscriptions, more than eighty women are mentioned in sixty-six
    entries made between 1500 and 1830.<ref target="#FN2">2</ref> On the total number of
    colophons and inscriptions of this period, numbering about
    1350, this already constitutes a significant group of about six
    percent, but when compared with the number of colophons that
    mention commissioners and sponsors (the roles in which women
    occur most frequently), the percentage goes up to about
    eighteen percent.<ref target="#FN3">3</ref> Although most of the colophons are edited only
    partially, the information available in the catalogues already
    provides us with a wealth of information on the women of the
    Church of the East in this period. It is this information that
    is used for the present contribution.<ref target="#FN4">4</ref>
         </p>
         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P3"/>[3] The
    period of about 1500 to 1830 is the period in which the Church
    of the East, after a century of almost complete silence
    following Timur Leng�s raids in the late fourteenth century,
    slowly recovered from the destruction and ravages wrought by
    the plague. The great majority of the East-Syriac manuscripts
    that have survived to our day date from this period, in which
    apparently a great effort was made to restore the classical
    heritage. Especially between 1670 and 1760 the large village of
    Alqosh was the center of an enormous manuscript production. Its
    scribes provided new manuscripts for village churches and
    monasteries in northern Mesopotamia and northwestern Iran that
    in this period were also often restored. Three famous families
    dominated life in this village: the Shikwana and Na<hi rend="u">s</hi>ro families, to which most of the scribes belonged,
    and the Abuna family, from which metropolitans and patriarchs
    were selected.<ref target="#FN5">5</ref> The patriarchs had their official see in the
    famous monastery of Rabban Hormizd, not far from Alqosh, and so
    added to the importance of the region. The importance of the
    Alqosh region (including the monastery of Rabban Hormizd and
    the village of Telkepe) is also reflected in the colophons of
    the manuscripts in my list: thirty-five of the fifty-eight
    manuscripts were produced here. Smaller centers of manuscript
    production were found in villages and monasteries in the west
    (Amida, Gazarta), in the Hakkari mountains (Gissa) and western
    Iran (Darband, Tergawar). In addition to the copying of older
    texts, this period also saw a limited production of new texts,
    both in Classical Syriac and in Modern Aramaic, the spoken
    language of the majroity of the members of the Church of the
    East.<ref target="#FN6">6</ref>
         </p>
         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P4"/>[4]
    Politically, the region became more and more part of the
    Ottoman Empire, although it took until the middle of the
    nineteenth century before the Ottomans were able to exercise
    any kind of effective control over the Hakkari Mountains with
    its independent Kurdish and Assyrian tribes. Roman Catholicism
    also made its influence felt in the region. In 1552, Yuhannan
    Sulaqa established official links with the papacy and in doing
    so created the uniate counter-patriarchate in 1553. Although
    his successors severed links with the papacy towards the end of
    the sixteenth century and continued as the Church of the East
    patriarchate of Qodshanis, both this line (whose patriarchs
    took the formal name Shim<hi rend="sup">c</hi>un) and the line of Rabban
    Hormizd (whose patriarchs took the formal name Eliya) had
    occasional contacts with Roman Catholic missionaries. In 1681,
    a new Catholic patriarchate (whose holders took the name of
    Yosep) was created in Amida (Diyarbakır), under the influence
    of Capuchin missionaries. In 1830, this patriarchate merged
    with the by then Catholic patriarchate of Alqosh.<ref target="#FN7">7</ref>
         </p>
         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P5"/>[5] Despite
    occasional setbacks caused by wars (between Turkey and Persia
    as well as between local rulers), outbreaks of the plague and
    looting by local robbers or rival tribes, the considerable
    manuscript production and the restoration of churches testify
    to the vitality of the Church of the East in the Ottoman
    period. However, so far hardly any attention has been paid to
    the role of women in this �awakening�. This study focuses on
    the question to what extent and in what way women participated
    in it. The following themes will be discussed: the position of
    these women within their families [6-8]; the geographical
    origin of the women and the manuscripts [9-10]; their names
    [11], money and status [12-13]; and the reasons for
    commissioning, sponsoring<ref target="#FN8">8</ref> and donating<ref target="#FN9">9</ref> [14-16]. I will end
    with a few concluding remarks [17-18].</p>
         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P6"/>[6] There
    can be little doubt that the women in the colophons are first
    and foremost identified by their family relationships. The most
    common way to introduce a woman is to add her father�s name to
    her own: Kanzadeh, daughter of the deacon Sulaiman (c. 1660,
    no. 14), Gozal, daughter of the smith <hi rend="u">H</hi>anna of Mosul (1707, no. 31), Shmuni, daughter of
    the priest <hi rend="u">H</hi>oshaba (1722, no. 37), and
    many more. In the one case of a female scribe, an extended
    genealogy is given, extending to five generations: Teresa,
    daughter of the priest Khadjodor, son of the deacon
    <hi rend="sup">c</hi>Abdelkarim, son of the priest Bakos, son of the
    priest Khadjo, son of the priest Bet Sabrisho<hi rend="sup">c</hi> of
    <hi rend="sup">c</hi>Ayn Tannur (1767, no. 53). This usage is exactly
    parallel to that regarding the men in the colophons: a brief
    genealogy (usually only the father) in the case of donors,
    sponsors and commissioners, long genealogies in case of
    scribes. In one case, a woman is identified by giving the name
    of her mother only: Naze, daughter of Shmuni (1766, no. 52),
    whereas one woman is identified first by her mother, than by
    her husband: Maryam, daughter of Elisabeth and wife of Maroge,
    of Nisibis (1586, no. 7).<ref target="#FN10">10</ref> In addition, in quite a few cases
    a mother and daughter sponsored or commissioned together, for
    instance Shona, daughter of Osha<hi rend="sup">c</hi>na and her mother
    Nasrat (1706, no. 29), <hi rend="u">H</hi>atun and her
    mother Sette, daughter of the priest Eliya of Telkepe (1710,
    no. 32), as well as <hi rend="sup">c</hi>Azize and her mother Baghdad,
    together with their father and husband Isaac, son of Giwargis
    (1705, no. 28).</p>
         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P7"/>[7] In this
    list, the second most important way of identifying a woman is
    by giving her husband�s name. However, of only twenty-one of
    the eighty-four women in the list a husband is mentioned, often
    in addition to the father, e.g. in the case of a manuscript
    donated by a couple such as Auraham, son of Mako, and his wife
    Shmuni, daughter of the priest Quriaqos (1682, no. 19), or by
    two couples together: �the money was given by the believers
    <hi rend="u">H</hi>anne, Kammo, and their righteous wives
    Sara and Maryam� (1723, no. 38). An eighteenth-century
    inscription in the church of Mar Quriaqos in Salmas simply
    says: �This church was renovated by the wife of Amr, may the
    Lord give her rest� (18<hi rend="sup">th</hi> c., no. 36). In addition
    to these twenty-one cases where a woman�s husband is explicitly
    mentioned, in eleven instances marriage can be inferred from
    the mentioning of a dowry, (grand)sons or daughters. The two
    instances of dowry (<hi rend="italic">māhrā</hi>) probably both date to the
    early eighteenth century. In the first case the manuscript
    itself constitutes the dowry, taken for the daughter of the
    priest <hi rend="sup">c</hi>Abdisho<hi rend="sup">c</hi> son of Zangish (no. 23),
    in the second, the manuscript contains a note of a dowry taken
    by the priest <hi rend="u">H</hi>anna for his daughter
    (no. 24). Both women remain anonymous.<ref target="#FN11">11</ref>
         </p>
         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P8"/>[8] A total
    of thirty-two married women among the more than eighty women in
    the list is a strikingly low number, which requires an
    exploration of the possible reasons. The most obvious one,
    although explaining only a minority of the cases, is that women
    remained unmarried for religious reasons. In five instances,
    there is little doubt: women are referred to as a nun
    (<hi rend="italic">rāhiba,</hi> Maryam, daughter of priest Hormizd of 1542,
    no. 2, and <hi rend="u">H</hi>atun in Mar Yo<hi rend="u">h</hi>annan Na<hi rend="u">h</hi>laya, 1629, no.
    12), as a daughter of the covenant (<hi rend="italic">ba(r)t qyāmā</hi>,
    Seltana, daughter of Belgana, c. 1600, no. 8), as a deaconess
    of the monastery of Mar Augin (<hi rend="italic">mshammshānītā,</hi> Maryam,
    1739, no. 45) and as a distinguished virgin (<hi rend="italic">btultā
    zāhyā</hi>, Shmuni, daughter of Marqos, 1824, no. 63).<ref target="#FN12">12</ref> In a
    number of other cases one may perhaps assume that the women
    were not married <hi rend="italic">yet</hi>, as in the case of the first
    colophon in our list, in a manuscript copied by a priest Aprem
    son of the priest Ya<hi rend="sup">c</hi>qub for �his own and learned
    daughters Tamar and Shmuni� (1521, no. 1), or our female
    copyist, the girl Teresa, daughter of the priest Khadjador, who
    was fifteen years old when she wrote her manuscript in 1767
    (no. 53).<ref target="#FN13">13</ref> In this respect, one also wonders to what
    extent the custom described by Surma d�Bait Mar Shimun (a
    member of the patriarchal family of Qodshanis) in the early
    twentieth century might explain the fact that for some women no
    husband is mentioned. She notes: �Often girls and youths live
    as virgins in their parents� house. They are called Rabbanyati
    [the usual title for nuns, MvdB] although they have not
    received the blessing of the Bishop, so they are not officially
    recognized.�<ref target="#FN14">14</ref> With perhaps a number of widows among them, it
    seems not unreasonable to assume that a significant part of the
    remaining fifty-two women were not married. In addition, there
    is the distinct possibility that even if a woman was married,
    it was not always necessary to mention that fact in the
    colophon, especially if the husband had not been personally
    involved in the commissioning or sponsoring. Whatever the
    reasons for the low number of husbands in the colophons, it
    seems to me that at the very least this indicates that husbands
    in the majority of cases were not the defining factor in
    deciding whether women could or would donate valuables or
    commission and sponsor the writing of a manuscript.</p>
         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P9"/>[9] It is
    worthwhile to take a closer look at the place names mentioned
    in these colophons. The dominance of Alqosh as a center of
    manuscript production has been mentioned above, but for a study
    of the involvement of the women, the location of the
    monasteries and churches benefiting from their generosity seems
    to be more important. Surprisingly enough, it is usually only
    the church and its location, rather than the hometown or
    village of the commissioner or sponsor, that is mentioned in
    the colophon. It seems to me that the reader of the colophon is
    meant to understand that the commissioner or sponsor lived in
    the vicinity of that particular church. One of the few
    colophons to mention the woman�s home village, is the one
    naming Belgan from the village of Alqoshta (no. 30), who
    bestowed a manuscript to a church in Dawedaya, a village about
    fifteen miles south.</p>
         <p rend="nn">
            <anchor xml:id="P10"/>[10] When
    we look up the churches and monasteries that profited from the
    generosity of the women of the Church of the East on a map, we
    find that most of these are situated in a rather circumscribed
    area: a small band stretching northwards from Mosul, via
    Telkepe, Alqosh, and Dohuk towards Dawedaya, and a little
    eastwards from there, towards Aqra, via Tella, Artun, Geppa and
    Barzane.<ref target="#FN15">15</ref> Regions that benefited to a lesser extent were
    the monasteries around Mardin, Nisibis, Seert and Gazarta in
    the west. The Hakkari mountains and the Persian territories of
    the country of the Church of the East are represented only by
    the inscriptions of Salmas,<ref target="#FN16">16</ref> and by the reference to the place
    of origin of a few women.<ref target="#FN17">17</ref> Although a comparison with the
    larger collection of colophons will perhaps refine this picture
    somewhat, these data suggest that in the southern and western
    regions the Christians were wealthier and church life was more
    active. It was not only churches and monasteries close to home
    that benefited: the Church-of-the-East community in Jerusalem
    and particularly the monastery of Mart Maryam also shared in
    the relative prosperity, which confirms the importance of this
    city in the spiritual life of the time.<ref target="#FN18">18</ref>
         </p>
         <p rend="nn">
            <anchor xml:id="P11"/>[11] Of
    the seventy-five woman�s names in the colophons, only about
    twenty-six can be considered traditional Syriac names. Most of
    these are biblical and one is Greek. These twenty-six women,
    however, share among them only nine different names, of which
    the most popular are Shmuni and Maryam (eight times each), and
    Helen (five times).<ref target="#FN19">19</ref> All other names will probably be
    identified as Persian, Arabic, Turkish, Kurdish and perhaps a
    few as more recent Aramaic/Syriac names, but much further
    research is required here. Note also here the interesting case
    of two women named after illustrious cities: Baghdad (1705, no.
    28) and Stambul (1773, no. 55), a custom that may be observed
    also among present-day Christians from the region who name
    their daughters, e.g., after the city of Edessa.<ref target="#FN20">20</ref>
         </p>
         <p rend="nn">
            <anchor xml:id="P12"/>[12] The
    most interesting aspect of these colophons is the fact that
    they show that at least some women of this period had the
    independent use of money or other possessions. Twenty-three
    women in this list are mentioned as the single donor or
    commissioner of a manuscript, whereas seven more are listed as
    having donated other valuables such as land or buildings. Some
    examples of individual commissioning are Belgan from Alqoshta,
    mentioned above (no. 30), Putta, daughter of chief
    <hi rend="sup">c</hi>Atallah of <hi rend="u">H</hi>arab Olma (ca.
    1550, no. 3), Shmuni, daughter of Na<hi rend="sup">c</hi>azar (1701, no.
    25) and Alpo (1808, no. 58). Thirty-one women donated land or
    commissioned manuscripts together with others: their husbands,
    mothers, other women or other men. The deacon Bako and his wife
    Rihana commissioned a <hi rend="italic">gazza</hi> together (1686, no. 20),
    while the two couples <hi rend="u">H</hi>anne and Sara and
    Kammo and Maryam (1723, no. 38) provided the money for a
    manuscript. In 1706, Shona and her mother Nasrat commissioned a
    Gospel lectionary (no. 29), while in 1744, Amat, her daughter
    Maryam, Helen, Teka, and Elfiya together paid for a manuscript
    that was commissioned by the priest
    <hi rend="sup">c</hi>Abdisho<hi rend="sup">c</hi> from Telkepe (no. 48).<ref target="#FN21">21</ref>� Some
    women made individual donations in other ways: around 1613,
    Shazemana, the wife of Yazdan, donated a �silver cup worth a
    hundred drachmas� and �a house in Sharukhiya� to the church of
    Mar Pethion in Amida (Diarbakir, no. 9), whereas Kanzadeh,
    daughter of the deacon Sulaiman, ransomed a <hi rend="italic">gazza</hi> that
    was looted from the church of Mar Yareth in Barbitha and
    donated it to the church of Mar Shem<hi rend="sup">c</hi>on, Mar
    Giwargis and Ma(r)t Meskinta in Mosul (around 1660, no. 14). So
    far no concrete indications of the price of manuscripts as
    compared with other goods have been found, and only in a few
    instances prices are mentioned, in a variety of different
    currencies.<ref target="#FN22">22</ref>
         </p>
         <p rend="nn">
            <anchor xml:id="P13"/>[13]
    Whereas it seems reasonable to assume that the sums involved
    were quite considerable, especially when women were paying and
    commissioning on their own, there is another indication that
    many of the women in this list did not come from the lower
    strata of the Church-of-the-East communities of the time.
    Although in a considerable number of cases futher details about
    their fathers are lacking, a large number of women appear to
    come from the more important families; many of the fathers are
    priests, and a few are chiefs.<ref target="#FN23">23</ref> Among the husbands, hardly
    any priests are mentioned; the large majority of them come
    without title.<ref target="#FN24">24</ref> Not surprisingly, in the few cases when other
    family members are mentioned (sons, brothers) the number of
    priests or even a patriarch, like the Lady Azdiah, mother of
    Mar Eliya (1738, no. 44) is relatively high.<ref target="#FN25">25</ref> The last case
    also indicates that it is possible that a father or a husband
    was a priest but was not referred to as such in the colophon.
    We know from other sources that Azdiah�s husband, <hi rend="u">H</hi>oshaba son of Giwargis was indeed a priest,
    although the colophon makes no mention of it.<ref target="#FN26">26</ref> Although we do
    not have much to go by to compare the numbers of priests and
    chiefs with the total numbers of men, it is unlikely that these
    would constitute more than fifty percent of the male
    population. It seems safe, therefore, to assume that women from
    priestly and other types of leading families were more likely
    to have some money available and to be involved in manuscript
    production.</p>
         <p rend="nn">
            <anchor xml:id="P14"/>[14] The
    final question to be asked is what was the most likely reason
    for these women to spend money on manuscripts or church
    buildings. Although there is little hard evidence, it seems
    possible that some of these women wanted to possess manuscripts
    for private use within their families or (religious) community.
    The one example of a female scribe, Teresa, daughter of the
    priest Khadjador (1767, no. 53), is the most convincing proof
    that at least some women were able to read, and it is likely
    that she copied the works of John of Damascus for her own
    education. I am inclined to assume that the already mentioned
    �learned girls Tamar and Shmuni�, were able to read the
    miscellaneous work that their father for copied for them,
    including the �Discourse on the monk Mar Shamli� and the �Book
    of the Centuries� (1521, no. 1). The same might be assumed of
    the deaconess Maryam, living in the monastery of Mar Augin, who
    ordered a �Life of Mar Augin� (1739, no. 45).<ref target="#FN27">27</ref> Another book
    that was commissioned for private use was the �Hexaemeron� of
    Rabban Emmanuel (<hi rend="italic">ktābā d-shettat yāumē)</hi>, which the
    daughter of <hi rend="sup">c</hi>Abdisho<hi rend="sup">c</hi> of Alqosh ordered
    �for her brother the priest Yo<hi rend="u">h</hi>anna, to
    read from it� (1701, no. 26). Perhaps also for use within the
    family was the <hi rend="italic">ktābā d-<hi rend="u">h</hi>ermē
    d-na<hi rend="u">tt</hi>urē</hi> (�book of charms of
    protection�), which was ordered by <hi rend="sup">c</hi>I<hi rend="u">s</hi>a and Sanam in 1770 (no. 54).<ref target="#FN28">28</ref>
         </p>
         <p rend="nn">
            <anchor xml:id="P15"/>[15] In
    all other cases we may virtually rule out the possibility that
    manuscripts were commissioned for private use. In fact, it
    seems unlikely that these women (as most of the lay men) were
    able to read at all, since reading skills in general seem to
    have been restricted to the deacons and priests.<ref target="#FN29">29</ref> The colophons,
    however, provide us with two important hints as to the reason
    for commissioning and sponsoring. The first is that the
    majority of the manuscripts are said to have been copied �for�
    a particular church or monastery. That is, if a commissioner,
    sponsor or donor is mentioned, a particular location for the
    manuscripts is usually also given, as in the very first example
    I quoted � Belgan bestowing a manuscript on the church of Mar
    Yo<hi rend="u">h</hi>annan in the village of Dawedaya. The
    large number of such references indicates that this was indeed
    the most important reason for women to commission a
    manuscript.<ref target="#FN30">30</ref> This is also confirmed by the contents of
    these manuscripts. The large majority of these are of a
    liturgical nature and belonged to the essentials of every
    village church: the lectionaries (the Psalter, Gospel
    lectionary, Epistle lectionary, and the <hi rend="italic">ktābā qeryānē
    mparrshē</hi>, i.e. OT and other NT readings),<ref target="#FN31">31</ref> the
    <hi rend="italic">
               <hi rend="u">t</hi>aksā d-kahnē</hi> or the
    <hi rend="italic">
               <hi rend="u">t</hi>aksē d-quddāshā</hi> (the liturgies
    of Addai and Mari, Theodore and Nestorius), and the other
    office books, the <hi rend="italic">ktābā d-<hi rend="u">h</hi>udrā</hi>
    (office book with hymns and other variable parts of the liturgy
    for all Sundays and feast days of the year), the <hi rend="italic">ktābā
    d-gazzā</hi> (later additions to the <hi rend="italic">
               <hi rend="u">h</hi>udrā</hi>), the <hi rend="italic">kashkol</hi> (extract from the
    <hi rend="italic">
               <hi rend="u">h</hi>udrā</hi>),<ref target="#FN32">32</ref> the <hi rend="italic">ktābā
    d-</hi>
            <hi rend="sup">c</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">unyātā,<ref target="#FN33">33</ref>
            </hi> and the liturgies for
    funerals and the Rogation of the Ninevites.<ref target="#FN34">34</ref> Among the books
    dedicated to churches, there are few non-liturgical
    works.<ref target="#FN35">35</ref> Despite the fact that a further interpretation
    of the selection of books that were commissioned and donated is
    still awaiting a study of the larger context of manuscript
    commissioning in this period, there can be little doubt that
    the prime purpose of sponsoring the production of manuscripts
    was to enlarge the number of liturgical books in the churches
    and monasteries of the region, thereby contributing to the
    rebuilding of church life in the Ottoman period. The Gospel
    lectionary and the office books of the <hi rend="italic">
               <hi rend="u">h</hi>udrā</hi> and <hi rend="italic">gazzā</hi> were the most popular
    contributions, presumably because these were considered the
    most important books of the regular Sunday liturgy.</p>
         <p rend="nn">
            <anchor xml:id="P16"/>[16] I
    assume, therefore, that it is first and foremost religious
    devotion that inspired these generous donations made by the
    women of the colophons. These women, like the men that were
    involved in the commissioning and production of the
    manuscripts, must have believed that such material support to
    the life of the church constituted an essential act of piety,
    which would benefit them here and in eternal life. One of the
    few colophons to give us some information on this
    subject<ref target="#FN36">36</ref> is the one about Kanzadeh who redeemed a
    manuscript from robbers (around 1660, no. 14). Of her the
    scribe says: �May Christ our Lord and God give her reward and
    repay her hundred to one, and let her inheritance be with
    Martha and Maryam and with all the companions of the virgins
    and the just and righteous women, Amen.�<ref target="#FN37">37</ref> A similar phrase
    refers to Alpo in 1808: �may Christ give her an inheritance
    with Sara, I say, Ripqa and Rachel [�] and with all the holy
    righteous women, Amen.� (no. 59).<ref target="#FN38">38</ref> In at least two cases, the
    donation is given in connection with a deceased person: the
    first by Dormlik, daughter of Harun of Nisibis, who donated a
    Gospel lectionary to the church of Mar Ya<hi rend="sup">c</hi>qub in
    Nisibis �on behalf of her late husband Darwish� (1569, no. 5),
    the second in a manuscript that was commissioned by
    <hi rend="u">H</hi>anna, son of <hi rend="sup">c</hi>Abd Allah, his
    wife <hi rend="u">H</hi>ane, daughter of Maqsud, and their
    relatives Kanun, <hi rend="sup">c</hi>Isa, Jem<hi rend="sup">c</hi>a, and
    Hormizd, to commemorate the death of Hanna and Hane�s son
    <hi rend="sup">c</hi>Abd al-Masi<hi rend="u">h</hi> on 25 August
    1726, for the church of Mart Maryam in Karamlish (1727, no.
    40). It is likely that such donations were supposed to secure
    peace after death for the deceased, as one might also from two
    inscriptions in which the phrase �may the Lord give her rest�
    occurs.<ref target="#FN39">39</ref> Apart from the spiritual benefits centering on
    the expectation of blissful life after death, it seems likely
    that immediate social benefits also resulted from generous
    contributions to the life of the church. The mere fact that
    these acts of piety were recorded in the manuscripts or on the
    church walls indicates that public knowledge and recognition of
    these gifts constituted an essential part of the economy of
    giving.</p>
         <p rend="nn">
            <anchor xml:id="P17"/>[17] The
    above overview of some of the most salient features of women�s
    presence in the literary remains of the years between 1500 and
    1830 indicates that women, especially those from the more
    influential and literate families, took an active part in the
    religious life of the era. Not only did a significant number of
    them choose to live a celibate, religious life, and do we know
    of a few that were able to read and contribute to the religious
    literature of the time, many others contributed to the
    reawakening of the life of the church by paying for repairs of
    churches and monasteries, by donating money or land to the
    church, and, most importantly, by commissioning and sponsoring
    liturgical manuscripts that were essential to the worship-life
    of the church of this region. In this way they not only sought
    to secure religious benefits for themselves or their kin, they
    also confirmed the importance of their role in the community as
    a whole.<ref target="#FN40">40</ref>
         </p>
         <p rend="nn">
            <anchor xml:id="P18"/>[18] The
    study of the colophons raises one more important issue, that of
    the literary genre of the colophons themselves. The colophons
    constitute the largest body of Classical Syriac texts of this
    period,<ref target="#FN41">41</ref> but so far they have been studied and edited
    mainly from a strictly historical point of view: what names,
    dates and incidents are referred to. The literary genre of the
    colophons with its flowery language of praise and humility, as
    well as the colophons� possible function in the social and
    ecclesiastical structures of the times have hardly been
    considered worthy of separate attention. It seems to me that a
    verbatim edition of the colophons would help us to expand our
    knowledge of the period considerably, not only in the field of
    Classical Syriac linguistics and literary forms, but also in
    the field of the religious life of the Church of the East.</p>

            traditionalist center), appealed for Cardinal Caraffa�s
            help in recovering� the hospice (probably the monastery
            of Mart Maryam) in Jerusalem, that had been
            �appropriated by a rich East Syrian woman, probably a
            traditionalist, �who had the ear of the Turk��.�
            Whether the woman appropriated (bought?) the hospice
            for her own use or for the use of the non-uniate
            community in Jerusalem is uncertain.</item>

            <ref target="#FNRef2">2</ref> The appendix contains a list of women�s names taken
    from the primarily Syriac colophons in MSS. written by Church
    of the East copyists between 1500 and 1830. The list is gleaned
    from David Wilmshurst�s list of colophons of Syriac
    manuscripts, in <hi rend="italic">The Ecclesiastical Organisation of the
    Church of the East, 1318-1913,</hi> CSCO vol. 582, Subsidia 104
    (Louvain: Peeters, 2000). When the catalogues were available to
    me and provided extra information on the women and the MSS.,
    such information has been added. Note that Wilmshurst did not
    include the Arabic MSS. produced by Church of the East writers
    in this period. Note also that my timeframe is considerably
    shorter than that of Wilmshurst, who covers the period from
    1318 to 1913. I have limited myself to the �Ottoman period�,
    but with the exclusion of most of the nineteenth century,
    because of the largely different circumstances (considerable
    western influence) and abundance of sources from about 1830
    onwards. <ref target="#FNRef2">

    Although he seems to have taken into account all manuscripts
    that are described in the catalogues, the often rather concise
    way in which the MS. colophons are edited suggests that a study
    of the MSS. itself would yield additional information. <ref target="#FNRef3">

            <ref target="#FNRef12">12</ref> The presence of these different types of
    religious women raises some issues that cannot be adequately
    treated in this article. One is the apparent survival of the
    earlier offices of both �deaconess� and �daughter of the
    covenant�, although we learn next to nothing about the content
    of these offices (on these in the early days, see S. Harvey
    Ashbrook, �Women�s Service in Ancient Syriac Christianity�, in

    Women according to Eastern Canon Law</hi> (Egling: Edition
    Roman Kovar, 2000, p. 226-241). The other interesting issue is
    the possibility that the nun Shmuni was involved in the early
    stages of the Chaldean monastic movement, initiated in 1808 by
    Gabriel Danbo in Alqosh; cf. S. Bello, <hi rend="italic">La congregation de
    S. Hormisdas et l��glise chald�enne dans la premi�re moiti� du

            <ref target="#FNRef29">29</ref> To what extent women (including religious
    women) in this period were able to read is difficult to
    ascertain. The missionaries in Urmia believed that in the early
    nineteenth century only the sister of the patriarch, Helena,
    could read, cf. Justin Perkins, <hi rend="italic">Missionary Life in Persia:
    being glimpses of a quarter of a century of labors among the
    Nestorian Christians</hi> (Andover: Allen, Morill &amp;
    Wardwell, 1863), 10. However, it is possible that it was not
    always widely known when women were able to read, whereas it is
    also possible that in the Alqosh region literacy among women
    was higher than in the Urmi region. In general, considering the
    fact that priests and deacons were able to read, one should not
    be surprised to encounter some degree of literacy among their
    daughters as well as their sons. <ref target="#FNRef29">

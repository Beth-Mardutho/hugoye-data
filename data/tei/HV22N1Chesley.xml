            <p xml:lang="en">This paper summarizes the results of an extensive test of Tesseract
                4.0, an open-source Optical Character Recognition (OCR) engine with Syriac
                capabilities, and ascertains the current state of Syriac OCR technology. Three
                popular print types (S14, W64, and E22) representing the Syriac type styles
                Estrangela, Serto, and East Syriac were OCRed using Tesseract’s two different OCR
                modes (Syriac Language and Syriac Script). Handwritten manuscripts were also
                preliminarily tested for OCR. The tests confirm that Tesseract 4.0 may be relied
                upon for printed Estrangela texts but should be used with caution and human revision
                for Serto and East Syriac printed texts. Consonantal accuracy lies around 99% for
                Estrangela, between 89% and 94% for Serto, and around 89% for East Syriac. Scholars
                may use Tesseract to OCR Estrangela texts with a high degree of confidence, but
                further training of the engine will be required before Serto and East Syriac texts
                can be smoothly OCRed. In all type styles, human revision of the OCRed text is
                recommended when scholars desire an exact, error-free corpus. </p>

                            This research was conducted under digital humanities fellowships offered
                            in 2018 at Beth Mardutho: The Syriac Institute. The authors wish to
                            thank Dr. George A. Kiraz for his guidance, refining thought, and
                            bestowal of the research opportunity. They also wish to thank the three

                    draft.</p></note>
                <p xml:lang="en">Digital humanities scholars are constantly searching for
                    automatable processes that will free up time for deeper analysis. One such
                    process, optical character recognition (OCR), has dramatically expanded
                    scholars’ ability to search, cross-reference, and analyze large corpora. But
                    while OCR capabilities for Western languages have been in advanced stages for
                    some time, Syriac OCR remains in development, and Syriac scholars have not yet
                    analyzed the accuracy of available OCR engines. To rectify said lacuna, a team
                    of analysts carried out extensive tests on Tesseract 4.0, an open-source OCR
                    engine with Syriac capabilities. This paper summarizes the test results in order
                    to provide data-based recommendations for current Syriac OCR possibilities.</p>
                <p xml:lang="en"> This project evaluated three popular print types (S14, W64, and
                    E22) representing the Syriac type styles Estrangela, Serto, and East Syriac and
                    tested a representative sample of each type style against both modes available
                    for Syriac in Tesseract, Syriac Language and Syriac Script.<note place="foot"
                        xml:id="ftn2" n="2"><p xml:lang="en"> A brief note on terminology
                            used throughout the paper is in order: the term “font” denotes a
                            computer font such as the Meltho fonts. The term “print type” is used to
                            denote the physical type that corresponds to its code in J. F. Coakley’s
                                <hi rend="italic">Typography of Syriac</hi>. For instance, the
                            Meltho font Serto Jerusalem is based on the print type W11B.</p><p
                            rend="footnote text">When the Tesseract OCR engine is invoked, it takes
                            the “-l” (for language) command-line argument. The language value
                            typically matches the ISO 639-2 3-letter code (e.g., “syr” for Syriac)
                            but is in reality the name given to the trained data in Tesseract’s
                            “tessdata” subfolder.</p></note> After briefly summarizing the history
                    of Syriac OCR ventures, this paper details the testing methodology, presents the
                    detailed data results, and finally highlights the most significant errors and
                    trends across type styles. The analysts also briefly tested six handwritten
                    manuscript pages for comparison with the printed pages; the results of these
                    tests follow those for the printed texts.</p>
                <p xml:lang="en"> The project’s extensive tests of Tesseract 4.0 confirmed that this
                    OCR engine may be relied upon for printed Estrangela texts but should be used
                    with caution and human revision for Serto and East Syriac printed texts.
                    Consonantal accuracy lies around 99% for Estrangela, between 89% and 94% for
                    Serto, and around 89% for East Syriac. When diacritics, punctuation, and
                    non-Syriac characters are taken into consideration, accuracy rates drop
                    dramatically: around 95% for Estrangela, approximately 86% for Serto, and around
                    77% for East Syriac.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn3" n="3"><p
                            rend="footnote text"> As will later be explained, every type style was
                            OCRed with two modes, hence the results averaged here. Precise
                            calculations follow.</p></note> Scholars may use Tesseract to OCR
                    Estrangela texts with a high degree of confidence, but further training of the
                    engine will be required before Serto and East Syriac texts may be easily OCRed.
                    In the latter two type styles, Tesseract may still be helpful for the first step
                    of a project, but scholars will have to carefully review and edit all texts to
                    ensure precision and readability. Serto’s OCR accuracy would likely be improved
                    by training Tesseract on a font based on the W64 print type. Handwritten
                    manuscripts are recognized with even less accuracy and demand extensive digital
                    editing, so Tesseract is not recommended for use on manuscripts at this
                    time.</p>
                <p xml:lang="en"> In order to comprehend the tests that were conducted, it is
                    essential to clarify at the outset a technical distinction within Tesseract’s
                    computation and the terms used to describe it. Tesseract can be invoked in two
                    Syriac modes: Language and Script. The former makes use of language-specific
                    training data for OCR. The user can use this mode to recognize texts in English,
                    German, or French, for example. The latter is script wide (e.g., the Latin
                    script) and is not sensitive to a specific language. Having said that, according
                    to the Tesseract user documentation, when one invokes it in Script mode, English
                    is always added to the mix.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn4" n="4"><p

                    While the Tesseract engine remains the same, its two modes OCR with slightly
                    different tools and thus produce differing results. The tests accounted for the
                    mode variable, and results will be reported in both modes. Since the term
                    “script” can also refer in Syriac studies to the three Syriac scripts
                    (Estrangela, Serto and East Syriac), the analysts have opted in this paper to
                    use the phrase “type style” to refer to the three Syriac scripts and the
                    capitalized word “Script” to refer to the Tesseract mode. In order to simplify
                    terms, this paper refers to the six variable combinations of type style and mode
                    in hyphenated form, e.g., as Estrangela-Language.</p>
                <p xml:lang="en"> This lengthy paper contains overall results, results split by type
                    style, analysis of the significant error trends, manuscripts results, practical
                    tips, and concluding remarks. Reading the work in full will give the best
                    understanding of the project and its conclusions; however, readers can still
                    gain valuable information from focusing on certain parts of the paper. For those
                    readers who prefer data to prose, tables and graphs are included throughout the
                    paper and especially in Appendix 2. For scholars who have a specific Syriac text
                    or project in mind, this paper highlights the results by type style (Estrangela,
                    Serto, and East Syriac) and analyzes the most significant accuracy difficulties
                    in each; these results will help those scholars understand if and how Tesseract
                    can best assist them in their task. For those readers who are interested in
                    handwritten texts, there is a section on manuscript results. The methodology of
                    the project as well as the tips for usage will provide some practical advice for
                    OCRing Syriac, though there are practical insights throughout the paper as well. </p>

                    <head>2. HISTORY OF SYRIAC OCR</head>
                    <p xml:lang="en">Syriac optical character recognition (OCR) has been sought
                        since the early 1990s. OCR is the electronic conversion of typeset or
                        handwritten text images into machine-encoded texts; the process turns an
                        unsearchable image of a text into a searchable text file. As one can
                        imagine, effective OCR drastically speeds up the process of searching and
                        analyzing large sets of text. Syriac OCR will thus allow for the creation of
                        virtual text corpora on par with, for example, the <hi rend="italic"
                            >Thesaurus Linguae Graecae</hi>.</p>
                    <p xml:lang="en"> The primary hindrance to creating an OCR engine for Syriac has
                        always been its cursive nature of writing, since the script prevents precise
                        letter differentiation.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn5" n="5"><p

                        was first tackled, to the best of the team’s knowledge, by William Clocksin
                        in the early 1990s, then a faculty member at the Computer Lab of the
                        University of Cambridge. In collaboration with students, Clocksin developed
                        an OCR system for hand-written Estrangela and reported high success rates of
                        up to 100% accuracy.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn7" n="7"><p

                        particular language by feeding it images of that language and their
                        corresponding transcriptions. With this training method, it learns how to
                        recognize letters from this training data and then becomes able to recognize
                        images of other texts in that language it has not seen before. Tesseract 4.0
                        already supports Syriac in all its type styles (i.e., Estrangela, Serto, and
                        East Syriac). </p>
                    <p xml:lang="en"> The team’s preliminary question, before analyzing Tesseract’s
                        output, was: how was Tesseract trained and on what sort of data? In the
                        absence of any documentation from Tesseract’s programmers, the team
                        considered two options: either a large set of texts was transcribed and fed
                        into Tesseract with its associated text images or an automated method was
                        used to produce text images and their corresponding texts.<note place="foot"

                                accessed 30 July, 2018. </p></note> The former option seemed
                        unlikely since the Syriac world is a small one; if the hundreds of thousands
                        of lines that are required for thorough training had been transcribed from
                        books by a Syriac scholar, the Syriac community would presumably have heard
                        about this endeavor. The team then began to investigate whether another
                        mechanical method could have been used for training. Inverting the process,
                        one can use a font to generate a huge amount of texts, say in a PDF format,
                        and then convert the PDFs into images of individual pages. Since the Syriac
                        content and the images that correspond to them are both known, the compiled
                        data can be used to train Tesseract on which shapes represent which
                        characters. Searching internet archives unearthed web pages which indicated
                        that Beth Mardutho’s Meltho fonts may have been used for just such a
                            task.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn12" n="12"><p xml:lang="en">

                            </p></note> To verify this assumption, the analysts produced a PDF from
                        the non-standard, calligraphic Meltho font Estrangelo TurAbdin, which was
                        based on the calligraphy of Isa Benjamin and does not appear in any print
                        edition. Estrangelo TurAbdin is an elaborately swirled and decorated font,
                        too unique to be recognized without intentional training, yet Tesseract had
                        no problems recognizing the characters produced by it. This demonstrates
                        that Tesseract was indeed trained with Beth Mardutho’s Meltho fonts and not
                        by manual transcriptions of texts. </p>

                        types were chosen for OCRing. The Estrangela and Serto texts are unvocalized

                        vocalized in text editions. East Syriac, on the other hand, tends to be
                        vocalized in many text editions. Several pages from each text were scanned
                        at 300 dpi in black and white and cropped in order to generate images that
                        only included the main body of the text, thus excluding marginal notes and

                                order to check the outputs against each other. Tesseract 4.0 was
                                downloaded from the GitHub page maintained by the Mannheim

                        images, each one page of the text, for Estrangela (S14), Serto (W64), and
                        East Syriac (E22). Each image, in turn, was OCRed using both Syriac language
                        modes for Tesseract (command-line arguments “-l Syr” and “-l script/Syriac”
                        for Syriac Language and Syriac Script, respectively). Given the potential
                        differences in outcome between these two modes, it was essential that
                        Tesseract be tested separately with both options. Part of the project’s goal
                        was to determine how similar or divergent the two modes are and to determine
                        which one produces the most accurate OCR results in each Syriac type style.
                        This double testing thus produced 18 OCRed documents, 6 for each type style,
                        which were analyzed concerning their accuracy. The team analyzed 84 lines of
                        Estrangela, 45 lines of Serto, and 66 lines of East Syriac in each mode.</p>

                                was selecting multiple output file types at once. When executing the
                                Tesseract command-line arguments, one must choose a file kind for
                                output; selecting “txt” generates the OCR as a .txt file, and so
                                forth. However, one can choose to generate multiple file kinds at
                                once by entering all codes into the same command-line argument. For
                                the most part, the OCR text that results from multi-output functions
                                is identical to those generated by single-output functions. However,
                                sometimes a multi-output function generated gibberish. For example,
                                a page in Serto was run through Tesseract with the Script
                                command-line argument and with an output of “txt pdf hocr,” and one
                                of the resultant lines was: “bs avwnE vrtwAUM oa airog + <foreign xml:lang="syr">ܙܝܐ</foreign> ‎ eTB NA Kota)
                                CApeTtoLG ®.” This was by no means a common occurrence, and the team
                                did not find the same problem repeated with other Serto images or in
                                other type styles, which suggests that researchers need not
                                anticipate an error like this happening frequently. That being said,
                                running one output file kind at a time ensures the most accurate OCR
                                of one’s image.</p></note> Timing and particular computer used were
                        additional variables, the impact of which the analysts did not initially
                        know. In order to confirm the consistency of Tesseract, every OCRed image
                        was later re-OCRed by the same analyst and with the same set of command
                        line-arguments to confirm that identical results would be generated. Several
                        days later, a different analyst re-OCRed images processed by her colleagues
                        on the other computer and input the same command-line arguments. The re-OCR
                        process consistently produced texts that were identical in content (i.e.,
                        Syriac letters, diacritics, Roman letters, and Arabic characters) when the
                        same image was run with the same commands. These quality control steps
                        suggest that timing and hardware do not interfere with the Tesseract engine;
                        these conclusions, in turn, allow the team to assume that its analysis
                        applies broadly to Tesseract as an engine and not merely to individual
                        analysts or machines.</p>

                        counted and averaged, and that average was then used to estimate character
                        counts for the whole page.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn30" n="30"><p

                                Analysts could leave the Estrangela font or change fonts to match

                        occurrences were recorded as distinct errors. This allowed more precision in
                        data analysis later. Over the course of the project, it is likely that each
                        analyst reviewed her six pages more than five times, rechecking data and
                        pulling information on specific issues. These reviews were often prompted by

                        even more specifically than originally intended. Though tedious, the process
                        allowed the analysts to identify the most common errors within Tesseract

                        occurred. Having a record of all errors produced also provided a wider

                        accuracy. Accuracy, simply stated, is the inverse of error rate; accuracy
                        was calculated by subtracting the error rate from one. For most data points,
                        the error rate is understood as the total errors<note place="foot"

                                resulting errors than characters in the original image. The
                                characters that were added cause this problem. Some accuracy rates
                                could not be calculated due to the lack of certain characters (e.g.,
                                non-Syriac characters) in the original. </p></note> Accuracy was

                        calculated for each individual page, for each Tesseract mode of operation

                        Syriac), and each Syriac type style as a whole (averaging results for both
                        modes). Additionally, errors and their respective accuracy rates involving
                        certain letters were considered, specifically when a letter in the original
                        became a different character or disappeared in the resulting document.<note

                            predominate kinds of errors, which combinations of type styles and
                            Tesseract modes were most accurate for which kinds of letters, and what
                            were the overall accuracy rates scholars could expect with the current
                            version of Tesseract. The project further sought to identify important
                            areas for future training of the Tesseract engine. Analysis began with
                            the most detailed descriptions of errors possible and grouped error
                            types into increasingly broader categories. At the most narrow level,
                            the analysts considered categories such as <hi rend="italic">ayn</hi>
                            becoming <hi rend="italic">ḥ</hi><hi rend="italic">éth</hi> in East
                            Syriac-Script, which only occurred once across all three pages. At the
                            broadest level, the test tabulated total percentage of consonant errors
                            compared across all six combinations of type style and Tesseract mode.
                            The team also attempted to evaluate the impact of other factors such as
                            pixel size and image quality on the OCR results. The section that
                            follows details the specific results for each type style, subdivided
                            into discussions of consonants, diacritics, punctuation, and non-Syriac

                            of which were repeated across other pages and some of which were unique
                            to one page—and sometimes unique to one instance. Though the analysts
                            made great effort to be diligent and consistent in their individual work
                            and as a team, human error must be acknowledged as a reality in any
                            project that relies on human eyes. That being said, the pages studied
                            and the resulting data were discussed and reexamined multiple times to
                            give the team confidence in the data presented here.<note place="foot"

                                    tables of individual data, it was observed that there was no
                                    consistent pattern that would indicate a strong distinction
                                    between the analyst’s data. For example, no one analyst
                                    consistently had the lowest or highest accuracy rates. The lack
                                    of pattern speaks to the consistent method of data collection
                                    across each of the three analysts.</p></note> The analysts were
                            also randomly assigned to review different variables from the other
                            analysts’ data.</p>
                        <p xml:lang="en"> The individual data was analyzed to determine the range of
                            the data set as well as the variety of accuracy rates within the pages.
                            Most of the data given in this paper is based on the averages of the
                            three analysts’ work, as this gives the best overall picture of the
                            results and compensates for human error. However, the range and standard
                            deviation between individual data gave the team a deeper understanding
                            of the underlying data points, and these are provided in tables in <ref
                                target="#Individual_Page_Information">Appendix 2</ref>. For the most
                            part, the data remained reasonably close between analysts; consonant
                            accuracy rates only have ranges of one to four percent, while the ranges
                            of total accuracy rates do not reach six percent. Diacritic accuracy
                            rates, on the other hand, vary greatly between individual pages. For
                            example, the ranges within the data for the Estrangela and Serto texts
                            in Script mode hovered around 55%.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn42"

                            unvocalized, meaning that in terms of diacritics they contained only
                            homograph dots and <hi rend="italic">syomés</hi>. In Language mode, only
                            45.45% of these diacritics were recognized correctly, and in Script
                            mode, only 32.17% were recognized correctly. The most frequently
                            occurring error was the diacritic homograph dot being substituted for
                            another kind of diacritic. It was most often rendered as one of the very
                            similar-looking dotted vowels, but was also occasionally misidentified
                            as a Greek vowel, an Arabic diacritic, or a <hi rend="italic"
                            >syomé</hi>. The second most common error was the homograph dot being
                            missed or added, which happened 14 times in Language and 32 times in
                            Script.</p>

                            addition or omission of punctuation, which happened 12 times in Language
                            and 11 times in Script. There were also three occurrences where a Syriac
                            punctuation mark was recognized as an Arabic diacritic—for example, the

                        <p xml:lang="en">There were 21 non-Syriac characters in the Estrangela pages
                            tested, consisting of asterisks and superscript numbers. None of these
                            characters was recognized accurately by Tesseract, and the errors
                            involving these non-Syriac characters were very inconsistent. For
                            example, on one page there were ten superscripted Arabic digits (i.e.,
                            1, 2, 3) identifying footnotes.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn47" n="47"
                                    ><p xml:lang="en"> Estrangela Page 1.</p></note> Nine of
                            these numbers were rendered as other characters—one as an asterisk,
                            three as double quotation marks, four as single apostrophes, and one as
                            an exclamation point.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn48" n="48"><p
                                    rend="footnote text"> Intriguingly, the number that was
                                    recognized as an exclamation point was the digit 8, not a 7 or a
                                    1 as one might assume based on similarity of character
                                    shapes.</p></note> Only one numeral was recognized correctly,
                            but Tesseract did not recognize that it was superscripted and instead
                            placed it on the main line of text. Interestingly, two asterisks were
                            rendered as double quotation marks, despite Tesseract evidently having
                            an asterisk in its training module. Running English Language or Latin
                            Script modes at the same time as Syriac did not improve the recognition
                            of these characters, only resulting in an increased number of Syriac
                            characters recognized as Latin characters (e.g., Estrangela <hi
                                rend="italic">hé</hi> recognized as Latin <hi rend="italic"
                            >m</hi>).</p>
                        <p xml:lang="en"> Attentive readers may be perplexed by the negative
                            percentages in this category: they are caused by Tesseract’s addition of
                            non-Syriac characters which were not present in the original images.
                            This occurred in Script mode on only two occasions, but these two
                            additions had a notable effect on the accuracy rate because of the small
                            number of non-Syriac characters on the original pages.</p>

                        <p xml:lang="en"> The most common issue in Serto was the addition of extra
                            letters, particularly the tooth letters <hi rend="italic">yudh</hi>, <hi
                                rend="italic">ayn</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">ḥ</hi><hi
                                rend="italic">éth</hi>. This was common in both Language and Script
                            mode but occurred twice as many times in Script mode. This is discussed
                            in more detail in the Analysis section under <hi rend="Hyperlink"><seg

                                >olaph</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">béth</hi> were also incorrectly
                            added to the text fairly frequently. <hi rend="italic">Waw</hi> and <hi
                                rend="italic">olaph</hi> were inserted more times in Script mode,
                            while <hi rend="italic">dolath-rish</hi> was inserted more often in
                            Language mode, and <hi rend="italic">béth</hi> was inserted an almost
                            equal number of times in both modes.</p>
                        <p xml:lang="en"> After the addition of consonants, misidentification of
                            consonants was the second most common cause of errors. Certain
                            consonants, when misidentified, were misidentified consistently. For
                            instance, when Tesseract misidentified a <hi rend="italic">Ṣodhé</hi>,
                            it was always substituted with a <hi rend="italic">dolath</hi>.
                            Similarly, on all the occasions that <hi rend="italic">taw </hi>was
                            misidentified, it was recognized as an <hi rend="italic">olaph</hi>.
                            Other consonantal substitutions were not completely consistent but still
                            showed a tendency towards a particular letter. For example, <hi
                                rend="italic">shin </hi>was most likely to be misidentified as <hi
                                rend="italic">phé</hi>, which accounted for seven out of the nine
                            substitution errors in Language and both of the substitution errors in
                            Script. <hi rend="italic">Hé</hi> was most frequently misidentified as a
                                <hi rend="italic">waw</hi> in both modes, and in Script it was also
                            frequently mistaken for a <hi rend="italic">zayn</hi> and <hi
                                rend="italic">waw</hi> together, which in Serto type style creates a
                            very similar shape to <hi rend="italic">hé</hi>. <hi rend="italic"
                                >Yudh</hi> was mistaken for a <hi rend="italic">ḥ</hi><hi
                                rend="italic">éth</hi> 11 out of the 16 times it was misidentified
                            and, likewise, all nine times <hi rend="italic">ḥ</hi><hi rend="italic"
                                >éth</hi> was misidentified it was mistaken for one or two <hi
                                rend="italic">yudhs</hi>. The remaining two consonants that were
                            frequently misidentified, <hi rend="italic">mim</hi> and <hi
                                rend="italic">dolath-rish</hi>, showed more variation in their
                            substitutions, with the 13 <hi rend="italic">mim</hi> substitutions
                            occurring across ten distinct error categories and the ten <hi
                                rend="italic">dolath-rish</hi> substitutions occurring in eight
                            distinct error categories.</p>
                        <p xml:lang="en"> Table 10 shows the accuracy rate of each consonant in
                            Serto in both Language and Script modes. The majority of consonants
                            achieved over 97% accuracy in both Serto modes. However, when compared
                            with Estrangela, Serto's numbers become less praiseworthy. Serto has an
                            average of eight consonants performing at lower-than-97% accuracy, while
                            Estrangela only has one that falls below this threshold. Moreover,
                            certain consonants in Serto had a significantly low accuracy rate.
                                <hi>Ṣ</hi><hi rend="italic">odhé, </hi>for example, proved
                            particularly difficult for Tesseract to recognize. Also illustrated by
                            the table is the fact that the two modes can produce extremely varied
                            accuracy ratings for the same letter. For example, <hi rend="italic"
                                >ḥ</hi><hi rend="italic">éth</hi>, <hi rend="italic">taw</hi>, and
                                <hi rend="italic">mim</hi> were over 10% more accurate in Language
                            mode, whereas <hi rend="italic">shin </hi>was 19% more accurate in
                            Script mode. </p>

                        <p xml:lang="en">As with Estrangela, the Serto pages tested were
                            unvocalized, meaning that the images’ only diacritics were homograph
                            dots and <hi rend="italic">syomés</hi>. Of all three type styles tested,
                            Tesseract produced the least accurate results for diacritics in Serto,
                            with only a 22.52% accuracy rate for diacritics in Language mode and a
                            16.56% accuracy rate for diacritics in Script mode. These figures
                            include a high number of diacritics that were incorrectly added by
                            Tesseract, many of which the analysts believe were caused by stray marks
                            in the original images.</p>
                        <p xml:lang="en"> Table 11 lists the seven different types of diacritic
                            errors recorded for Serto and gives their frequency in Language mode and
                            Script mode. The homograph dot was the locus of most Serto diacritic
                            errors; it was frequently added, deleted, or substituted. When the
                            homograph dot was misidentified it was most often substituted for a
                            dotted vowel, as was also the case in Estrangela.</p>

                            of punctuation, accounting for about 73% of punctuation errors in both
                            Language and Script. The remaining errors involved punctuation being

                            East Syriac text in both modes was word truncation, a problem resulting
                            from segmentation issues. This caused Tesseract to omit 80 consonants in
                            Language and 82 in Script. Tesseract also omitted many individual
                            consonants from within words that had otherwise been recognized. The
                            most commonly omitted consonants were <hi rend="italic">olaph</hi>, <hi
                                rend="italic">dolath-rish</hi>, <hi rend="italic">nun</hi>, and <hi

                            commonly misidentified consonants, they were also the consonants that
                            others were most frequently substituted for. This issue is discussed in
                            more detail in the Analysis section. Another frequently substituted
                            consonant was <hi rend="italic">ṭ</hi><hi rend="italic">éth, </hi>which
                            was substituted for a <hi rend="italic">gomal</hi> on every occasion
                            that it was misidentified. </p>
                        <p xml:lang="en"> Table 15 gives the accuracy rate for each individual
                            consonant in East Syriac. Tesseract was less than 97% accurate at
                            recognizing the majority of consonants in both modes. The letters <hi
                                rend="italic">dolath-rish</hi>, <hi rend="italic">ṭ</hi><hi
                                rend="italic">éth</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">zayn</hi> posed
                            particular difficulty for Tesseract in East Syriac type style. The table

                            consonants between the two modes. <hi rend="italic">Zayn </hi>is 50%
                            more accurate in Language and <hi rend="italic">béth</hi> is 11% more
                            accurate in Language, while <hi rend="italic">Ṣ</hi><hi rend="italic"

                            oblique lines (Unicode character U+0747). Tesseract recognized the
                            diacritics in East Syriac most accurately out of the three type styles
                            tested, but the accuracy rate was still very low, with a 60.69% rate of
                            accuracy in Language and a 53.17% rate of accuracy in Script. </p>

                            errors in East Syriac are likely due to the high frequency of vowel
                            pointings in East Syriac to begin with. The three pages tested had a
                            total of 1,239 original diacritics. The more diacritics there are and
                            the more <hi rend="italic">kinds </hi>of diacritics there are, the more
                            opportunities Tesseract has to misread the image.<note place="foot"

                                    Syriac’s many diacritical marks invade the white space between
                                    lines and thus create difficulties in distinguishing words.
                                    Besides affecting Tesseract’s segmentation, this may also
                                    contribute to misidentified diacritics.</p></note> By the same
                            token, because East Syriac has so many more diacritics than the other
                            type styles, Tesseract has far more chances to read them correctly.
                            Tesseract can have 487 errors and 579 diacritical errors in East
                            Syriac-Language and -Script, respectively, yet still achieve the highest
                            percentage of diacritic accuracy of all three type styles tested.</p>

                        <p xml:lang="en">Tesseract’s two most frequent diacritic errors involved the
                            dotted vowel. Dotted vowels (e.g., <foreign xml:lang="syr">ܲ</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="syr">ܵ</foreign> ) were likely to be
                            deleted or added, and they were also occasionally rendered as Greek
                            vowels (e.g., <foreign xml:lang="syr">ܰ</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="syr">ܶ</foreign>). When this switch from
                            dotted vowel to Greek vowel occurred, the dotted vowels were usually
                            rendered as the equivalent Greek vowel and were rendered as a
                            non-equivalent Greek vowel roughly half as many times.<note place="foot"
                                xml:id="ftn52" n="52"><p xml:lang="en"> There were 1,239
                                    original diacritics in the pages tested. Dotted vowels were
                                    rendered as their equivalent Greek vowel 51 times in Language
                                    and 81 times in Script, and dotted vowels were rendered as a
                                    non-equivalent Greek vowel 23 times in Language and 43 times in
                                    Script. These two vowel shifts account for 15.20% and 21.42% of
                                    diacritic errors in Language and Script, respectively. The shift
                                    from dotted vowel to its equivalent Greek vowel is considered an
                                    error because Tesseract is not representing the original image,
                                    and especially so given that Tesseract was able to correctly
                                    recognize the dotted vowels in some cases confirming that the
                                    engine is capable of exact recognition and
                                reproduction.</p></note> This was true for both modes. This
                            indicates that Tesseract has at least some training in recognizing that
                            East Syriac dotted vowels are, in fact, vowels and in distinguishing
                            them from punctuation marks or homograph dots. This also implies that
                            Tesseract was trained on texts that included Greek vowels.</p>

                <p xml:lang="en">While the OCR testing generated a long list of errors, some of
                    which were unique, trends are still discernible in the data. The following pages
                    detail major error trends that emerged from the Tesseract testing data. Tooth
                    letters had statistically significant error rates across all type styles,
                    especially in terms of addition and substitution errors. Other kinds of errors
                    were perceived primarily in one type style; examples of this were <hi
                        rend="italic">dolath</hi> and <hi rend="italic">rish</hi> in East Syriac,
                        <hi rend="italic">mim</hi> in Serto, and <hi rend="italic">yudh</hi> in
                    Serto. Additional subsections consider unique errors, segmentation issues, and
                    spacing issues as examples of what scholars can expect to find in their OCR
                    ventures. Along with summarizing each of these common error trends, the paper
                    analyzes what factors from letter shape to OCR training caused these tendencies. </p>
                <p xml:lang="en"> All three type styles differed as to their most common type of
                    error, whether added, deleted, or substituted. While Estrangela-Script had
                    relatively even numbers of all three, Estrangela-Language had significantly more
                    added and deleted letters than substituted. Interestingly, for both Script and
                    Language modes in Estrangela, Tesseract deleted the same number of letters it
                    added. In Serto, added letters were most common in both modes, and deleted
                    letters were least common. In East Syriac-Language, deletions were slightly more
                    common error types than substitutions, but both far outnumbered insertions. In
                    East Syriac-Script, additions remained the least common error type, but
                    substitutions predominated over deletions. </p>

                    three images tested, East Syriac had 22 lines per page, and Serto had an average
                    of 15 lines per page. Thus, Serto differed from the other type styles both in
                    average number of consonants per line (higher) and in average number of lines
                    per page (lower). Serto’s unique typographical features are paralleled in many
                    of its Tesseract testing results. As will soon become clear, Serto exhibited
                    markedly different results from the other type styles in several kinds of
                    errors.</p>

                                Tesseract. Similarly, <hi rend="italic">zayn </hi>is not counted as
                                a tooth letter because it does not connect to the letters on either
                                side, making it uniquely distinguishable.</p></note> All four
                        letters are written connected to letters on either side, and they rise
                        slightly above the line of text. Hence, they are easily confused—by human
                        readers and by computer programs! One of the more frequent error trends in
                        Estrangela and Serto was the rendering of these tooth letters. Tesseract
                        frequently confused one tooth letter for another, added tooth letters
                        (particularly <hi rend="italic">yudhs</hi> in Serto), deleted tooth letters,
                        or recognized other letters as tooth letters and vice versa. As Table 19
                        illustrates, tooth letter errors account for more than 14% of consonantal
                        errors across all six type style-mode combinations. It ranges from 14.10% of
                        consonantal errors in East Syriac-Language to 54.04% of consonantal errors
                        in Serto-Script.</p>

                            different type styles. By far the most common type of tooth letter error
                            in Serto was added tooth letters. East Syriac, on the other hand, had
                            more substitution errors, in which one tooth letter was misread as a
                            different tooth letter, and errors of tooth letter deletion. The types
                            of tooth letter errors were relatively even in Estrangela, with four,
                            eight, and six total substitution, addition, and deletion errors,
                            respectively. </p>
                        <p xml:lang="en"> As Table 20 shows, Tesseract rendered tooth letters with a
                            range of accuracies across the six combinations of type style and mode.
                            Both Estrangela modes had higher than 97% accuracy rates at rendering
                            all four tooth letters, and the two East Syriac modes ranged from 90.61%
                            to 93.01% accurate. Particularly for Estrangela, Tesseract may be relied
                            upon with a high degree of certainty in regard to these four letters
                                (<hi rend="italic">ḥ</hi><hi rend="italic">éth</hi>, <hi
                                rend="italic">yud</hi>, <hi rend="italic">nun</hi>, and <hi
                                rend="italic">ayn</hi>). Serto, on the other hand, performed
                            relatively poorly. Serto-Language generated an 82.96% accuracy rate, and
                            Serto-Script was only 68.17% accurate. </p>

                                rend="italic">yudhs</hi> during the OCR process. Sometimes—though
                            not every time—these appeared to be added when a dot rested above the
                            line of text in the original image, as if Tesseract believed a letter
                            was pushed out of line. The differences between Serto and the other type
                            styles are stark: while East Syriac added only one <hi rend="italic"
                                >yudh</hi> across all six pages tested (the one occurrence was in
                            Script mode) and Estrangela added eight <hi rend="italic">yudhs</hi>,
                            Serto inserted an astounding 41 <hi rend="italic">yudhs</hi> in Language
                            and 84 in Script! This accounts for about 30–35% of consonantal errors
                            in both of Serto’s modes. Consequently, added <hi rend="italic"
                                >yudhs</hi> also account for a large percentage of added tooth
                            letter errors in Estrangela and Serto.</p>
                        <p xml:lang="en"> In Serto-Language and Serto-Script, however, 48 and 111
                            tooth letters were added, respectively. Most of its added tooth letters
                            were <hi rend="italic">yudhs</hi>: Serto’s many added <hi rend="italic"
                                >yudhs</hi> made up 85.42% of added tooth letter errors in Language
                            mode and 75.68% in Script mode. If <hi rend="italic">yudhs</hi> are
                            discounted, Serto only had 7 tooth letter additions in Language and 27
                            in Script. </p>

                        <p xml:lang="en">Given the similar appearances of each tooth letter to
                            another, the analysts anticipated prior to the testing that a high rate
                            of substitution errors would result, wherein one tooth letter (an <hi
                                rend="italic">ayn</hi>, for instance) would be incorrectly
                            recognized as a difference tooth letter (say, a <hi rend="italic"
                                >nun</hi>) by Tesseract. In actuality, Tesseract had a very high
                            accuracy rate in this regard. The least-accurate permutation tested,
                            Serto-Language, still only misidentified 2.01% of tooth letters as other
                            tooth letters. Put another way, while added and deleted tooth letters
                            made up a high percentage of consonantal errors, confusion between
                            letters did not significantly contribute to the error rate. Tesseract
                            thus appears to have a high degree of accuracy in recognizing tooth
                            letters, and evidently other factors cause the added letters.</p>

                            were recognized accurately in both modes, East Syriac had relatively
                            imprecise accuracy rates for these letters: 72.94% in Language and
                            75.23% in Script. Close to 25% of <hi rend="italic">dolaths</hi> and <hi
                                rend="italic">rishes</hi> were incorrectly identified or deleted in
                            each East Syriac mode. This may have to do with the shape of <hi
                                rend="italic">rishes</hi> and <hi rend="italic">dolaths</hi> in the
                            East Syriac font. With their large curved shape, they look similar to
                                <hi rend="italic">waws</hi> and <hi rend="italic">kophs</hi>.
                            Indeed, Tesseract substituted a total of 35 <hi rend="italic"
                                >dolaths</hi> and <hi rend="italic">rishes</hi> for <hi

                                >dolaths</hi> and <hi rend="italic">rishes</hi> for <hi
                                rend="italic">kophs</hi>. Interestingly, the misidentification did
                            not go both ways; on no occasion was a <hi rend="italic">waw</hi>
                            substituted for a <hi rend="italic">dolath</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                                >rish</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">kophs</hi> were very rarely

                                >dolath</hi> (only three total occurrences of this type of error in
                            both East Syriac modes). Tesseract also had some difficulty
                            distinguishing <hi rend="italic">dolaths</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                                >rishes</hi> from each other and from the dotless <hi rend="italic"
                                >dolath-rish</hi> consonantal stem. These were incorrectly
                            substituted amongst themselves 18 times in East Syriac-Language and 11
                            times in East Syriac-Script. </p>

                        <p xml:lang="en"> The East Syriac <hi rend="italic">dolath-rish</hi> also
                            proved problematic for Tesseract in another way. Not only did Tesseract
                            often misidentify <hi rend="italic">dolath-rish</hi> as other
                            consonants, it also frequently mistook other consonants for a <hi
                                rend="italic">dolath</hi> or <hi rend="italic">rish</hi>. After <hi
                                rend="italic">dolath-rish</hi>, the most commonly misidentified
                            consonants in East Syriac were <hi rend="italic">nun</hi>, <hi
                                rend="italic">zayn</hi>, <hi rend="italic">olaph</hi>, and <hi
                                rend="italic">shin</hi>, all of which were most frequently mistaken
                            as <hi rend="italic">dolath-rish</hi>. The affected <hi rend="italic"
                                >nuns</hi> were all medial except one. Perhaps the similar height of
                            the medial <hi rend="italic">nun </hi>compared with the <hi
                                rend="italic">dolath-rish</hi> stem caused this issue. <hi
                                rend="italic">Zayn </hi>and <hi rend="italic">shin </hi>are also
                            similar in height and shape to the <hi rend="italic">dolath-rish</hi>
                            stem. <hi rend="italic">Olaph</hi> stands out as an unusual consonant to
                            be mistaken as <hi rend="italic">dolath-rish</hi>, as it is not similar
                            in height or shape. It is possible that East Syriac’s dotted vowels had
                            an effect in these cases. In Script mode, four out of the five instances
                            in which <hi rend="italic">olaph</hi> was recognized as a <hi
                                rend="italic">dolath</hi> occurred when dotted vowels appeared below
                            the original <hi rend="italic">olaphs</hi>. This indicates that
                            Tesseract’s ability to accurately recognize East Syriac text could be
                            improved by further training focused on distinguishing <hi rend="italic"
                                >dolath-rish</hi> from consonants with similar shapes and further
                            training to distinguish diacritics from <hi rend="italic"
                                >dolath-rish</hi> dots.</p>

                            being very accurately rendered in two type styles but less-accurately so
                            in the third. Estrangela had a nearly 100% accuracy rate in both modes,
                            and East Syriac-Language and -Script were both about 98% accurate.
                            However, Serto-Language was 95.8% accurate, and Serto-Script was 86.55%
                            accurate. The different shape of <hi rend="italic">mims</hi> in Serto
                            likely contributes to Tesseract’s less-accurate performance here. A
                            glance at the kinds of <hi rend="italic">mim</hi> substitution errors
                            across type styles supports this hypothesis: In East Syriac, <hi
                                rend="italic">mims</hi> were mistaken as a <hi rend="italic">qoph
                            </hi>(twice in Script), a <hi rend="italic">phé</hi> (once in Language),
                            and an <hi rend="italic">olaph</hi> (once in Language). In Serto, by
                            contrast, <hi rend="italic">mims</hi> were misidentified with six
                            (different) letters. In Serto-Language, <hi rend="italic">mims</hi> were
                            recognized as a <hi rend="italic">lomadh</hi> (1), a <hi rend="italic"

                            between Serto-Script and the five other Tesseract permutations. A nearly
                            87% accuracy rate is not unsatisfactory, but what makes this error rate
                            so intriguing is the fact that it differs so markedly from the five
                            other type style-mode combinations. What would make Serto <hi

                            but not to the Language mode? While the shape of Serto <hi rend="italic"
                                >mims</hi> seems to be an issue for Tesseract, if shape were the
                            only problematic variable one should expect to see it causing similar

                            have distinct error trends compared with the Estrangela and East Syriac
                            type styles. Tooth letters, particularly <hi rend="italic">yudhs</hi>,
                            were added erroneously in all type styles but at a far higher rate in
                            Serto. Tesseract misread <hi rend="italic">mims</hi> to a higher degree
                            in Serto. Serto had the lowest diacritic accuracy of all three type
                            styles. While stray marks in the Serto images may have contributed to
                            some of these OCR errors, they cannot account for all of Tesseract’s
                            mistakes. Since Serto images had essentially identical resolutions to
                            those in Estrangela and East Syriac, pixel size cannot account for this
                            discrepancy either. </p>
                        <p xml:lang="en"> The most likely explanation for Tesseract’s unusual error
                            patterns in Serto lies at the level of font. The print types tested in
                            this paper were chosen based on popularity—because they were
                            frequently-used print types in each type style. As the analysts
                            discovered partway through the testing project, Tesseract was most
                            assuredly trained on Meltho fonts, and thus, print types closely related
                            to Meltho fonts will perform better with Tesseract. Print types S14 and
                            E22, those tested here for Estrangela and East Syriac, happened to be
                            part of the set of types used as the basis for the Meltho computer
                            fonts. Their closeness in shape to Tesseract’s training modules explains
                            their OCR superiority in these areas. However, the Serto print type
                            tested, W64, was not part of the set of print types upon which Meltho
                            fonts were based, making its letter shapes further from Tesseract’s
                            baseline. By correlation, Tesseract is less able to recognize text
                            printed in W64. This explains much of the broadest level results between
                            Estrangela, East Syriac, and Serto. If Tesseract were trained with a
                            font based on W64, Tesseract’s OCR accuracy with Serto print type would
                            likely improve significantly.</p>

                            was part of the pool of print types underlying the Meltho fonts. How can
                            its low performance be explained? Very simply, as it turns out. The
                            shapes of letters in the East Syriac type style are more similar in
                            shape to one another than the same letters are to each other in Serto

                    <p xml:lang="en">Before Tesseract can properly read the Syriac text it must be
                        able to segment the page correctly into words and lines. One of the telling
                        signs of incorrect segmentation comes from truncated words and missing
                        lines. If Tesseract drops letters at the beginning or end of words,
                        particularly words at the beginning or end of lines, or if entire lines are
                        skipped during the OCR process, then Tesseract most likely did not recognize
                        the correct beginning and ends of word and line gaps. Tesseract is trained
                        to determine word and line divisions based on white spaces. So, if many
                        punctuation marks fill spaces between words or many diacritics appear above
                        and below the lines, Tesseract can erroneously conclude that there is no
                        white space and, hence, that there are no letters to be read in those
                        places. The test results align with this understanding of Tesseract’s
                        segmentation function. While the majority of lines were accurately
                        recognized as such by Tesseract in both Language and Script modes, Tesseract
                        nevertheless exhibited issues with segmentation in East Syriac, the type
                        style containing the most diacritical marks.</p>
                    <p xml:lang="en"> Tesseract segmented Serto with 100% accuracy in both Script
                        and Language modes. There were no truncated words or missed lines. Serto’s
                        remarkable segmentation accuracy likely arises from its wide white spaces
                        between lines, as well as from its extra-long lines of text. The Serto
                        images which were OCRed contained on average 47.6 characters per line, a
                        45–47% increase from the average line length in the East Syriac and
                        Estrangela images. And the tests conducted on manuscripts (discussed below)
                        gave evidence that the longer a line of text is, the better Tesseract is
                        able to recognize it.</p>
                    <p xml:lang="en"> Tesseract performed similarly well with Estrangela, truncating
                        only 11 characters total across all six pages of Script and Language modes.
                        Six of those characters were a <foreign xml:lang="syr">ܡܠܟ</foreign> cluster at the end of the first line of the page that dropped
                        off in both Language and Script.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn68" n="68"><p

                        Script. Given the 5,541 total characters in all six pages, this produces a
                        segmentation accuracy rate of 99.80%. This segmentation accuracy likely
                        results from the wide, white spaces between lines in the Estrangela images
                        tested. </p>
                    <p xml:lang="en"> With East Syriac, Tesseract truncated multiple words and
                        missed a full line in both Script and Language for a total of 162 dropped
                        characters. With a higher total number of characters on the page to begin
                        with, this still generated a 97.59% accuracy rate. Given that the East
                        Syriac text had far less white space between lines compared with the Serto
                        and Estrangela images as a result of its many diacritical marks, the
                        less-precise segmentation results for East Syriac are naturally explained.

                    <p xml:lang="en">Alongside character recognition and segmentation errors, the
                        testing detected errors in spacing between words. The OCR process often
                        added extra paragraph breaks between lines, mostly when there was truly a
                        paragraph break in the text. There were also additional spaces between
                        punctuation marks and words. As those issues do not inhibit the reading or
                        searchability of the text itself, this paper does not discuss them.</p>
                    <p xml:lang="en"> Some spacing issues, however, do impact the reading of the
                        text. Found in several documents, there were cases of added spaces in the
                        middle of words and deleted spaces between words.<note place="foot"
                            xml:id="ftn69" n="69"><p xml:lang="en"> Among these cases were
                                East Syriac-Language Page 3 (additions and deletions) and
                                Serto-Script Page 3 (deletion).</p></note> The chief example of this
                        comes from a line in the East Syriac text (Figure 12). A line with few
                        pixels between words, it was first recognized in Language mode as one word
                        with no spaces, even before and after the colon. The consonant and diacritic
                        errors found in this line were typical of those found throughout the East
                        Syriac results, but the extreme lack of spacing made this line unique. The
                        Script mode fared far better, correctly adding spaces between several of the
                        words, though it also combined the last few words into one. The number of
                        pixels between words cannot be the sole cause of the problem at hand; other
                        type styles exhibited spacing problems on a smaller scale. The wide spacing
                        between words in the Serto document did not prevent two words combining into
                        one for no discernible reason.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn70" n="70"><p
                                rend="footnote text"> Serto-Script Page 3.</p></note> The Estrangela
                        text, also with wide spacing, did not encounter this particular problem in
                        the pages studied. </p>
                    <p xml:lang="en"> It should be noted that the accuracy rates given in this paper
                        do not include spacing errors since the project’s analysis is based on
                        characters in the original image. The aim of the project was to determine
                        character recognition, and the analysts prioritized texts with wide spacing
                        in order to do so. When others perform OCR in the future, texts with
                        narrower spacing between words may encounter more instances like the one
                        given above, where multiple words are OCRed as one word. Texts with wide
                        spacing, like the majority of those tested here, may also find deleted or
                        added spaces scattered throughout with no obvious cause. While this did not
                        occur in every page tested in this project, even the small numbers of errors
                        on these few pages imply a high likelihood of spacing errors across large
                        texts.</p>
                    <p xml:lang="en"> Given this, as Tesseract stands, it seems inevitable that
                        spaces will be added or eliminated between some words during the OCR process
                        and thus interfere with the accuracy of the searchable text. This assumption
                        is based on the team’s observation that the current version of Tesseract
                        does not encode whether the letters in an image are initial, medial, or
                        final. Instead, it appears that the program maps the various allographic
                        forms of a grapheme into one Unicode value and thus does not transfer the
                        differentiation between letter forms to the resulting document. With the
                        tight spacing of this East Syriac line (Figure 12), the reader must be able
                        to recognize the final forms of the letters in order to determine where
                        words end in the initial image. The OCRed document in Language mode, for
                        example, does not receive the information that the first <hi rend="italic"
                            >nun </hi>in the line is a final <hi rend="italic">nun</hi>, resulting
                        in a much larger word. Fonts determine a letter’s form based on what follows
                        it, and thus the second <hi rend="italic">nun </hi>is turned into a final
                            <hi rend="italic">nun </hi>because of the colon. Based on this
                        observation, future training of Tesseract should work to encode the
                        allographic forms of the grapheme into separate Unicode values, one for each
                        initial, medial, and final. To aid with the spacing issue itself, spaces
                        could be required after every final letter.</p>

                <p xml:lang="en">Following the study of Tesseract’s performance on printed Syriac
                    texts, the analysts conducted additional tests on images of Syriac manuscripts.
                    The aim was to assess Tesseract’s potential as a tool for digitally transcribing
                    handwritten Syriac. Three pages of <hi rend="italic">Damascus </hi><hi
                        rend="italic">12/21</hi> from the Syriac Orthodox Patriarchate were chosen
                    for testing: 72r, 159r, and 163v. <hi rend="italic">Damascus 12/21 </hi>was
                    selected because its hand is the basis for the Meltho font Estrangela Antioch,
                    and thus it was hypothesized that Tesseract had a high chance of being able to
                    recognize this text accurately. Three particular pages were chosen for their
                    relatively straight and well-spaced lines.</p>
                <p xml:lang="en"> As in the study on printed texts, Tesseract was tested on all
                    three pages using both language command-line arguments: Syriac Language (-l Syr)
                    and Syriac Script (-l script/Syriac). Tesseract’s output was then compared to
                    the original image and all the consonantal errors were logged. In order to
                    provide a point of comparison, three additional pages of Estrangela text from
                    three different manuscripts were selected from <hi rend="italic">Hatch’s Album

                    <p xml:lang="en">Manuscripts initially proved more difficult for Tesseract to
                        recognize than the printed texts. When the images of the manuscripts were
                        run through Tesseract without any prior editing done to them, the OCR engine
                        produced too little text to analyze—and in some cases no text at all.
                        Therefore, several stages of edits were conducted on the images to make them
                        “easier” for Tesseract to read and to derive more fruitful output files that
                        could be analyzed in depth. The multiple edits were initially carried out on
                            <hi rend="italic">Damascus 12/21</hi> 72r until a result was achieved
                        that the analysts felt was suitably successful; then the other images were
                        edited following the same process. </p>
                    <p xml:lang="en"> The images of <hi rend="italic">Damascus 12/21</hi> supplied
                        for testing were high-quality color photographs that showed full pages of
                        the manuscript on a black background. The text was written in Estrangela in
                        two long and narrow columns per page, with approximately three words per
                        column line and twenty-five lines per page. At the first stage in the
                        editing process, the photograph of 72r was cropped of all empty space such
                        as the background and page margins and then color-edited to black and white.
                        Two images were created from the photograph, each containing one column of
                        text. These two images were run through Tesseract, and both modes were
                        tested. Despite the editing, Tesseract did not recognize any text in column
                        1 using either mode, and it recognized only 14 fragmentary lines in column
                        2. The specific 14 lines differed between Language and Script modes, but
                        both produced 14 OCRed lines.</p>

                    <p xml:lang="en">At the next stage of editing, line spacing was exaggerated so
                        that no letters overlapped onto other lines. These images were tested again
                        in both modes. A modest improvement was made on the recognition of column 1,
                        with 11 characters now recognized by Tesseract, but the results were still
                        poor compared with the earlier tests on printed texts. Finally, the images
                        were re-edited using a photo editor to combine both columns into a single
                        image, elongating the lines so they fit approximately ten words per line
                        rather than three. At this stage, more than half of the text was recognized
                        by Tesseract and these improvements occurred in both modes.</p>
                    <p xml:lang="en"> Now that 72r had been successfully edited to produce similar
                        accuracy rates to the printed texts, the remaining manuscript images were

                        output files were compared to the original images and the errors were
                        recorded. The results that follow are from tests conducted on the final
                        forms of the edited manuscript images.</p>

                    <p xml:lang="en">When comparing Tesseract’s output files to the original images,
                        analysts recorded only consonantal errors in this preliminary test to
                        provide a general idea of how well Tesseract might perform on manuscripts.
                        The consonantal error categories were also simplified so that the errors
                        encountered were recorded in one of four general categories—deleted,
                        substituted, added, and truncated—which encapsulated all the varieties of
                        consonantal errors that occurred. Consonants were considered “deleted” when
                        the consonant in the original image was missing in the output from a word
                        that had otherwise been recognized by Tesseract; consonants were considered
                        “substituted” when a consonant in the original image was mistaken for a
                        different consonant; consonants were considered “added” when a consonant
                        appeared in the output where no corresponding consonant appeared in the
                        original; and consonants were considered “truncated” when they were missing
                        from the output due to partial or full lines of text being missed by
                        Tesseract. Using this data, the analysts calculated accuracy rates for each
                        set of pages in both modes.</p>

                        <p xml:lang="en"> The three pages tested from <hi rend="italic">Damascus
                                12/21</hi> contained a total of 1,924 consonants. There were 553
                            consonantal errors in Language mode and 630 consonantal errors in Script
                            mode. With all these errors taken into account, the consonantal accuracy
                            rate for the Language mode is 72.30% and the consonantal accuracy rate
                            for Script is 67.26%. These results are significantly lower than the
                            consonantal accuracy rate for the printed Estrangela texts that were
                            tested, which were recognized with over 98% accuracy in both modes.</p>
                        <p xml:lang="en"> Tesseract generated significantly more errors of each type
                            for <hi rend="italic">Damascus 12/21</hi> than for the printed texts,
                            but the low accuracy was primarily the result of the high number of
                            consonants deleted due to line truncation. As Table 26 shows, truncated
                            characters were by far the most frequent error, accounting for over half
                            of the errors in both modes. As this error is possibly caused by issues
                            with the input image, an accuracy rate was also calculated which
                            excluded truncated characters from both the total consonant and the
                            total error counts. When truncated characters are removed from the
                            calculation, the accuracy rate raises significantly to 83.34% in
                            Language and 83.32% in Script.</p>
                        <p xml:lang="en"> Plates 29, 34, and 35 contained a total of 1,770
                            consonants. 240 errors were recorded in Language and 160 recorded in
                            Script. With all these errors taken into account, Tesseract was able to
                            correctly recognize 86.44% of consonants in Language mode and 90.96% of
                            consonants in Script mode. These accuracy rates are still lower than
                            those for the printed pages, but they are much higher than the accuracy
                            ratings for <hi rend="italic">Damascus 12/21</hi>. This increase in
                            accuracy is attributable in part to the far-lower number of truncated
                            characters, but the number of errors recorded for the other three
                            categories decreased as well. When truncated characters are removed from
                            the calculation, the consonantal accuracy rate raises slightly to 89.37%
                            for Language and 91.74% for Script.</p>

                    <p xml:lang="en">These results indicate that Tesseract is able to recognize
                        handwritten Estrangela with a reasonably high accuracy rate but only when
                        the images have been heavily edited so that the manuscripts more closely
                        resemble pages of printed texts. Even after a long editing process,
                        Tesseract often truncates words or whole or partial lines, significantly
                        reducing its OCR accuracy. These obstacles mean that, at present, Tesseract
                        is probably not useful to scholars seeking a quick method for digitally
                        transcribing manuscripts. If in the future Tesseract can be trained to
                        recognize text in narrow columns, and if a method of minimizing line
                        truncation is found, Tesseract could become a useful and accurate tool for
                        the optical character recognition of manuscripts.<note place="foot"

                <head>7.TIPS FOR USAGE</head>
                <p xml:lang="en">This paper has outlined and analyzed a great amount of data from
                    this project but has yet to spell out how this information may best help those
                    who desire to use Tesseract for their scholarship. Here is a brief list of such
                    practical tips:</p>
                <list type="unordered">
                    <item>For all OCR usage, it is recommended to first crop all scanned images to
                        eliminate all marginalia and footnotes. If there are footnotes, the
                        superscripted footnote references within the body of the text are likely to
                        appear as punctuation marks or numerals within the text (See Non-Syriac
                        characters).</item>
                    <item>Users should also be aware that any headings, especially those in a
                        different script or language, should be specifically checked. This project
                        did not study changes in language or styles, but it is likely that headings
                        could cause some issues in the output. </item>
                    <item>The sections on Usual One-Off Errors, Segmentation, and Spacing can help
                        users conceptualize what may occur with their own texts. For each image
                        OCRed, the output file always inserted the line breaks as they appeared in
                        the original image, leaving blank space on the left-hand side of the
                        document. If the text is prose, users may want to go through the lines and
                        eliminate the spaces. However, this should be done after the text has been
                        checked, if line-by-line accuracy is desired. </item>
                    <item>Ideally, the desired text would be printed in an Estrangela type style
                        with a minimal amount of diacritics and OCRed with using Language mode.
                        These tests have established that OCRing the same page in both Language and
                        Script modes, either simultaneously or one after another, will not
                        substantially improve accuracy results. OCRing an already-OCRed page will
                        only magnify the number of errors since the second OCR run will create
                        errors upon the first run’s errors. Nor is it worthwhile to OCR the same
                        page in both modes and then attempt to map the two onto one another to
                        identify separate errors. Almost without exception, all of the consonantal
                        errors present in Language mode were also created in Script mode.<note

                        additional errors beyond those of the Language mode. Thus, users can
                        responsibly focus their OCR projects on Language mode alone. </item>
                    <item>If looking to produce a near-perfect document, even Estrangela texts OCRed
                        in Language mode should be checked thoroughly. <ref

                        with consonants. </item>
                    <item>The paper has focused on consonantal accuracy, but for practical use, the
                        notes and data on diacritics should be consulted. For example, Estrangela
                        texts OCRed in Language mode had a significant amount of errors with
                        homograph dots and <hi rend="italic">syomés</hi> (see <ref
                            target="#4.2.2_Diacritics">Estrangela Diacritics</ref>). Texts with
                        minimal diacritics will have higher likelihood of success.</item>

                        and verify whether the letters within the word are likely to be OCRed
                            correctly.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn76" n="76"><p

                                text. Word truncation occurred even in the most accurate results and
                                could cause problems in the text, beyond the letter accuracy data
                                given in the tables below. </item>
                            <item>On the other hand, if a more generalized understanding of a word's
                                meaning and usage within a text is desired and the user does not
                                require an analysis of the word's every occurrence, a full check on
                                the OCRed results would not be necessary. </item>
                            <item>For example, if users desire to study a word such as ܦܢܩ in a

                                confirm the expected accuracy rates of each letter. They would learn
                                that, in Estrangela, each of the three letters is highly likely to
                                be OCRed correctly. Thus, when they utilize an appropriate find
                                function in their word processor, most instances of ܦܢܩ should be
                                easily identified. </item>
                            <item>If the word in an Estrangela text includes ܣ, it may be easier to
                                search for the letters surrounding it in the word because, as <ref
                                    target="#Individual_Letter_Accuracy">Tables 39–41</ref> note, ܣ
                                has the lowest accuracy rate of all consonants in that type style.
                                Though generally inadvisable to OCR Serto or East Syriac texts, the
                                same tables indicate that ܣ is one of the most accurate letters
                                within those scripts. Words with a combination of more accurate
                                consonants in Syriac or East Syriac can be studied through a search
                                for that combination. If users want to investigate the word <foreign xml:lang="syr">ܡܪܐ</foreign> in a

                                likely, their search should include both <foreign xml:lang="syr">ܡܪܐ</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="syr">ܡܕܐ</foreign> to assure that
                                they do not miss a possible switch between the two letters.</item>

                <head>>8. CONCLUSION</head>
                <p xml:lang="en">Several things may be concluded from the foregoing tests. First,
                    this testing process confirmed Tesseract’s reliability for OCRing printed
                    Estrangela texts. When consonants are the reader’s only concern, Tesseract 4.0
                    will perform at close to 99% accuracy using either mode. Since most printed
                    Syriac texts use Estrangela, this is encouraging news for Syriac studies.<note
                        place="foot" xml:id="ftn77" n="77"><p xml:lang="en"> Estrangela’s
                            consonantal accuracy cannot likely be improved. According to the
                            Tesseract programming community on GitHub, “unless you're using a very
                            unusual font or a new language retraining Tesseract is unlikely to
                            help.” [ImproveQuality, GitHub, last updated April 21, 2018, <ref

                            for scholars, Tesseract already generates useable OCR results for
                            Estrangela. </p></note> An electronic database of Syriac texts has been
                    in development since the early 2000s, but the project has been hampered by the
                    slow pace of manual transcription.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn78" n="78"><p
                            rend="footnote text"> Digital Syriac Corpus, at <ref
                                target="http://syriaccorpus.org/">syriaccorpus.org</ref>, accessed
                            30 July, 2018.</p></note> Using Tesseract to OCR these printed Syriac
                    texts would dramatically speed up the process. Such OCRing should begin with
                    Estrangela type styles. Of course, these accuracy rates are based on cropped
                    scans in which marginalia and footnotes have been removed, so some background
                    work will be necessary for OCRing. But given the time that is saved through
                    digital OCR, the minor manual editing seems worthwhile for Estrangela texts. </p>
                <p xml:lang="en"> Second, Tesseract 4.0 is not currently recommended for OCRing
                    Serto and East Syriac. These type styles are less accurate and hover around 90%
                    consonantal accuracy (88.11–93.4% range) in both modes. Tesseract may be useful
                    for an initial computer-generated pass-through in these type styles, but for
                    full readability and searchability of texts humans will need to review and edit
                    the OCRed text themselves. While accuracy rates can be improved for these type
                    styles, until a training method for Tesseract is developed that does not require
                    inputting hundreds of thousands of lines of text it is unlikely that time spent
                    retraining Tesseract’s model will be time-effective. That being said, since
                    fewer texts have been printed in East Syriac and Serto, manually transcribing
                    these texts many prove a feasible alternative for gaining the digital texts. </p>
                <p xml:lang="en"> Third, Tesseract’s OCR accuracy with Serto can likely be improved
                    by training Tesseract on a Serto font that is based on W64 print type. As the
                    analysts discovered during the testing project, Tesseract was most assuredly
                    trained on Meltho fonts, and thus, print types closely related to Meltho fonts
                    will perform better with Tesseract. Print types S14 and E22, those tested here
                    for Estrangela and East Syriac, happened to be part of the set of types used as
                    the basis for Meltho fonts, while W64, that tested for Serto, was not. Much of
                    Tesseract’s unique error results for Serto are likely attributable to this
                    discrepancy between print type and training font. If a programmer were to train
                    Tesseract with a font based on W64, Tesseract’s OCR accuracy with W64 print type
                    would likely improve significantly. </p>
                <p xml:lang="en"> Fourth, these tests have verified that Tesseract has the potential
                    to recognize handwritten Estrangela texts with a good accuracy, but at present
                    demands a laborious and time-consuming editing process to make the images
                    readable. Even after this extensive editing process the accuracy rate varies
                    between 67%–90%, and so it is not recommended that scholars attempt to OCR
                    manuscripts using Tesseract at this time. Tesseract would need many programming
                    developments before it could become a practical, usable tool for OCRing Syriac
                    manuscripts.</p>
                <p xml:lang="en"> In practical advice, while variances remain when discussing
                    individual letters, running Tesseract with the Language mode command-line
                    argument (i.e., “-l Syr”) generates slightly more accurate results in all three
                    type styles and is the recommended mode to use. In addition, the time spent
                    cropping and deskewing scanned images before OCRing is well worth the
                    investment. Without these steps, and without color-adjusting to black and white,
                    Tesseract’s accuracy rates would drop significantly.</p>
                <p xml:lang="en"> With a little practice, Tesseract can offer Syriac scholars a
                    straightforward way of digitally transcribing printed Estrangela texts. If
                    embraced by Syriac scholars, it has the potential to advance the field by
                    improving the availability of printed Estrangela texts and opportunities to
                    access them. As developments are made in OCR it is hoped that soon Serto and
                    East Syriac will be recognized accurately enough to join Estrangela in this
                    regard. The goal to OCR a high number and wide variety of printed Estrangela
                    texts is sure to keep Syriac scholars busy in the meantime.</p>

                                rend="footnote text"> Tesseract occasionally inserted or swapped in
                                three Arabic characters (the <hi rend="italic">fatḥah</hi>, <hi
                                    rend="italic">shadda</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">sukun</hi>) for
                                Syriac characters. Why Tesseract pulled Arabic characters into the
                                data set, let alone these particular characters and not others, is
                                not fully clear at this point and is difficult to determine due to
                                the inconsistency with which these errors occurred. At first
                                analysis it would seem that Tesseract preferences Syriac characters
                                over Arabic characters when OCRing in Syriac modes—typically
                                identifying a printed mark as a Syriac character if there is a
                                similar-looking one in the Unicode set and only secondarily
                                inserting Arabic characters if a Syriac one cannot be found.
                                However, this trend does not play out consistently. For instance,
                                whilst the Arabic <hi rend="italic">fatḥah</hi> (U+064E) sometimes
                                appeared in place of the Syriac oblique line (U+0747), the Syriac
                                    <hi rend="italic">zqapha</hi> (U+0733) was never misidentified
                                for the similarly shaped Arabic <hi rend="italic">ḍ</hi><hi
                                    rend="italic">ammah</hi> (U+064F). One possible explanation is
                                that that when Tesseract was trained, certain Arabic diacritics were
                                incorrectly incorporated into the Syriac data set—muddying the
                                waters, so to speak. Without further information about the Tesseract
                                training process, the analysts cannot ascertain all of the engine’s
                                resultant OCR peculiarities.</p></note></head>

                                    necessarily represent actual accuracy rates but rather give a
                                    clearer understanding of the results through statistical
                                    analysis (specifically the mean and standard deviation). The
                                    counts are the number of consonants that have accuracy rates
                                    that are equal to or higher than the statistical value.

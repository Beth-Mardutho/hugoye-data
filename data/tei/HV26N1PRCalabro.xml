                U.K.: The Jericho Press, 2018). Pp. vii + 212; £60 or $80.</head>

            <p xml:lang="en">Coakley’s beautifully printed catalogue of Syriac manuscripts
                that were added to the collections of the Cambridge University Library since 1901 is
                a complement to the two-volume work of William Wright and Stanley A. Cook, <hi
                    rend="italic">A Catalogue of the Syriac Manuscripts Preserved in the Library of
                    the University of Cambridge</hi> (1901). Coakley’s work lives up to the fine
                descriptive cataloguing standards of its predecessor and also incorporates some new
                features. It includes a total of 112 manuscripts or groups of fragments, including
                13 of Western origin.</p>
            <p xml:lang="en">After the table of contents, preface, and introduction, Coakley
                includes a “Conspectus of the manuscripts” (pp. 5–8) giving the library number or
                “classmark,” basic contents, date, and classification (East or West Syriac) of each
                manuscript, similar to the “Index of Manuscripts” at the end of the catalogue of
                Wright and Cook. The “Works cited and abbreviations” following the conspectus (pp.
                9–12) is indicative of this catalogue’s function as a guide to previous work on
                these manuscripts. The body of the catalogue spans 187 pages (pp. 13–199). Finally,
                Coakley includes five indexes (pp. 201–12): “Authors and texts,” “Scribes,” “Other
                personal names,” “Places and monasteries,” and “Other manuscripts cited.”</p>
            <p xml:lang="en">The manuscripts in the catalogue include Bibles, liturgical books,
                theological works, <hi rend="italic">memre</hi>, grammars, lexicons, hagiographies,
                and apocryphal literature. Along with manuscripts that are Syriac in both script and
                language, there are some texts in Arabic Garshuni, Malayalam Garshuni, and
                Neo-Aramaic. However, as Coakley explains on p. vi, the catalogue excludes
                manuscripts in Christian Palestinian Aramaic. Of particular note among the
                manuscripts in the catalogue are a polyglot (Hebrew, Greek, Syriac, and Arabic)
                Psalter studied by Sebastian Brock and assigned by him to a fourteenth-century
                Egyptian provenance (Or. 929, pp. 27–29); a Syriac amulet originating from Iran and
                dating to the sixth or seventh century (Or. 2480, pp. 156–58); and several Syriac
                texts from the Cairo Genizah, mostly undertexts of palimpsests (pp. 159–61).</p>
            <p xml:lang="en">In the tradition of the catalogue of Wright and Cook and of Wright’s
                three-volume <hi rend="italic">Catalogue of Syriac Manuscripts in the British
                    Museum</hi> (London, 1870), Coakley’s catalogue is richly descriptive in style.
                Each entry includes not only basic data and an identification of the main texts on
                the manuscript, but also an elaborate analysis of the contents, as well as comments
                on the script, ownership notes, marginalia, and acquisition of the manuscript where
                applicable. As a typical example, the description of Or. 1142, a manuscript of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Ethicon</hi> of Bar Hebraeus, opens (p. 60) with a small-print
                paragraph that includes (1) basic codicological data (support, dimensions,
                foliation, quires, date, and binding); (2) script and layout, including a judgment
                on the script (“Written in a regular Serto hand”); (3) date; and (4) detailed
                description of the binding and its condition. Next, the title and author of the main
                text of the manuscript are given in Roman script, with a footnote referencing
                Takahashi’s treatment of this title and this manuscript. Then follows a detailed
                breakdown of the contents of the manuscript, including both the main text and the
                paratexts added by the scribe. For the main text, Coakley gives the English and the
                Syriac of the rubrics, even listing the individual <hi rend="italic">memre</hi> of
                the <hi rend="italic">Ethicon</hi> with the number of chapters in each and where
                they are located on this manuscript. For the colophon, he transcribes the Syriac of
                the main part, followed by an English sentence giving the names of the scribe and
                his mother by way of summary. Coakley then transcribes a prayer from fol. 324b,
                added by one “Karas, bishop of Mar Behnam,” in the cryptic “alphabet of Bardaisan”
                (Coakley gives the original cryptic characters with Syriac transliteration
                underneath). The entry concludes with a report of Teule’s treatment of this
                manuscript in the latter’s edition of the first part of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ethicon</hi>. The high level of description makes this catalogue more than just
                a means of accessing the manuscripts. Rather, the book is a study in its own right.
                This is particularly true for the descriptions of liturgical texts, in which Coakley
                lists the text for each feast day (see, for example, the description of Or. 1296, an
                East Syriac collection of hymns, on pp. 100–108). Especially helpful is the synoptic
                table showing the “Contents of East Syriac Gospel lectionary manuscripts in this
                catalogue” (pp. 89–93).</p>
            <p xml:lang="en">The catalogue is notable for its fine typography, a hallmark of
                Coakley’s Jericho Press. Following in the tradition of the catalogue by Wright and
                Cook, the Syriac fonts (Estrangela, Serto, and East Syriac) are appropriate to the
                manuscript being catalogued. One striking feature that goes beyond the previous
                catalogue is the use of red font to indicate rubrication in the manuscripts. This
                adds variety to the printed page, although some readers might find it distracting.
                The catalogue of Wright and Cook, by contrast, uses overlining to indicate
                rubrication. In any case, it is helpful to have the rubrics marked, especially in
                large blocks of Syriac text. </p>
            <p xml:lang="en">Another feature that goes beyond the catalogue of Wright and Cook is
                the inclusion of fifteen high-quality color photographs (pp. 14, 16, 22, 24, 28, 37,
                53, 63, 74, 151, 157, 163, 164, 166, 169). As Coakley explains on pp. vi–vii, some
                of these photographs show scripts that are interesting paleographically, while some
                are included “on account of peculiarities or special beauty, or with an eye to the
                possibilities of identifying a scribe.”</p>
            <p xml:lang="en">A general issue raised by this catalogue is that of standardization
                in names and in the titles of works. On p. vii in the preface, Coakley explains his
                    <hi rend="italic">modus operandi</hi> in the spelling of names:</p>
            <p rend="GP Normal Quote">Personal and geographical names in this catalogue are treated
                inconsistently. ‘John’ is the name of the Apostle; but forms like Yuḥanan, Yoḥanan,
                Yawnan, etc. are retained for others. Names ending in <hi rend="italic">-iel</hi>
                are not straightforward to transliterate from Syriac and I have almost always kept
                their usual English forms. Other conventional names are also kept: Ephrem,
                Barhebraeus, Khamis, etc., and place-names Mosul, Marbhishuʿ, Telkef, etc. Other
                Syriac names and words are transliterated according to a simplified system without
                macrons or doubling. East Syriac forms are used except for West Syriac liturgical
                terms (<hi rend="italic">Fenqitho</hi>, <hi rend="italic">lilyo</hi>, etc.). I hope
                this system will be comfortable for the majority of users.</p>
            <p xml:lang="en">The transliteration of Syriac names in Roman script has long
                been a complex issue; many modern systems compete with each other and with Latinized
                spellings that have been in conventional usage in the West since the early modern
                era. In this digital age, when print works are quickly becoming converted to
                computer-searchable formats, it becomes increasingly important for print as well as
                digital works to reflect a concern for standardization. This applies equally to
                titles of works, for example <hi rend="italic">Ethicon</hi> vs. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Itiḳon</hi> (the latter is the spelling used by the Library of Congress
                Authority File). As Coakley states, at the time of writing of the preface it was
                expected that “in due course most readers will be consulting [the catalogue] on
                line.” Thus, this catalogue is a reminder of a broad need to be more intentional
                about standardization for the sake of a machine “readership,” in order to ensure
                future access.</p>
            <p xml:lang="en">The level of scholarship evident in Coakley’s catalogue is of the
                highest caliber, matching the importance of the manuscripts catalogued therein.
                There is no doubt that this book will continue to be a crucial reference work in
                companionship with the catalogue of Wright and Cook.</p>

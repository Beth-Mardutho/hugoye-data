               <head>Abstract</head>
               <p xml:lang="en">Rhetoric was part of the borrowed Greek
                   educational system of the <hi rend="italic">Enkyklios paideia,</hi> together with
                   logic and grammar. However, the technical terminology had to be adapted, so the
                   question is which strategies were used to create the vocabulary of Syriac rhetoric.
                   This paper aims at analyzing some meaningful loanwords, adaptations, calques and
                   native words used to build this specialized lexis. A manuscript containing the
                   Syriac version of Aristotle’s <hi rend="italic">Rhetoric</hi> was never found, and
                   we need to rely upon other texts that dealt with this topic: Antony of Taġrit’s <hi
                       rend="italic">Books of Rhetoric</hi>, a part of Bar Šakko’s <hi rend="italic"
                           >Book of dialogues</hi> and a part of Bar Hebraeus’s <hi rend="italic">Cream of
                               wisdom</hi>. If we wish to have a deeper appreciation of this vocabulary,
                   however, we need to take into account the Arabic version of Aristotle’s <hi
                       rend="italic">Rhetoric</hi>, since it displays some interesting peculiarities
                   that can help us in the reconstructive process of what the Syriac version might have
                   looked like. A very useful tool would be the compilation of a database comparing the
                   Syriac lexis found in the abovementioned texts with the ones used in the Greek and
                   Arabic versions of Aristotle’s book: actually, this method already highlighted some
                   surprising phenomena that will be presented in this paper, in order to show how
                   trilingual comparison can be an important tool to shed some light on the translation
                   movement of both texts and cultural patterns that started in Late Antiquity.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn0" n="*"

            <p xml:lang="en">The path that brought Aristotelian rhetoric towards the Arabic milieu is a long and
                complicated one, though it has occasionally been conceived as straightforward, from
                Greek to Arabic, diminishing the role played by the Syriac world. To weaken the
                position of Syriac in this field there is the fact that no manuscript containing the
                Syriac version of Aristotle’s <hi rend="italic">Techne Rhetorike</hi> has been found
                so far. At the present time, then, the first work dealing with rhetoric in Syriac
                belongs to, apparently, the 9<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> century and this absence
                of relevant works on the topic composed during the so-called ‘classical period’
                unfortunately led some scholars to the wrong impression that the Syriac world was
                somehow unaware of Aristotelian rhetoric until late, and that a translation of this
                work was never produced. </p>
            <p xml:lang="en"> This paper aims at showing that, despite the late date of the Syriac works, they can
                probably be considered the products of a tradition of interpretation of Aristotle’s
                books and also the result of a lively discussion on the topic. This interest in
                Aristotelian sciences, and specifically <hi rend="italic">Rhetoric</hi>, is
                testified, for instance, by the letter written by Patriarch Timothy I to Mar
                Pethion, in which he asks his delegate to find out whether the monastery of Mar
                Mattai possesses commentaries or scholia in Syriac (or other languages) on <hi

                <head>Syriac Works on Rhetoric</head>
                <p xml:lang="en">Concerning the Syriac contributions to rhetorical studies, the most important –
                    and yet still little known – one is the work of Antony of Taġrit: the author
                    composed what looks like a handbook designed for students of rhetoric, divided
                    into five volumes, that explains in details various aspects of the ‘art of
                        speaking’.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn2" n="2"><p rend="footnote text">
                            J.W. Watt, “Guarding the Syriac language in an Arabic environment:
                            Antony of Tagrit on the use of grammar in rhetoric”, in <hi

                            Bekkum, et al. (Leuven: Peeters, 2007), 136. Moreover, as J.W. Watt,
                            “Rhetorical education and Florilegia in Syriac”, in <hi rend="italic"

                            M. Farina (Paris: Geuthner 2018), 96, ft. 2, recently remarked, it would
                            be more appropriate to say that Antony composed two treatises on
                            rhetoric, a longer one in four books called ‘On the science of
                            Rhetoric’, and a shorter one, that coincides with what is normally
                            accounted as <hi rend="italic">The fifth book of Rhetoric</hi>, called
                            ‘On the ornamentation and decoration of words’. Regardless, since the
                            five books division is widespread and accepted, this paper, as Watt’s,
                            will use the conventional reference for the sake of commodity.
                        </p></note> The books are based on Aristotelian material but also display
                    some important differences that show influences of other Greek philosophers like
                        Plato.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn3" n="3"><p rend="footnote text"> On the

                    Antony’s efforts also served as a starting point for portions of at least two

                        with considerable freedom. Since in philosophy Syriac has preserved versions
                        of late antique compilations of which the originals have been lost, it is by
                        no means impossible that behind Antony’s treatise lies some lost Greek

                        rhetorical teaching which had developed in its own particular way.<note

                    determining the period he lived in, specifically with regard to his prose and
                    the language he uses. The impression one gets is that of a quite late Syriac,
                    clearly not in its early classical stage: the texts display, for instance,
                    plenty of finite verbs instead of the abundance of participles characterizing
                    Late Aramaic style.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn23" n="23"><p

                    (alternated sometimes with the plural) is another interesting feature, probably
                    to be explained in the light of the ultimate aim of his work, which was intended
                    as a hard copy for students. This idea is also supported by the richness of
                    examples that the author provides, which would not have been necessary if we
                    were to exclude a didactic aim: this abundance ultimately makes the work not
                    easy to read. In the light of all this, Antony’s prose often appears heavy and
                    repetitive, but testifies to a certain knowledge of the works of his
                    forerunners, that are frequently quoted.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn24" n="24"

                    while, whenever the two were not sufficient to him, he turned to a Syriac copy,

                                Rhetoric</hi>, 51-61, expresses some doubts about the existence of a
                            Syriac version, saying only that ‘it is not unlikely that the <hi
                                rend="italic">Rhetoric</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Poetics</hi> were
                            at some point translated into Syriac’ (p. 57). Admittedly though, later
                            he says that ‘So far, all we can say with some assurance is that Syriac
                            authors were probably acquainted with the text but that does not require
                            the existence of written or textual knowledge. As it is, the only
                            reliable witness for the existence of a Syriac translation – which we
                            are not in a position to date – is the Arabic <hi rend="italic"
                                >Rhetoric</hi> itself. There are two types of evidence that have
                            been derived from the Arabic translation: Ibn al-Samḥ’s marginal notes
                            referring to a Syriac version; and terminological features of the
                            translation that point to a Syriac source text’ (p. 59). Vagelpohl then
                            criticizes M.C. Lyons, <hi rend="italic">Aristotle’s Ars Rhetorica</hi>,
                            II-VIII and XXV-XXVI, and E. Panoussi, “The unique Arabic manuscript”,
                            for taking the existence of the Syriac version for granted, and
                            concludes that the evidences provided by them are far from being
                            conclusive (pp. 60-61). </p></note> The extant Arabic version was also
                    the one used by Hermannus Alemannus to compose his Latin version of the text, a

                    throughout the Syriac and Arabic environments, a comparative trilingual
                    approach, including also Greek terminology, proves to be a good starting point.
                    Actually, rhetoric has not been investigated extensively as other sciences have
                    been, probably also due to the fact that, normally, it does not fit into those
                    categories such as, for instance, philosophy (at least in its modern concept),
                    that have received greater attention by scholars. Admittedly, in a recent paper

                    what kind of texts he was looking at while composing his treatises. Since he
                    was, most likely, a teacher of rhetoric, he should have been at least acquainted
                    with Greek tradition, but considering his (apparently unaware) use of Greek
                    technical terms, he does not appear too familiar with rhetorical works composed
                    in this language. He might also have used a Syriac version of Aristotle’s work
                    rather than its Greek original, as already stated, a conclusion that might be
                    supported by the confusion he makes between certain concepts, which he uses as
                    interchangeable and that would not have been misinterpreted if his source had
                    been a Greek one. An interesting example is provided by the words

                    ‘demonstration’, even though they correspond to two different Greek technical
                    terms: the first one is a loanword from <foreign xml:lang="gr"
                        >ἀπόδειξις</foreign>, while the second one corresponds to Greek <foreign

                            meaning ‘paradigm’. However, this loanword is absent from Antony’s fifth

                    according to Butts, the pronunciation of <foreign xml:lang="gr">ῥ</foreign>
                    changed in the meantime. This <foreign xml:lang="gr">ῥ</foreign> phenomenon is
                    represented in the orthography of the word for ‘rhetoric’ itself, as Antony’s
                    text preserves both <foreign xml:lang="syr">ܪܗܛܪܘܬܐ</foreign> and <foreign
                        xml:lang="syr">ܪܝܛܘܪܝܩܝ</foreign>. According to the spelling of the
                    reflection of the initial <foreign xml:lang="gr">ῥ</foreign>, the former example
                    is the more ancient form, which entered Syriac before the 5<hi

                    reflecting the shift in the realization of initial <foreign xml:lang="gr"
                        >ῥ</foreign>. Under the morphological point of view, the two borrowing
                    strategies appear very different: <foreign xml:lang="syr">ܪܗܛܪܘܬܐ</foreign>, the

                                failed to recognize this adaptation strategy, saying instead that

                    presence of both loanwords in Antony’s text and the interchangeable way in which
                    they are used mean that they were not perceived as having different

                <p xml:lang="en"> Later in time, the situation changes even more, as represented in Bar Hebraeus’s

                    the origin of loanwords was not meaningful anymore and the reasons for writing ܗ

                        >ريطوريقا</foreign>. Hence, the first one, <foreign xml:lang="ar"
                        >ريطوريّة</foreign>, appears to bear the same borrowing strategy of <foreign

                    to the recipient language, while <foreign xml:lang="ar">ريطوريقا</foreign> looks
                    very much like Syriac <foreign xml:lang="syr">ܪܝܛܘܪܝܩܝ</foreign>, preserving the final &lt;q&gt;. Since the two
                    loanwords show borrowing patterns resembling the ones found in Syriac, and since
                    they are not used anywhere else in the Arabic tradition, they are likely to have
                    reached the Arabic version of the Parisian manuscript by means of a Syriac text
                    rather than directly from Greek. Moreover, none of these loanwords is used in

                                >ῥ</foreign> in various positions inside the word due to the
                            ‘scantiness of the material’ (later he adds that it is likely that the

                    the title of abbot after Maqari’s death, knew both Syriac and Coptic, since he
                    added a second inscription in this latter language to his father’s epitaph, and
                    appears able to translate from one language into another. What we have here is

                    it evolved throughout the ages, until, probably, the 8<hi rend="superscript"
                        >th</hi>-10<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> century. This latter stage is
                    testified, at least for the Taġritan milieu, by Antony of Taġrit and his other
                    two fellow citizens, whereas, later, the spelling of ‘parrhesia’ suffers from a
                    general state of confusion, as testified by Bar Šakko and Bar Hebraeus, who,
                    actually, belong to the same period but opt for different orthographies of the
                    same word. </p>
                <p xml:lang="en"> As partly shown so far, Antony’s text shows plenty of Greek loanwords, normally
                    accommodated and arranged in various ways, but, as already remarked, sometimes
                    the same concept conveyed by a loanword can be found in its Syriac translation
                    and used side by side with the other one, in apparent free variation.
                    Occasionally, Antony uses the Greek loanword first, followed by its Syriac
                    translation a little later, in what can be interpreted as a ‘reader-oriented’
                    composing strategy. A good example of this tendency is provided by the word for
                    ‘syllable’ within the part of the treatise devoted to metrical patterns. Antony
                    provides a long excursus on metrical units in Syriac poetry, with examples and
                    explanations of the various meters based on syllabic patterns and on the way in
                    which they can be combined and exchanged. All along this treatise, then, he uses
                    the word for ‘syllable’, <foreign xml:lang="syr">ܗܓܝܢܐ</foreign>, combined with a number to express the names of
                    each type of verse (such as disyllable, trisyllable and so on). Every now and
                    then, though, he uses also a Greek loanword <foreign xml:lang="syr">ܣܘܠܒܣ</foreign>/ <foreign xml:lang="syr">ܣܘܠܒܐ</foreign><note place="foot"

                                S.P. Brock, “Greek words”, 254, states that a possible explanation

                                    <foreign xml:lang="syr">ܐܣܛܘܟܣܐ</foreign> would be the analogy
                                with the Syriac result of Greek words ending in <hi
                                rend="italic">-os</hi>. However, even though the Greek technical
                                term is indeed <foreign xml:lang="gr">στοιχεῖον</foreign>,
                                the Syriac and consequently Arabic loanwords may not descend from
                                it, since there would be little means of explaining, apart from
                                Brock’s idea of analogy, the fall of the Greek final <hi
                                rend="italic">-n</hi>. Alternatively, one might posit a case of
                                semantic contamination with the words <foreign xml:lang="gr"
                                >στίχος</foreign> or <foreign xml:lang="gr"
                                >στοῖχος</foreign>, which would offer an explanation for the
                                consonantal pattern. It looks like a merging of terms, which have
                                different meanings in Greek, into a single one in Syriac, which has
                                the meaning of the first one, <foreign xml:lang="gr"
                                >στοιχεῖον</foreign>, but the aspect of the second one,
                                <foreign xml:lang="gr">στίχος</foreign> or <foreign
                                xml:lang="gr">στοῖχος</foreign>. Moreover, in this scenario, the
                            realization in Syriac of the final <hi rend="italic">-s</hi> would
                                be in harmony with other cases given by Brock. It should be also
                                noted that Brock (ibid., 257) states that the form <foreign xml:lang="syr">ܐܣܛܘܟܣܐ</foreign> is the
                                older one, while in texts from the 6<hi rend="superscript"
                                >th</hi> century onwards the word is rather spelled as <hi

                                of Taġrit would be the more archaic one. On the use of a prosthetic

                    how to make words alliterate the most. According to him, the more letters words

                    starting from the keeping of the <foreign xml:lang="syr">ܦܪܨܘܦܐ</foreign> at the end of each verse-ending word.
                    ܦܪܨܘܦܐ has been translated here as ‘personal suffixes’, but should rather be
                    translated as ‘person’, as in the first meaning given by Moberg,<note

                <p xml:lang="en">Hopefully it has emerged from this analysis that the comparative study of Greek,
                    Syriac and Arabic rhetoric is productive and stimulating, apt to change some of
                    the previously fixed perspectives on the topic, which saw the Syriac world as
                    relatively uninterested in rhetoric and, consequently, Arabic rhetoric as
                    detached from any Syriac influence. The data presented here are just an
                    introduction to the potential that a trilingual comparative analysis has in
                    helping the scholarly community in the rhetorical field: the connections and
                    interdependences that have been proposed in the present paper hope to show how
                    much the aforementioned older perspectives need to be revised. Moreover, it
                    should be stressed that the Arabic version preserving Aristotle’s translation is
                    an incredibly rich source of vocabulary, since it stands quite different from
                    the one known in other treatises on Arabic rhetoric. It should be borne in mind
                    that rhetoric is a science which has an autonomous tradition in the Arab
                    culture: when referring to the Aristotelian science, <foreign xml:lang="ar"
                        >خطابة</foreign> is the word to use, which means ‘philosophical rhetoric’,
                    while when referring to Arab-Islamic rhetoric, <foreign xml:lang="ar"
                        >بلاغة</foreign> is in charge, in the sense of ‘literary rhetoric’ or, as in

                <p xml:lang="en"> The creation of a dictionary of Syriac rhetoric has been a <hi rend="italic"
                        >desideratum </hi>for a long time, and the studies on the migration of words
                    from Greek to both Syriac and Arabic are still in their early days. This study
                    hopes to have shown how a triple focus serves as a key to reconstruct the
                    history of the transmission of words and can be used as a powerful philological
                    tool. Moreover, having the chance to study rhetorical loanwords in the light of
                    Brock’s diachronic researches on Syriac derivational strategies might add new
                    evidences to the data we already possess.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn83"
                        n="83"><p rend="footnote text"> See S.P. Brock, “Diachronic aspects of

                            concerns “native” Syriac neologisms, one can easily make good use of it
                            even with loanwords, since Brock’s categories apply to this field as
                            well. Moreover, the creation of calques based on Greek words, which use
                            Syriac derivational suffixes, can be easily spotted in Syriac rhetorical
                            lexis as well. On this topic see, for instance, one of the possible

                    trilingual perspective that, eventually, will help in shedding new light on what

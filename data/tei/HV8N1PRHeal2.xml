            <anchor xml:id="P1"/>[1] This
    report marks the publication on DVD-ROM of a collection of
    thirty-three electronic facsimiles of Syriac manuscripts from
    the Vatican Library. Further details, including how to order
    the DVD-ROM are available at the project's website (<ref target="http://cpart.byu.edu/Vatican">http://cpart.byu.edu/Vatican</ref>).<ref target="#FN1">1</ref>
         </p>
         <head xml:id="S1">Background</head>
         <p rend="n"> This project is focused on
    the Syriac manuscripts of the Biblioteca Apostolica Vaticana, a
    collection that extends to over 850 manuscripts, including the
    collection of 181 formerly at the Borgian Museum.<ref target="#FN2">2</ref> The collection
    began to grow significantly in the early 18th century. Pope
    Clement XI encouraged a number of successful missions to Egypt
    and elsewhere in the Middle East to acquire manuscripts.
    Through the efforts of Elias Assemani, his cousin J. S.
    Assemani, and Gabriel Eva, some of the most significant of all
    surviving Syriac manuscripts were acquired in this period.</p>
         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P3"/>[3] In 1999
    Mar Bawai Soro, a bishop of the Assyrian Church of the East,
    began discussions with the Vatican Library to make their Syriac
    collections more accessible both to scholars as well as to the
    communities who produced these texts. Mar Bawai approached
    Brigham Young University to be a partner in the project, a
    proposal that was eagerly received. The idea of a pilot project
    was formulated by the parties and a contract between BYU and
    the Vatican Library was signed in early 2000. The manuscript
    photography was undertaken in two phases, one in June 2000 and
    another in April 2002.</p>
         <head xml:id="S2">Report</head>
         <p rend="n"> The project was formulated
    with the kind assistance of academics working in the field of
    Syriac studies and was carried out with direction from a small
    advisory group (Professor Sidney Griffith, Professor Samir
    Khalil and Mar Bawai Soro (Assyrian Church of the East)). Dr.
    Sebastian Brock made an initial assessment of the collection,
    which resulted in a list of especially significant manuscripts
    (Appendix 1 below). From this list, Mar Bawai Soro selected 28
    for a pilot project, which was later supplemented by 5
    additional manuscripts.</p>
         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P5"/>[5] The
    project proposal was originally modeled on BYU's Dead Sea
    Scrolls database. This database gives precedence to a
    searchable transcription of the scrolls and includes both the
    images and corresponding translations in the final product.
    Plans were therefore made to transcribe the manuscripts, and
    two teams were put in place, one for manuscripts written in the
    East Syriac script and one for manuscripts written in the
    Estrangelo and Serto scripts. This proved to be a not
    altogether appropriate model and a new approach was formulated
    as will be discussed below.</p>
         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P6"/>[6] The
    photography was undertaken in two stages. In both stages we
    were able to set up a controlled studio environment, including
    camera stands, full lighting sets and back-up systems. The
    first stage of photography (June 2000) was undertaken using a
    Kodak MegaPlus camera with an array of 2x3k, producing 6
    megapixal images. These grey-scale images were stored
    immediately after capture on Mitsui Gold CDs. The archival
    copies are in TIFF format and are approximately 6 megabytes
    each. A second set of these CDs was made on returning to BYU.
    In the second stage of photography (April 2002) we used a Canon
    EOS 1D, which captured full color 4 megapixal images. These
    images were also archived in uncompressed TIFF format, with
    each image being approximately 25 megabytes in size.</p>
         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P7"/>[7] In the
    two stages of photography we captured a total of 14,700 images,
    which occupy 196 CD-ROMS, with a total archival data size of
    117,600 megabytes. One manuscript alone, Vatican Syriac 117,
    required 50 CD-ROMS to produce the archival copy.</p>
         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P8"/>[8] Further
    to the conventional photography we also undertook a series of
    tests using Multi-Spectral Imaging on Vatican Syriac 110, 114,
    117, 147, 252, and 586. Thus far these tests have produced no
    beneficial results, though further analysis of the data is
    underway.</p>
         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P9"/>[9] All
    digital photographs require processing. Furthermore, the
    uncompressed images were prohibitively large to view easily, so
    some compression was necessary. We opted for JPEG compression
    at a rate of 50%. We considered this to be optimal, since it
    produced a significantly smaller image with very little
    degradation of image quality. An initial stage of processing
    was necessary prior to compressing the images. In most cases
    the manuscripts were captured in a double page opening. We
    therefore cropped all of the images down to a single page and
    ran each image through a series of adjustments in Adobe
    Photoshop; a process that was successfully automated. The
    images were then brought into the Adobe PDF format for
    presentation. Further image manipulation is possible, though we
    did not consider the necessary expenditure of time to be
    prudent. Scholars who wish to undertake more sophisticated
    manipulation of particular manuscripts can request copies of
    the uncompressed images.</p>
         <p rend="nn">
            <anchor xml:id="P10"/>[10]
    After a number of meetings with digital projects specialists at
    the BYU library, it was determined that the Adobe PDF format
    would be the best format to deliver the images. Though initial
    plans had pointed towards the use of BYU's own WordCruncher
    program as the best finished format, it quickly became clear
    that such an approach was impractical. A number of other
    image-only solutions were considered, but each of these proved
    less desirable than Adobe PDF.</p>
         <p rend="nn">
            <anchor xml:id="P11"/>[11] The
    advantages of the PDF format are numerous. In particular,
    because Adobe PDF was designed to view continuous documents and
    books, it reproduces an environment that is familiar to
    readers. One can navigate easily between pages, magnify the
    images, and arrange the screen in such a way that the images
    may be viewed simultaneously with other programs. It is also
    becoming a standard document format in both a business and
    academic context, with many libraries delivering documents in
    this format. Also, the Adobe Reader is freely available and
    constantly being improved by the developer.</p>
         <p rend="nn">
            <anchor xml:id="P12"/>[12] In
    order to make a number of PDF files available on the same DVD,
    we designed and developed a simple interface which runs
    immediately on inserting the disc. This interface includes an
    overview of the project and a table of contents. The table of
    contents contains links to thirty-three PDF files. Each of
    these files contains an electronic facsimile of a single
    Vatican manuscript. The PDF files are identified by the
    manuscript number and a brief description. When the file opens,
    the first thing shown is an index to the manuscripts prepared
    on the basis of the existing catalogs. To these basic entries
    we have added references to editions and standard reference
    works that have been published subsequent to the original
    catalog entry. Each entry in the index also serves as a
    hyperlink. Clicking on an entry immediately takes one to the
    place in the manuscript to which that index entry refers. Also,
    for ease of reference we have included the original catalog
    entry immediately after our index.</p>
         <head xml:id="S3">General Assessment of the Project</head>
         <p rend="nn"> This project has been
    undertaken over a four year period. During that time the
    objectives of the project have shifted and settled. The initial
    project description was modeled on our successful Dead Sea
    Scrolls project and focused on the utility of searchable
    transcribed texts. The Dead Sea Scrolls database contains about
    1300 images, many of which contain only fragmentary texts. This
    project involves a corpus ten times that size. In addition to
    the difference in size and concomitant feasibility of such a
    project, there was the question of desirability and optimal
    presentation. It soon became clear from consultation with other
    scholars that the most needed result from this project was a
    usable set of images from the manuscripts. In other words,
    scholars wanted electronic facsimiles. There is of course a
    great desire for a database of searchable texts, but such a
    project needs to be organized along the lines of a discrete
    corpus of a single author, and based on critical editions
    rather than on an eclectic collection of manuscripts. We have
    therefore reconfigured the project to actively meet the needs
    of the field, and intend to re-purpose the extensive
    transcription work that we have undertaken.</p>
         <p rend="nn">
            <anchor xml:id="P14"/>[14] Not
    only have our objectives been clarified, but we have also seen
    the technological landscape entirely shift. When we began this
    project, we used specialist industrial grey-scale digital
    cameras. In the intervening years, this equipment has been
    thoroughly superceded. The second stage of photography used the
    best available professional color digital SLR. This camera has
    also been superceded several times over. Though technology will
    of course continue to improve, we think we have now reached the
    stage where the available technology will produce images of an
    optimal quality. It is also clear that we will only want to
    take color images in future projects and that it may be
    desirable for some of the manuscripts to be re-imaged in color.
    Nevertheless, with respect to the necessary technology this is
    a highly propitious time to continue this important
    project.</p>

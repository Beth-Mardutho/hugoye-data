    "Kurisumala Ashram" has several unique characteristics.
    "Kurisu" is the translation of the word <hi rend="italic">Cross</hi>, into
    Malayalam the language of Kerala, the small State in the South
    West tip of India; "Mala" means <hi rend="italic">mountain</hi>; "Ashram" means
    <hi rend="italic">Monastery</hi>. Hence, the name describes the community of
    monks who practise austerity and live a strict monastic life on
    the mount of the Cross in the high hills of Kerala.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P2"/>[2] That this monastic
    foundation is in the diocese of Tiruvalla of the Syro-Malankara
    Catholic Church is a paradox. There are three distinct
    individual churches of the Catholic Communion in Kerala. The
    largest and most flourishing is the Syro-Malabar Church. The
    Roman Catholic Church comes next and the Malankara Church is
    the smallest and youngest consisting mostly of uniates from the
    Syrian Orthodox Church. The founders of the Ashram, Fr. Bede
    Griffiths and Acharya Francis Mahieu, should normally have
    chosen to establish the monastery in any one of the several
    archdioceses or dioceses of the Malabar Church which has
    plentiful vocations to the priesthood and religious life. It
    can only be considered a very special blessing of God granted
    to the Malankara Catholic Church that Kurisumala Ashram is in
    the diocese of Tiruvalla of that Church.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P3"/>[3] Fr. Bede
    Griffiths, the eminent scholar and author, spent the last years
    of his life at Shantivanam in Tamilnadu. Thus, Fr. Francis
    Mahieu became the lone guiding spirit of the Ashram at
    Kurisumala. Prior to his arrival in India he was a Cistercian
    Monk in his native Belgium. In India he embraced the best
    aspects of Indian spirituality and culture. It is a measure of
    his total commitment to local adaptation that he acquired a
    mastery knowledge of Syriac, the original language of the
    Malankara Syrian liturgy. He was able to translate from Syriac
    into English a few of the most important liturgical texts such
    as the <hi rend="italic">Panqitho</hi>, the worship book for feast days
    throughout the year. In the monastery, the liturgical services
    are in the Malankara tradition. On an experimental basis, with
    the official sanction of ecclesiastical authorities, there is
    an Indianised celebration of the Holy Mass. In this, the
    chants, ceremonies and symbols are mostly adapted from the
    Hindu form of worship. This practice bears testimony to the
    genuine respect and appreciation that Fr. Francis had of Indian
    culture and religions. He always endeavoured to nurture this
    attitude in the entire Kurisumala monastic community and to
    transmit it to the countless devotees of various Christian
    denominations and other religions who regularly reach the
    monastery for prayer and meditation. A couple of years ago, Fr.
    Francis prudently had the Kurisumala Ashram affiliated with the
    Cistercian Confederation in Australia.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P4"/>[4] When Fr. Francis
    Mahieu was called to eternal rest and happiness with the Lord
    in the 91st year of his life on January 31, 2002, the esteem
    and admiration he earned among all sections of people of this
    country became evident. His funeral was attended by large
    numbers of people from every caste, class and religion. The
    large number of religious sisters of various Congregations was
    particularly conspicuous. They are beneficiaries of the
    atmosphere and spirit of prayer, silence and mortification at
    Kurisumala.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P5"/>[5] The brilliant
    beacon set by Fr. Francis on the mount of the Cross will
    continue to shine and to enlighten generations to come.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P6"/>[6] Francis Acharya
    was very much interested in SEERI (St. Ephrem Ecumenical
    Institute, Kottayam, Kerala, India). He promoted its vision and
    mission. By sending Syriac prayer books for Lent, Holy week
    etc. he requested SEERI to bring the unfulfilled dream of
    Kurisumala into realization- namely the dream of having a
    community where the West Syriac Liturgy will be faithfully
    observed in its original language and this liturgical heritage
    fruitfully studied. In the world Syriac Conferences held in
    SEERI, he was a much coveted speaker and participant. In the
    Acharya's death, SEERI lost an irreplaceable supporter. SEERI
    had the privilege to publish in its <hi rend="italic">Moran Etho</hi> series,
    the inspirational work of Francis Acharya entitled <hi rend="italic">The
    clothing ritual of Monks</hi>.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P7"/>[7] May this great
    monk, devoted follower of West Syrian liturgy and spirituality
    and true lover of India and this country's rich spiritual
    heritage, rest in Abraham's bosom enjoying eternal celestial
    bliss.<lb/>

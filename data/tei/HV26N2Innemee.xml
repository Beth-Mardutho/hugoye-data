                <p xml:lang="en">The research and conservation project of Deir al-Surian was carried
                    out with financial support of the Polish National Center of Science (NCN, grant
                    nr. 2015/18/M/HS3/00621) and the Dioraphte Foundation (The Netherlands). At

                <head>1.Introduction (K.C. Innemée)</head>
                <p xml:lang="en">Since the beginning of the research and conservation work in the
                    church of the Holy Virgin in Deir al-Surian, attempts have been made to map the
                    development of the building’s architecture and decoration (paintings, stucco,
                    woodwork). At first, only a relative chronology could be sketched, based on the
                    stratification of layers of plaster and paintings, but gradually, more and more
                    information came to light that allows scholars to establish a more absolute
                    chronology. Several important modifications and refurbishments of the church
                    were done during the abbacy of Moses of Nisibis, in the first half of the tenth
                    century, and although they cannot all be dated exactly, an increasingly precise
                    image of the activities commissioned by him is slowly taking shape. The
                    modification of the place where the most important church relics were kept and
                    venerated can now be reconstructed based on recently uncovered paintings and a
                    Coptic dipinto. </p>
                <p xml:lang="en">An essential factor in establishing a more absolute chronology is
                    the discovery of several dated inscriptions (dipinti). In some cases, they refer
                    to events that play a role in the history of the monastery and its community and
                    thus serve as an essential source of information. On the other hand, such dated
                    inscriptions can also be used as <hi rend="italic">terminus post quem</hi> for
                    the layers of (painted) plaster that cover(ed) these inscriptions. </p>
                <p xml:lang="en"> The present paper presents three recently discovered inscriptions
                    that are important as documents in the history of the monastic community of Deir
                    al-Surian and provide evidence for dating the layers in the stratification of
                    paintings in the church. Based on these inscriptions, an adjusted overview will
                    be given of the chronology of the phases in the stratification of mural
                    paintings in the church, with particular attention to the eastern wall of the
                    northern side-aisle.</p>

                    <p xml:lang="en">In 2019, a Greek text was found on the first layer of plaster,
                        just right of the doorway in the northern side-aisle. The text contains an
                        annual date, a rare case in the epigraphic corpus from the church. Moreover,
                        the date at the very beginning of the eighth century makes the inscription
                        the earliest dated text from the church and, as such, is a critical
                        chronological anchor for its history in general and for the development of
                        its painted decoration in particular.</p>

                    <p rend="bold">Fig. 1 The funerary inscription of Abba Kuri</p>
                    <p xml:lang="en">The inscription was painted in red and enclosed within a
                        decorative border, also in red (fig. 1). The decoration consists of a zigzag
                        pattern filled in alternately with single dots and wavy vertical lines. Only
                        the lower part of the text has survived, preserving the last ten lines and
                        measuring approximately 22 x 32 cm (together with the border). The border
                        survives almost completely in the bottom, and a small fragment is visible on
                        the right, at the height of lines 5–7. The left borderline is entirely lost,
                        but the text in lines 7–9 appears to be complete; hence, the total width of
                        the composition can be reconstructed at 38 cm. The preservation of the
                        surviving text is not perfect, and the paint is obliterated in many places,
                        especially in the upper and right parts, making the reading very
                        difficult.</p>
                    <p xml:lang="en">The script is distinct and executed by a skilled scribe, but
                        the size of particular letters can differ per line. Palaeographically, the
                        text represents upright epigraphic majuscule with elements of minuscule
                        script, most notably the shape of the <hi rend="italic">mu</hi> (ll. 4 and
                        7) and the <hi rend="italic">alpha</hi> (ll. 4, 5, and 8). Note also the
                        angular shape of the <hi rend="italic">epsilon</hi> (ll. 3, 5, 6, and 8),
                        which can get a more lunar look when the script gets smaller (ll. 8 and 9).
                        The scribe consistently used a supralinear dot to mark the <hi rend="italic"
                            >upsilon </hi>in the final position.</p>
                    <p xml:lang="en">In line 2, two thin, slightly slanting strokes are visible
                        between <foreign xml:lang="gr">δι</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="gr"
                            >ου̣</foreign>. They do not seem to be abbreviation marks or
                        interpunction signs. Instead, they appear to mark off a brake in the text of
                        this line caused by the unusually tall <hi rend="italic">ksi</hi> from line
                        1, the tail of which extends to the upper part of the <hi rend="italic"
                            >kappa</hi> in line 3. The strokes would thus be an <hi rend="italic">ad
                            hoc</hi> typographic device employed by the scribe to amend the mistake
                        in the planning of the text.</p>

                        person (ll. 3–6); the name of the person is in the genitive, which suggests
                        the use of a formula such as “Remember, O God, the falling asleep of NN”,

                    <p xml:lang="en">In 2018, a composition of paintings and an accompanying text
                        were uncovered on the eastern wall of the northern side-aisle. The text was
                        painted in black on two panels enclosed in a red-painted frame, measuring,
                        respectively, 13 by 32 cm and 17 by 30 cm approximately. These two panels
                        are located in the middle of the wall, with two military saints, St
                        Eustathios and St Theodoros Orientalis above and two others, St Jacob the
                        Persian and St Leontios, below (figs. 2-4). Although the panels do not
                        include an exact annual date, they provide an important chronological anchor
                        for dating the painted decoration in the Church of the Virgin. The
                        paleography of the text, with tall letters of book style decorated with
                        serifs and a cross-like central part of the <hi rend="italic">omega</hi>,
                        resembles that of the long inscription running around the central dome of
                        the <hi rend="italic">khurus</hi>. This is all the more so since both texts
                        have the same function, commemorating the persons who supposedly were
                        responsible for decorating both spaces, and they date from the same period
                        (see below). Unfortunately, the left panel is almost completely obliterated
                        in its right part, which makes interpreting the text significantly more
                        difficult. However, considering the inscription’s context, it is possible to
                        propose a reconstruction.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn12" n="12"><p> We owe

                        observes that the three men were representatives of “the monastic

                        above the <hi rend="italic">khurus</hi> was refurbished”. He further notes
                        that they may have been “sponsors of the operation”, but concludes that –
                        given the state of preservation of the text – their mention rather functions
                        as a means of dating of the event during their service in the

                        the reason for commemorating Moses is mentioned explicitly in the last line

                        notes that analogous verbs are used in Syriac inscriptions in connection
                        with Moses’s activity: <hi rend="italic">isep</hi>, “he took care”, and <hi
                            rend="italic">etḥappaṭ</hi>, “he strove”, with the meaning “he took the
                            initiative”.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn19" n="19"><p> E.g. in the
                                inscription in wood dated 914: <hi rend="italic">isep

                                    batir”; in Brock 2012, 18 one finds “was concerned to

                        that his role here was not as a mere “chronological pointer”, but as the
                        true initiator, founder, and supervisor of the work. The nature of this work
                        is explicitly presented in part A of the text as “these portraits” (<foreign
                            xml:lang="cop">ⲛ̣ⲁⲓⲗⲓⲙⲏⲛ</foreign>), most logically the painted
                        composition adorning the wall, which the inscription accompanies.<note

                        repeated in line 4 in the phrase “let us be” (<foreign xml:lang="cop"
                            >ⲙⲁⲣⲉⲛϣⲱⲡ̣ⲓ̣</foreign>) and thus perhaps meaning the whole monastic
                        community, executed these paintings “above this beautiful image”. These
                        portraits “received” – which must mean something like “represented” or
                            “reproduced”<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn21" n="21"><p> We again thank

                        – “the members of their [holy] body”. The unnamed “they” undoubtedly refers
                        to the four military saints identified in the painting. The expression
                        “members of their body”, although it should naturally be considered a
                        euphemism for human figures painted on the wall, seems a little bizarre in
                        the given context. However, there seems to be a plausible explanation for
                        its use here. As we believe, the wooden reliquary discussed above, adorned
                        with the figures of the same saints as those represented on the wall, was
                        most probably originally displayed and venerated in this very space. Thus,
                        should this be the case, the phrase could be treated literally as a
                        reference to the actual body parts of the saints enclosed in the box.<note

                        The script would fit in the ninth or the tenth century. Even though it is
                        not very regular and a bit uneven, it betrays the hand of an experienced
                        writer, who may have found it more challenging to write on the plaster of a
                        wall than on parchment. The ink is black and thick. </p>

                        outline of the message that is being conveyed: 1) it is about “this
                        monastery” (line 3), i.e., Deir al-Surian; 2) there is a date (line 3 and
                        possibly 4); 3) the title “God-clad” occurs, which usually is used for
                        patriarchs; the names of two patriarchs may have been present. Each of these
                        topics require further explanation. </p>

                    <p xml:lang="en">The same expression occurs in other inscriptions in Deir
                        al-Surian. One example is the inscription reporting on the building of the
                        monastery in 818/9,<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn27" n="27"><p> Van Rompay
                                and Innemée, 2020-2022, Inscription A. </p></note> where “this
                        monastery” (line 9 – the phrase is followed by the official name of the
                        monastery) is the object of the building activities. Another example is the
                        inscription reporting on the arrival of the patriarchal envoys in 1166/7,
                        who “entered into this monastery” (line 2) carrying the synodical letter
                        from the Syriac-Orthodox patriarch to Egypt.<note place="foot"

                        attributed to our new inscription, even though it remains unknown whether
                        reference is made here to some construction activity or to an event of a
                        different nature. </p>

                        with confidence. This clarity reduces the options for the hundreds to “one

                            (<foreign xml:lang="syr">ܘܡܬܝܢ</foreign>),<note place="foot"

                                160 and 188. </p></note> as the higher numbers (three hundred and
                        higher) require the numeral to precede the hundred (as in English). The
                        letter following <hi rend="italic">mim</hi> most likely is <hi rend="italic"
                            >taw</hi>, as the connection between <hi rend="italic">mim</hi> and the
                        top of <hi rend="italic">taw</hi> is very similar to the way <hi

                        together in <foreign xml:lang="syr">ܒܫܢܬ</foreign> “in the year” on the same line. Additionally, the ink below
                        (what probably is) <hi rend="italic">taw</hi>, may be part of the final <hi
                            rend="italic">nun</hi>, thus lending support to the reading <foreign xml:lang="syr">ܘܡܬܝܢ</foreign> “two hundred”. The year 1200 of the Seleucid era (A.Gr.) is

                        700. The Greek commemorative inscription dated to 714 now gives a clear
                        indication. The layer of whitewash on which the text is written is
                        relatively clean. Given the fact that the inscription is next to the
                        entrance of the church, a place where one can expect wear, tear, and grime
                        from the hands of people moving in and out, the conclusion can be drawn that
                        it was exposed for a relatively short period, after which the dado covered
                        it. In other words, it seems safe to date the dado to shortly after 714. In
                        the course of the eighth century the upper parts of the walls would be
                        gradually decorated with representations of saints painted in the encaustic
                        technique and finally the Christological/Mariological cycle of paintings

                    <p xml:lang="en">On the eastern wall of the central nave, several additions were
                        made, probably in the tenth century, by locally overplastering the
                        seventh/eighth-century layer and adding several figures. In the upper part
                        of the wall the fragments of the additions that have survived are too
                        disconnected to identify the figures, but in the lower part, many paintings
                        could be identified by their captions. Only part of these paintings have
                        been uncovered so far, so it is too early for final conclusions, but it
                        seems clear that several Syriac and Coptic patriarchs have been depicted. To
                        the left of the doorway to the <hi rend="italic">khurus</hi> there is a
                        painting with the inscription <foreign xml:lang="gr">ἄββα Ἰωσήφ</foreign>.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn51"
                            n="51"><p> There was a Syriac-Orthodox patriarch, Joseph who had a very

                        calligraphic text in Syriac that reads “Saintly Cyriacus, Patriarch of

                        added in white paint in a somewhat improvised way, is still clearly visible,
                        while the figure of the father is covered by the wooden doorjamb of the door
                        that separates the <hi rend="italic">khurus</hi> from the nave. On the
                        opposite side, in the right intrados, there is a figure that could not yet
                        be identified and is equally covered by the right doorjamb. To the right,
                        there is another figure, still covered by a later layer of plaster, but with
                        an accompanying inscription that reads [ἄ]ββ[α] Δ[ι]ον[ύ]σιος. These three
                        figures do not have the epithet ἅγιος and do not show a typically monastic
                        outfit, as far as their costumes are visible, so they likely represent
                        patriarchs, contemporary or from a recent past. Dionysius of Antioch
                        (818-845) and Ya῾qub of Alexandria (819-830) are mentioned in the
                        inscriptions of the Takritan brothers Mattay and Ya῾qub and of Abraham and
                        Theodoros as those patriarchs who were in office during the restoration work
                        that is commemorated by the texts.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn53" n="53"

                        (793-817) was the predecessor of Dionysius. In all likelihood, we are
                        dealing not with contemporary representations of these patriarchs but with a
                        list of portraits created approximately a century later. The difference in
                        style and technique in these ´portraits´ could mean that they were not made
                        simultaneously. For instance, the calligraphy of Cyriacus´ name may have
                        been done at a relatively late moment as a substitute for a figurative
                        representation for which there was not enough space available. On the second
                        layer of plaster/whitewash (eighth century), on the right side of the
                        intrados between nave and khurus, a fragmentary Syriac inscription can be
                        distinguished, partly covered by the (yet unidentified) figure on the third
                        layer. </p>
                    <p xml:lang="en">The succession of phases as visible in this part of the church
                        would mean that at least two changes in the appearance of the archway
                        between nave and <hi rend="italic">khurus</hi> took place within a
                        relatively short period. After 888/9, a commemorative inscription in Syriac
                        (see 2.3.) was written on the still blank plaster. At an unknown moment, the
                        lower part of the eastern wall of the nave, including the intrados, was
                        covered with a layer of whitewash to add paintings. This whitewash may have
                        happened in the early tenth century, when under Moses of Nisibis, paintings
                        were added in several parts of the church. In this way, the inscription
                        disappeared under the painting of a yet unknown figure. This painting, in
                        turn, disappeared out of sight in 926, when the wooden doors commissioned by
                        Moses were placed. The <hi rend="italic">terminus post quem</hi> of 888/9
                        and the <hi rend="italic">terminus ante quem</hi> of 926 between which
                        apparently the paintings on the eastern wall were made, not only give us a
                        valuable and reliable means of dating, but also an impression of how, during
                        the first part of his abbacy, he ordered several embellishments to the
                        interior of the church within a timespan of a few decades. The monumental
                        doors to the sanctuary bear the date of 914,<note place="foot"
                            xml:id="ftn54" n="54"><p> Leroy 1974, 154.</p></note> but the additions
                        of paintings in several parts of the church may have been done earlier. How
                        much earlier remains challenging to say. </p>

                    <p xml:lang="en">This wooden shrine with ivory inlay is most likely to be from
                        the same workshop in which the doors between <hi rend="italic">khurus</hi>
                        and sanctuary and between the nave and <hi rend="italic">khurus</hi> were
                        made and can, therefore, be considered a contemporary work of art
                        commissioned by Moses of Nisibis as well. It seems pretty likely that this
                        shrine had its place where, in the eighteenth century, the <hi rend="italic"
                            >maqsura</hi> was constructed, and evidence for this has recently come
                        to light. The ivory inlay on the front of the shrine shows seven standing
                        figures standing in an arcade of seven arches. Although most of the inlay
                        has disappeared, the contours of the figures are still well recognisable,
                        and six of the seven are identified by inlaid texts in Greek. In the middle,
                        there is the Christ Emmanouel (Ἐμμανουήλ), with the Virgin Mary (ἡ ἅγια
                        Μαρία) on his right side, figures that correspond to those in the central
                        panels on the doors to the <hi rend="italic">khurus</hi>. To the left of
                        Christ, there is the figure of St John (ὁ ἅγιος Ἰωάννης; it is not clear
                        whether it refers to the Baptist or the Evangelist). At the far left of the
                        front, St Eustathios (Εὐστάθιος) has been depicted, and to his right, St
                        Theodore (Θεώδορος). The hagiographical traditions concerning the several
                        military saints with this latter name are complicated and intertwined, and
                        it is unclear which one is meant here. The figure on the far right remains
                        anonymous since only the words ὁ ἅγιος have been inlaid, and the name was
                        omitted for an unknown reason. The contours of the lost ivory, however, show
                        that it must have been a military saint with an oval shield in his left
                        hand. Left of him there is a figure called ὁ ἅγιος Ἰάκοβος, also depicted as
                        a military saint. Four saints are depicted on the wall in the niche where
                        the shrine is supposed to have stood. In the upper part on the left, St
                        Eustathios is shown hunting a stag over which a figure of Christ appears in
                        a tondo or a fragment of a heavenly sphere.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn57"

                        identifies this horseman, these particular details of the human-headed snake
                        and the ladder can only point at the <hi rend="italic">Vita</hi> of
                        Theodoros Orientalis, where a vision of a heavenly ladder and a fight with
                        Satan in the form of a snake with a human head are described.<note

                        the lower part of the wall, there must have been a panel or an icon that is
                        no longer there, judging from the contours visible in the tenth-century
                        plaster. On the seventh-century plaster where this panel must have been,
                        what is visible now is a painting of the Virgin Galaktotrophousa, which
                        could mean that the now missing panel or icon was also a representation of
                        the Virgin. The inscription of Moses seems to refer to this now missing
                        panel in the phrase “these portraits, which we have painted above this
                        beautiful image”, implying that the icon already existed at the time of
                        Moses and that it was incorporated into the composition.</p>
                    <p xml:lang="en">On either side of where the panel used to be, there is a
                        standing figure of a military saint, depicted standing frontally, in a
                        military outfit and holding an oval shield. A Coptic inscription identifies
                        the left one as Jacob the Persian, and the right one (by a Greek or Coptic
                        inscription) as St Leontios. This Leontios should be Leontios of Tripoli, a
                        first-century Roman soldier who was martyred for his faith and popular in
                        the region of Antioch. The contours of the figures and the detail that they
                        are holding oval shields makes them look similar to the contours of the two
                        military saints on the far right on the relic chest: ὁ ἅγιος Ἰάκοβος and the
                        anonymous ὁ ἅγιος. Thus, considering the apparent parallelism of the wall
                        paintings and the reliquary, it is nearly certain that the former should be
                        identified with St James the Persian and reasonably probable that the latter
                        is St Leontios. </p>

                    <p xml:lang="en">The inscription in the two text panels between the paintings
                        provides a link between the paintings and the reliquary and shows
                        undisputedly that Moses of Nisibis had a role in commissioning both. The
                        saints whose relics were kept in the shrine were depicted in both the
                        paintings and the ivory inlay, and these parallel representations support
                        their iconographic identification. The sentence “these portraits, which we
                        have painted above this beautiful image, have received the members of their
                        [holy] body” alludes to both the relics and the wall paintings. It is,
                        therefore, possible to make a virtual reconstruction of the situation as it
                        must have existed in the tenth century (fig. 9). In all likelihood, the
                        refurbishing of this corner of the church took place in the period before
                        926/7, after which Moses was absent from the monastery for a considerable
                            time.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn59" n="59"><p> Brock 2012,

                    <p xml:lang="en">Approximately three centuries later, the interior of the church
                        underwent a thorough renovation: the wooden roofs over the side-aisles and
                        return aisle were replaced by brick vaults, blocked windows that had taken
                        the shape of niches were now completely walled up, and the total interior
                        was covered by a fresh layer of plaster that was a few millimetres thick in
                        some places, but several centimetres in some other. New paintings were made
                        throughout the church. The exact date of this operation is unknown, and
                        based on the style of the paintings, an estimation of the first half of the
                        thirteenth century has been made.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn60" n="60"

                                century must have been a period of prosperity for the monastery;

                        relatively precise way. According to a marginal note in a manuscript from
                        the monastery's library, the church was re-consecrated in 1782,<note
                            place="foot" xml:id="ftn61" n="61"><p> Oral information from Father
                                (meanwhile bishop) Martyros.</p></note> and it seems likely that
                        this was done after a critical renovation had been finished. It appears now
                        that this renovation was done in two main phases, of which the last phase
                        was finished in 1782. Before the renovation, all the woodwork in the church
                        was in bad condition, affected by termites. In addition, in the western part
                        of the church, a fire must have caused serious damage to the wooden lintels
                        over the entrance, the columns and piers, and the roof. The charred and
                        burned remains of these wooden elements have been found under the
                        eighteenth-century plaster. It seems that the church's restoration project
                        was interrupted for some time and resumed. These phases are shown by the two
                        superimposed layers of eighteenth-century plaster, the first one of which
                        must have been exposed for only a short period<note place="foot"
                            xml:id="ftn62" n="62"><p> A few dipinti by visitors in Syriac have been

                        century or slightly later. In the meantime, the church was apparently not in
                        use. The French naturalist Charles Sonnini de Manoncourt visited the
                        monastery in 1775, and concerning the church he writes:</p>
                    <cit>
                        <quote>“The ancient Syrian chapel still remains. It is
                        tolerably handsome, and adorned with sculptures, and paintings in fresco. On
                        one of the pillars the names of several Europeans are cut, but those of the
                        French travellers, Baron and Granger, are the only ones I knew. The Cophts
                        do not make use of this chapel; but have built another, after their own
                        fashion, that is, in the form of a cross.”<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn63"
                            n="63"><p> Sonnini 1799, 181.</p></note></quote>
                    </cit>
                    <p xml:lang="en">This Coptic church he mentions is apparently the so-called
                        Church of the Cave, the second church in the monastery. In his description,
                        Sonnini mentions the wall paintings in the Syrian church, from which we can
                        conclude that they were apparently not yet covered with the final layer of
                        plaster. The graffiti of European travellers that he mentions are not
                        visible nowadays, but they may be waiting to be uncovered under the plaster
                        on the masonry piers that are still covered by the final layer of plaster.
                        All this shows that in 1775, the final layer of plaster had not yet been
                        applied.</p>

                <p xml:lang="en">The graffiti and dipinti on the walls of the church of the Holy
                    Virgin in Deir al-Surian (as in so many other monuments), despite their
                    difference in language and character, have in common that they mark moments in
                    time that connect persons and events with the building. The reasons and the
                    occasions for leaving an inscription behind can vary and range from the humble
                    and personal text of a visitor who commemorates his visit in the form of a
                    prayer to the announcement or commemoration of events that are deemed of
                    interest for all who use or visit the church. These texts can be read as a diary
                    of events connected with the church and its congregation. As in an
                    archaeological stratigraphy, the layers of plaster and whitewash on the walls of
                    the church could be compared to the folios of a codex, and ‘reading’ the pages
                    reveals the history of the building and its community. As in a damaged
                    manuscript, these pages are not intact anymore, and many of the events recorded
                    are without a date. The joint efforts of conservators, epigraphists, and art
                    historians can help put a chronological order in shreds of information that tell
                    the history of a church building. The recent finds of (dated) inscriptions in
                    Deir al-Surian have underscored once more the importance of Moses of Nisibis as
                    a church patron. Furthermore, they have narrowed down the number of intervals
                    within which artistic additions to the church have been made. </p>

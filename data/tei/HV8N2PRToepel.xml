         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P1"/>[1] In spite
    of its comparative proximity the modern history of the Church
    of the East remains one of the underdeveloped fields in the
    study of Eastern Christianity. Any publication on this subject
    is, therefore, to be welcomed, and in regard of the book under
    review here this is the more so, since its author, His Grace
    Mar Aprem, Metropolitan of All India, to a great extent not
    only witnessed but shaped the history of the Assyrian Church of
    the East during the last forty years. As is to be expected, the
    book deals first and foremost with the history of this church,
    while the uniate Chaldaean church, which ultimately stems from
    the same tradition, receives only minor attention. After two
    introductory chapters on the origins and history of the
    Assyrian Church until 1900 (pp. 17-67) its history during the
    twentieth century is presented according to a division into
    four periods: a period of decline from 1900 to 1918 (pp.
    69-112), a period of uncertainty from 1918-1933 (pp. 114-164),
    a period of sufferings from 1933-1975 (pp. 166-184) and finally
    the ecumenical era from 1976 to the present (pp. 186-216). The
    book contains several appendices which include documents of
    interest, such as the 1994 Common Christological Declaration of
    Pope John Paul II. and Catholicos Mar Dinkha IV. as well as a
    Joint Synodal Decree of the Assyrian and Chaldaean churches for
    promoting unity among each other from 1997.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P2"/>[2] As the
    distribution of page numbers shows, the major part of the book
    deals with the period from 1900-1933 and it is here that the
    author makes a real contribution by drawing upon the riches of
    the Syriac manuscript libraries in India. Especially on pp.
    117-157 the account is based entirely upon the letters of Mar
    Abimalek Timotheus, Metropolitan of All India from 1908-1945,
    who acted as regent to the young patriarch Eshai Shimun in the
    early 1920's and, during that time, took an active role in the
    politics of his church. Hereby the author opens up an "Indian
    perspective" on Nestorian church history in the twentieth
    century, a perspective which is largely absent in the few
    hitherto available works on this subject. Likewise informative
    is the section on the ecumenical era from 1976 to the present,
    in which the author himself played a significant role and thus
    is able to present an eye-witness account.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P3"/>[3] Apart
    from these issues which are treated in detail, at other points
    there is a potential of deepening the investigation. To begin
    with, the book is purely church-historical in character, which
    means that the political aspect of the narrated events is not
    expressly stated. For the uninformed reader, however, at times
    it would have been useful to include some background
    information. Since Assyrian church history prior to World War I
    took place within the framework of the Ottoman Empire and its
    policies towards religious minorities, a knowledge of the
    <hi rend="italic">millet</hi> system is necessary for understanding some
    peculiarities of this church's history in the 1920's and 30's.
    On p. 158 the patriarch's temporal power is briefly mentioned,
    but it is not made clear how far this claim to civil
    jurisdiction is related to the Ottoman law system. In addition
    it has to be said that the account on pp. 157-159 is—as
    the author on p. 157 n. 65 himself acknowledges—based
    upon an account friendly towards Patriarch Eshai Shimun. In
    fact it seems to have been the case not so much that British or
    Iraqi officials tried to diminish the influence of the
    patriarchal family but rather that the Patriarch himself
    insisted upon retaining (and presumably exercising) his
    temporal power, and that this was the main reason for his
    eventual expulsion from Iraq (cf. J. Joseph, <hi rend="italic">The Nestorians
    and their Muslim Neighbors</hi> [Princeton: Princeton University
    Press, 1961], pp. 198-200; G. Yonan, <hi rend="italic">Assyrer heute</hi>
    [Hamburg: Gesellschaft für bedrohte Völker, 1978],
    pp. 60-61).</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P4"/>[4] The same
    holds true in regard of the Patriarch's relationship to the
    Nestorian military leader Agha Petros, which could have been
    treated in more depth than is actually the case on pp. 116-117,
    157. Especially on p. 157 the Agha's rather dubious role in the
    repatriation attempt of 1919 is not mentioned at all. Another
    issue which carries the potential of more detailed treatment is
    the question of "Assyrian" nationalism. In the title and
    throughout the book the term "Assyrian" is used as a
    denominational marker in accordance with this church's official
    usage since the 1940's (cf. Yonan, <hi rend="italic">Assyrer</hi>, p. 154). It
    is, however, to be regretted that the background of this term,
    which originally was applied in an ethnic sense, is not
    explored in greater detail, especially since the works by J.
    Joseph and J. F. Coakley (cf. Joseph, <hi rend="italic">Nestorians</hi>, pp.
    13-21; J. F. Coakley, <hi rend="italic">The Church of the East and the Church
    of England</hi> [Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1992], p. 4-6 with n.
    12)—upon which the account on pp. 51-67, 99-110 otherwise
    is heavily dependent—contain lengthy sections on
    this.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P5"/>[5] Finally
    it has to be asked whether—given the fact that
    Mesopotamia at this time was regarded as being vital to British
    imperial interests (cf. D. Fromkin, <hi rend="italic">A Peace to End All
    Peace</hi> [London: André Deutsch, 1989], pp. 146-149,
    449-454, 558-567)—the motive behind the Anglican church's
    "mission of help" (p. 69) was really as altruistic as it is
    presented on pp. 69 and 85. Even in the missionary W. A.
    Wigram's letter to the Archbishop of Canterbury from 1911,
    which is quoted on pp. 96-98, the link between the Church of
    England's missionary work and the political interests of the
    British Empire is made unmistakably clear. In this respect the
    Anglican determination to preserve the Church in the East in
    its original state rather appears as an attempt to keep it from
    falling under Presbyterian, Catholic or Russian Orthodox sway
    and the influence of the countries behind these churches,
    namely the United States, France and Russia. Notwithstanding
    the good intentions of individual churchmen this seems to have
    been a serious motive behind the help which the Assyrians
    received from the Anglican church and the British crown (cf.
    Joseph, <hi rend="italic">Nestorians</hi>, pp. 87-92, 95-107). British military
    interest in the Assyrians is made especially clear by the
    history of the Iraq Levies, which consisted of Nestorian
    tribesmen and played a vital role during the British mandate in
    Iraq and even in World War II (cf. Yonan, <hi rend="italic">Assyrer</hi>, pp.
    56-57, 74-76). These are briefly mentioned on p. 154 in
    connection with the Indian metropolitan Mar Timotheus' failed
    attempt to visit their bases in 1927. In order to understand,
    however, why the British authorities refused to give Mar
    Timotheus, who at this time opposed the Patriarch Eshai Shimun,
    access to their Assyrian levy troops it would have been helpful
    to refer to the political situation outlined just above.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P6"/>[6] For
    clarity's sake it is furthermore necessary to indicate a few
    minor inaccuracies. (p. 30-31) Obviously Rabban Sauma is
    confused with Marqos, later Patriarch Yahballaha III. Marqos
    never visited Rome and therefore cannot have been blessed by
    the pope (p. 31) Here it is stated that after Timur's genocide
    the Church of the East "never had peaceful days". There are,
    however, no massacres reported until 1843 (cf. Joseph,
    <hi rend="italic">Nestorians</hi>, pp. 29-30). (p. 99) Kemal Atatürk was
    not involved in the Young Turk revolution of 1908. The person
    in question here is probably Kemal Pasha. Last but not least an
    index would substantially facilitate the use of the book.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P7"/>[7] These
    points notwithstanding, the book's strength remains that for
    the first time it affords a glimpse into the rich archive
    material in India which for the larger part still awaits
    investigation. By giving access to this material the author
    points towards a dimension of Nestorian church history which
    lies beyond the question of ethnic minorities in the Middle
    East. The book thus not only provides a useful update on the
    history of the Assyrian Church, but draws attention to the
    erstwhile truly ecumenical and global character of the Church
    of the East, which is gradually being recovered today.</p>

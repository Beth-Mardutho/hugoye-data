            <anchor corresp="P1"/>[1] In this
    six-week seminar, participants will study the Aramaic language
    and literature of post-biblical Judaism and early Christianity.
    In the mornings, participants will receive intensive
    instruction in three dialects of Aramaic: Jewish Literary
    Aramaic of first-century Judea and Qumran, Jewish Palestinian
    Aramaic of Galilee in the third century and later, and Syriac,
    used extensively in Eastern Christianity. The Seminar is
    structured so that participants, upon successful completion,
    will have mastered at least one dialect for use in their
    personal research.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P2"/>[2] In the
    evenings, there will be seminars discussing the literature
    written in these dialects and analyzing how that literature can
    be used in historical and religious studies of ancient Judaism
    and Christianity. Topics will include: Dead Sea Scrolls, Bar
    Kokhba, synagogue and ossuary inscriptions, the language of
    Jesus, Targum and Peshitta, rabbinic literature, Dura Europos,
    as well as Ephrem and Aphrahat. One week will be devoted to
    seminars on the history and development of the Aramaic
    language.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P3"/>[3] The
    organizers and principal teachers are: Eric M. Meyers (Duke
    University), Paul V.M. Flesher (University of Wyoming), and
    Lucas Van Rompay (Duke University).</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P4"/>[4] Guest

         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P1"/>[1] Aho
    Shemunkasho's study on <hi rend="italic">Healing in the Theology of Saint
    Ephrem</hi> originated as a dissertation at Oxford University
    under the direction of S.P. Brock. Shemunkasho presents a
    comprehensive picture of Ephrem's theology of spiritual
    sickness and healing, a topic central to the Syrian's thought
    which has not yet been studied comprehensively.</p>
         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P2"/>[2] In the
    Introduction (chapter 1), the author briefly surveys both
    ancient notions of healing and modern studies pertinent to that
    subject, addressing Hippocrates, Asclepius, and Galen, as well
    as biblical and early Christian texts.</p>
         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P3"/>[3] The next
    chapter studies healing imagery in three early Syriac texts
    that originated prior to Ephrem's writings, namely the <hi rend="italic">Odes
    of Solomon</hi>, the <hi rend="italic">Acts of Thomas</hi>, and Aphrahat's
    <hi rend="italic">Demonstrations</hi>. Healing imagery in the <hi rend="italic">Odes</hi> is
    sparse, essentially restricted to the notion that God removed
    sickness from the odist's body. The <hi rend="italic">Acts of Thomas</hi>, on
    the other hand, show a varied terminology of healing and a
    broad usage of the metaphor "physician," which is applied to
    both Jesus and Thomas. Moreover, the expression "Medicine of
    Life," central to Ephrem's theology of healing, occurs in the
    <hi rend="italic">Acts of Thomas</hi>. The third and longest section of this
    chapter discusses in detail Aphrahat's healing terminology and
    theology. Shemunkasho refrains from including any comparative
    observations on these three texts here, but does so briefly in
    the final chapter of the book, where he observes that
    Aphrahat's healing terminology is unique among the texts
    considered in this study, as is his notion of repentance as a
    medicine for those wounded in the spiritual battle of life.</p>
         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P4"/>[4] The
    third chapter, which examines in depth Ephrem's terminology, is
    subdivided into two sections which study the Syrian's
    vocabulary of sickness and of healing, respectively.
    Shemunkasho demonstrates the breadth of Ephrem's terminology
    and offers many insightful observations. He includes
    comparisons between Ephrem's terminology and the Syriac Bible,
    notes the occurrence of certain word fields, and lists those
    important terms which occur only seldom in Ephrem's writings.
    This chapter also introduces the central aspects of Ephrem's
    healing theology.</p>
         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P5"/>[5] The
    following chapter focuses on Ephrem's biblical exegesis,
    discussing passages from both the Old and New Testaments.
    Shemunkasho shows that according to Ephrem Adam and Eve were
    created in a state of health, but without awareness of what
    constitutes sickness or health. As a result of the fall, they
    acquired this knowledge, but also became subject to sickness
    and pain. With the first human beings, all of nature became ill
    as well. Next, the author examines Ephrem's exegesis of leprosy
    accounts (Miriam, Naaman, Gehazi, King Uzziah), noting their
    function in refuting heresy. He also points out Ephrem's
    emphasis on the role of faith, and his positive view of the
    body. The stories of Tamar, Rahab, and Ruth serve to illustrate
    Ephrem's view of how healing through Christ, the Medicine of
    Life, was available to these women who recognized the "hidden
    messianic seed" in their husbands (213). Shemunkasho moves on
    to Ephrem's interpretation of New Testament accounts of
    healing, in particular the healing of the sinful woman in the
    house of Simon the Parisee, of the woman with the hemorrhage,
    and of the blind. In each case, the author includes a helpful
    discussion of the relevant biblical passages and their likely
    version in the Diatessaron. He then offers fine interpretations
    of Ephrem's exegesis of these biblical narratives, elaborating
    on the role of faith in the healing miracles, the role of
    Christ's divinity and humanity, the connection between physical
    and spiritual healing, and other themes.</p>
         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P6"/>[6] Chapter
    five, with over 160 pages the longest of the book, takes up
    elements of the prior chapters on Ephrem and presents
    systematically Ephrem's notion of salvation history as a
    process of healing. The first section, dealing with the cause
    of sickness, takes up elements from the exegetical chapter and
    describes how according to Ephrem the fall brought humankind
    into a state of suffering and pain. The causes of this sickness
    are twofold: Satan's activity and human free will. The serpent,
    Satan's agent, offered the "poison of death" which brought
    humankind into the "state of sickness." This comprises
    physical, spiritual, and mental disease, and for Ephrem also
    error�especially in the form of heresy or idolatry�constitutes
    a kind of sickness.</p>
         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P7"/>[7] The
    following section addresses how according to Ephrem healing was
    effected prior to the incarnation and shows the surprising
    variety of remedies available to humankind before the arrival
    of Christ, the "Medicine of Life." For instance, the fragrance
    of paradise spreads beyond its confines to the "earth of
    thorns" and offers healing. Symbols of Christ, such as Moses�
    brazen serpent, likewise can effect a cure. Patriarchs and
    prophets could act as physicians for certain groups of people.
    Finally, Shemunkasho shows that Ephrem argues that God's law
    and commandments functioned as medicines for particular
    spiritual ills.</p>
         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P8"/>[8] The
    third section of chapter five focuses on Jesus as the "Medicine
    of Life," the only way to achieve a perfect cure. Shemunkasho
    discusses both physical and spiritual healing, and observes
    that according to Ephrem healing continues to be brought by
    Jesus' disciples, by bishops, and through the church's
    sacraments.</p>
         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P9"/>[9] In the
    conclusion, Shemunkasho sums up his results and briefly
    compares Ephrem's healing terminology with that of the <hi rend="italic">Acts
    of Thomas</hi> and Aphrahat. A bibliography completes the
    work.</p>
         <p rend="nn">
            <anchor xml:id="P10"/>[10]
    Shemunkasho accomplishes extremely well what he set out to do:
    the reader here finds a comprehensive and insightful
    presentation of Ephrem's terminology and theology of spiritual
    sickness and healing. The author deliberately excludes any
    comparative aspects from this dissertation—with the exception
    of the three Syriac texts of chapter two—and hence he discusses
    neither the relation between Ephrem's symbolism of healing and
    that of the Greek and Latin fathers, where healing imagery
    likewise abounds, nor the extent of Ephrem's influence upon
    later Syriac healing symbolism. Throughout the book,
    Shemunkasho frequently inserts the relevant Syriac expression
    in parentheses into the running text; the footnotes often
    contain the original Syriac text of cited passages. This
    constant attention to terminology enhances his study, even if
    it might cause difficulty for readers not familiar with Syriac.
    The abundant Syriac passages are carefully typeset, but the
    same can not be said about the Greek healing terminology
    discussed in chapter one. Breathing marks and accents are
    commonly omitted, and a number of typographical errors occur—a
    regrettable but minor oversight in an otherwise carefully done
    study.</p>
         <p rend="nn">
            <anchor xml:id="P11"/>[11]
    Shemunkasho makes a welcome contribution to scholarship on
    Ephrem by taking up a central yet little examined theme of the
    Syrian's theology. He succeeds in showing that Ephrem's healing
    theology is rooted in the Syrian's biblical exegesis. A second
    important result of Shemunkasho's book is that Ephrem's healing
    theology—although the references occur scattered throughout the
    Syrian's works—constitutes indeed a systematic whole. Healing
    imagery permeates Ephrem's writings, and this reflects the
    importance of this theme within Ephrem's theology of
    salvation.</p>

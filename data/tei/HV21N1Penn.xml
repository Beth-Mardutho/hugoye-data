                <p xml:lang="en">As part of a larger digital paleography project, our team has
                    assembled a database of tens of thousands of individual Syriac letters and
                    letter data from 96% of extant early Syriac manuscripts that have a secure
                    composition date. Long term, such data can help scholars develop more accurate
                    ways to classify Syriac scripts. In the present article we use this data to
                    illustrate just how frequently the most common way of categorizing Syriac
                    scripts as either Estrangela or Serto does not accurately convey the ways early
                    scribes actually wrote. In addition to challenging this “Standard Model” of
                    Syriac scripts, the project illustrates how large data sets, digital analysis,
                    and visual analytics can help researchers address key philological and
                    historical problems.</p>

            <p xml:lang="en">Ruben Duval’s 1881 <hi rend="italic">Traite Syriaque</hi> begins with a
                series of charts outlining the development of Syriac script. These charts divide the
                language into three scripts, a much later “Nestorian” script and—the focus of the
                present paper—two earlier scripts. According to Duval, the original Syriac script
                was Estrangela and, starting in the eighth century, there appeared a derived script
                that Duval termed “Jacobite” but is more commonly known as Serto. Duval was not the
                first scholar to divide early Syriac into these mutually exclusive script styles;
                similar divisions are extant among tenth-century Arabic writers and also appear in
                the thirteenth-century Syriac writings of Bar Hebreaus.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn2" n="2">

                This terminology was later adopted by most scholars of Syriac and, by the late
                nineteenth century, this schema was so well known that even the Victorian novelist
                George Eliot referred to Estrangela in her notebooks.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn3" n="3">

            <p xml:lang="en">Since the nineteenth century, our knowledge of the Syriac language has
                advanced immensely. But, when it comes to our categories of Syriac script, these
                have remained essentially the same. Consider, for example,
                <hi rend="italic" xml:space="preserve">Figure </hi>1. On the left is the Syriac
                section of the script chart Duval published in 1881. To the right appears a 2016
                script chart found in the most recently published Syriac text book.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn4" n="4">

                </note> In almost
                all details these are identical. They show three scripts, Estrangela, Serto (aka.
                Jacobite), and the much later East Syrian (aka. Nestorian). For the focus of this
                paper, Estrangela and Serto, there is little morphological variation between certain
                letters (e.g. zayn, nun). For a number of letters, however, there is substantial
                variation between the two scripts (i.e. olaph, dolath, he, waw, mim, rish, taw, and
                final lomahd).<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn5" n="5">
                    <p rend="footnote text"> Final
                        ayn could also be added to this list. But, because a final ayn appears so
                        infrequently in Syriac, it was not feasible for us to identify a final ayn
                        in every document. Our preliminary analysis suggests, however, that a scribe
                        that uses an E final lomadh also uses an E final ayn and a scribe who uses
                        an S final lomadh also uses an S final lomadh. The mim undergoes at least
                        two substantial changes over time: 1) the earliest book hands usually have
                        an open form of the mim in which they maintain a small opening on the
                        baseline (just as they do a waw); 2) long after a closed form of the mim
                        becomes popular, it further changes shape with a loop on the right and a
                        left arm that meets the baseline making a v-shape on top. Because of our
                        interest in earlier manuscripts, we have focused on the first of these
                        changes and are defining an E mim as having an opening on the base line.
                        There are also several letters, particularly gomal, teth, qoph, and shin
                        that develop a substantially rounder form over time. But among securely
                        dated manuscripts these more rounded forms do not clearly appear until the
                        twelfth century and therefore are not the focus of this paper.</p>
                </note> As
                both the 1881 and 2016 script charts suggest, what makes these categories so
                appealing is how easily one can differentiate them from each other. For those
                letters that show variance, an Estrangela document will only have Estrangela letter
                forms (what we will call E forms). For those letters that show variance, a Serto
                document will only have Serto letter forms (what we call S forms). The history of
                these scripts is often depicted as equally simple. Estrangela came first. Serto
                suddenly emerged in the eighth century as a more cursive form of Estrangela that
                eventually surpassed its parent in popularity. </p>
            <p xml:lang="en">Appearing in introductory Syriac text books, these tables were
                primarily intended for beginning students to use when they encountered printed text,
                not manuscripts. Indeed, these script charts work fairly well for printed text and
                even for most manuscripts written after the thirteenth century. In recent years,
                several scholars have noted the limitations of applying such a schema to early
                manuscripts. Nevertheless, no alternative model has gained general acceptance. As a
                result, what appears in introductory text books is also commonly used for early
                manuscripts. In other words, the text book model has become essentially the Standard
                Model. The resulting schema of clearly and exclusively defined Estrangela and Serto
                remains the main paradigm for classifying Syriac script. It is found, with very
                little deviation, not only in almost every modern text book of Syriac, but also in
                most manuscript catalogs, in the only substantial paleographic resource in the
                field, and even in that most important arbiter of world knowledge, Wikipedia.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn6" n="6">

                        a comprehensive list of catalogs see http://syri.ac/manuscripts). This clear
                        divide between Estrangela and Serto can even be found in the Wikipedia

                The problem with an all-purpose Standard Model derived from introductory text book
                script charts is clearly not obscurity. The problem with such a Standard Model is
                that when one applies it to early Syriac manuscripts, in almost every aspect it is
                simply dead wrong. </p>
            <p xml:lang="en">As can be seen in <hi rend="italic">Figures</hi> 2 and 3, in addition
                to its general success when applied to modern printed text, the Standard Model does
                indeed work well for some manuscripts. <hi rend="italic">Figure</hi> 2 follows a
                page from <hi rend="italic">British Library Additional</hi> 14,428 (securely dated
                to 500 CE) which matches the text book definition of Estrangela. The olaph, dolath,
                he, waw, mim, rish, taw, and final lomadh match the text book charts of Estrangela
                forms, that is they are what we call the E forms. <hi rend="italic">Figure</hi> 3

                20b (securely dated to 886 CE) which matches the text book charts of Serto. All the
                variable letters are in what we are calling the S forms and match what text books
                attribute to Serto. In other words, the text book script charts originally designed
                for printed texts also work for these manuscripts. In such cases, it remains
                unproblematic to use the text book chart as an all-purpose Standard Model. But
                anyone who looks at even a small number of early Syriac manuscripts must confront
                many unlike those in <hi rend="italic">Figures</hi> 2 and 3. One frequently
                encounters cases where the text book script charts do not at all jive with what is
                being read. Such manuscripts illustrate the problem with misapplying script charts
                initially designed for printed text as an all-purpose Standard Model of Syriac
                script. </p>
            <p xml:lang="en">We are far from the first to notice this. Those who work directly with

                This database of more than 60,000 individual letter images allows one to better

                common way early Syriac manuscripts are classified. We employ two distinct datasets

                each of these manuscripts, research assistants used a custom-designed Java interface
                to identify for the computer six to ten examples of each Syriac letter form. The
                letter selections were proofed by a Syriac scholar, given appropriate metadata,
                binarized, and digitally trimmed to remove any stray marks. The computer then helped
                scholars visualize these tens of thousands of letter images through the creation of
                automatic, customizable script charts. The charted letter forms we used for this
                paper’s analysis were also cross-checked with the original manuscript images to
                ensure accuracy. There was, however, a smaller number of securely dated manuscripts
                for which we were unable to obtain digital images but that did appear in previously
                published images. For example, in 2006 the Cincinnati Historical Society sold the
                manuscript known as <hi rend="italic">Codex Syriacus Secundus</hi> (dated 882 CE) to
                a private collector. Although we were unsuccessful in obtaining images directly from

                manuscripts. We also obtained images from an additional 593 manuscripts in the
                British Library collection that the nineteenth-century cataloger William Wright
                estimated were written between the fifth and eleventh centuries. These manuscripts
                do not contain a securely dated colophon and there is not yet a way to confirm the
                accuracy of Wright’s estimates. Therefore, we do not use these manuscripts to
                establish a chronology of Syriac script development. Nevertheless, these undated
                manuscripts do allow one to use the world’s largest holding of early Syriac
                manuscripts as a case study to further quantify how often the Standard Model fails
                to accurately describe Syriac manuscript script. </p>
            <p xml:lang="en">Combined, this forms a collection of 768 manuscripts whose analysis
                reveals at least four systemic flaws in using the Standard Model for classifying
                Syriac scripts in early manuscripts: 1) A given scribe often used both E and S forms
                of the very same letter in the very same manuscript; 2) A given scribe often used E
                forms of some letters and S forms of other letters in the very same manuscript; 3)
                Several S letters first appeared long before the eighth century; 4) Even a survey of
                a small number of Syriac specialists shows how frequently they disagree on how to
                classify actual manuscripts using the prevailing nomenclature. Although previous
                scholars have alluded to a number of these issues, we hope that our more systematic
                and quantitative analysis will help convince the Syriac community of the necessity
                for a new classification system for manuscript script. </p>

                both E and S Forms of the Same Letter within a Single Manuscript </p>
            <p xml:lang="en">According to the Standard Model, any given document should use either
                an E or an S form of a given letter. No text book has a chart of Estrangela that
                includes examples of S forms of an olaph, dolath, he, waw, mim, rish, taw, or final
                lomadh. No text book has a chart of Serto that includes an E form of an olaph,
                dolath, he, waw, mim, rish, taw, or final lomadh. According to these tables and
                their descriptions, if one finds a document using an E olaph, every other olaph the
                document used would also take an E form. If a document uses an S rish, every other
                rish in that document should also be an S form. </p>
            <p xml:lang="en">The first challenge to applying this Standard Model to early
                manuscripts is that in many cases a single manuscript hand will contain both the E
                and S forms of the very same letter, usually on the very same page, often in the
                very same word. For example, <hi rend="italic">Figure</hi> 5 shows a page from <hi rend="italic">British Library Additional</hi> 14,548 securely dated to 790 CE.
                Upon first glance, this manuscript appears to match the Standard Model of Serto. It
                contains S forms of olaph, dolath, he, waw, mim, rish, and taw. However, upon a
                closer look, it is clear that the E form of olaph is also present. </p>
            <p xml:lang="en">As <hi rend="italic">Figure</hi> 6 shows, the scribe of <hi rend="italic">British Library Additional</hi> 14,548 was far from alone in using
                both E and S forms of olaph. Here securely dated manuscripts are represented
                chronologically from left to right. If more than one scribe contributed to a
                manuscript, the chart treats each hand independently. For each manuscript hand, a
                dot shows whether the scribe used only E forms of the olaph, S forms of the olaph,
                or both E and S forms of the olaph<hi rend="Hyperlink">.</hi>

                <hi rend="Hyperlink" xml:space="preserve"> Every dot in the “both” row defies a cardinal rule of the Standard Model for Syriac script.</hi>
            </p>
            <p xml:lang="en">These are not occasional occurrences. No less than 53 of the 175
                securely dated manuscript hands we examined display at least one Syriac letter in
                both its E and S form. This becomes especially prevalent between the ninth and
                eleventh centuries, when 38% of securely dated manuscripts show such overlap. These
                violations of the Standard Model are not, however, just confined to these later
                centuries. For example, as is well known, even the earliest securely dated Syriac
                manuscript, <hi rend="italic">British Library Additional</hi> 12,150 (411 CE), has
                both E and S dolaths and rishs. Such appearance of both E and S letter forms cannot
                be explained by a change in scribes; the letter forms appear to come from a singular
                hand, are found on the same page, and often two forms of the same letter occur
                within the very same word. In addition to these securely dated examples, our team’s
                collection of 593 British Library manuscripts that Wright estimated as having been
                written in the fifth through tenth century includes no less than 169 further cases
                of a scribe using both E and S forms of the same letter. Most often a scribe will
                use both the E and S forms of an olaph (often as an aid for line justification), but
                both forms of dolath, he, rish, and taw also appear in some manuscript hands. </p>
            <p xml:lang="en">A key component of text book script charts and their application as a
                Standard Model is that Estrangela and Serto are separate categories that do not
                overlap with each other. Yet for almost every variable letter, one finds multiple
                cases of a single hand employing both an E and an S form. The numerous examples of
                scribes using E and S forms of the same letter within a given manuscript, often even
                within a given word, defies the logic behind two exclusive categories of early
                Syriac scripts. Even if such a system might work for modern printed text or for
                relatively late manuscripts, it certainly does not for earlier manuscripts. </p>

                this does not work well for early manuscripts. Here E forms of certain letters and S

                Although not as useful as securely dated manuscripts for tracing the chronological
                development of Syriac script, our dataset of 593 manuscripts that Wright estimated
                were written before the twelfth century also illustrates the prevalence of
                mixed-script manuscripts. As can be seen in <hi rend="italic">Figure</hi> 11, 220
                manuscripts, that is 38% of the total sample, contain E forms of some letters and S
                forms of others in the same manuscript. More detailed analysis of securely dated
                examples indicates that this problem only compounded over time. In the fifth and
                sixth centuries, only seven securely dated manuscripts have mixed E and S forms,
                constituting 14% of the manuscripts from that period. The number of mixed-script

            <p xml:lang="en">The alleged eighth-century birth of Serto becomes even more problematic
                when one discovers that S forms developed at different times, often well before the

                substantiates this point with the appearance of the S forms of dolath and rish in
                411 CE. Dolath and rish are the first S forms found in the main text of a manuscript
                and of the securely dated manuscripts produced before the eighth-century, 11%

            <p xml:lang="en"> He, waw, and mim were the next letters to appear in their S form among
                securely dated manuscripts. Although earlier securely dated manuscripts occasionally

                the S forms of dolath, rish, he, waw, and mim but E forms of olaph and taw. An S
                form he is found in six of the 61 manuscripts securely dated to before the eighth
                century, that is in 10% of all securely dated manuscripts produced before the
                supposed development of the Serto script. Similarly, 8% of all securely dated
                manuscripts made prior to the 700s used the S form of waw and mim. </p>
            <p xml:lang="en">In total, 16% of securely dated manuscripts produced before 700 CE
                contain at least one S form of the letters dolath, he, waw, mim, and rish. In
                contrast the S forms of olaph, taw, and final lomadh in the main text of a securely
                dated manuscript do not occur until significantly later, first appearing in <hi rend="italic">Berlin Syriac</hi> 26 dated to 740 CE., two centuries after the
                first appearance of the S forms of he, waw, and mim. The S olaph, taw, and final
                lomadh do not, however, become common until much later when 59% of all securely
                dated manuscripts produced in the ninth century and tenth centuries use the S form
                olaph. The taw shows a similar pattern, with 51% of all securely dated ninth- and
                tenth-century manuscripts using the S form.</p>
            <p xml:lang="en">The Standard Model obscures a much more complicated history of Syriac
                script. Among the main text of securely dated manuscripts, there are four distinct
                points in which different S letter forms first appear: 411 CE (dolath, rish),
                599/600 CE (he, waw, and mim), 740 CE (olaph) and 790 CE (taw, final lomadh). Rather
                than suddenly emerging in the eighth century, the letter forms that make up the
                Standard Model’s definition of Serto all appear at different times and the majority
                first appear long before the 700s. </p>
            <p xml:lang="en">Even this story, however, has to be substantially qualified. For up to
                now we have been dealing exclusively with the history of Syriac book hand which was
                used to copy the main text of a manuscript. In 2000, John Healey and, in 2005,
                Fraçoise Briquel-Chatonnet noted that many of the letter forms associated with Serto
                did not first appear in the main text of Syriac manuscripts. Rather, their earliest
                attestation can be seen in Syriac mosaics, a collection of three third-century
                Syriac documentary papyri, and five examples of securely dated manuscripts in which
                an early scribe wrote the main text only with E forms, but then wrote the
                manuscript’s colophon in a more current hand using one or more S forms.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn17" n="17">

                than Estrangela. Instead, from the very beginning, Syriac had multiple script
                styles. A more monumental script, what we generally call Estrangela, was used for
                both inscriptions and as a book hand. At the same time, a more everyday script was
                often used in documentary sources, in some mosaics and, in manuscripts, during
                slightly more informal situations such as writing a colophon. </p>

            <p xml:lang="en">This points to a more nuanced development of Syriac script. In
                manuscripts written between the fifth and seventh centuries, most S forms first
                appear in examples of a current hand often preserved in scribal colophons and other
                notes. Initially, however, there was not a unified style for this current hand;
                various letter forms first appear among surviving colophons and notes at different
                times. Some of these letter forms (for example a mim written in the shape of a
                reversed epsilon) never move to the main text of Syriac manuscripts. But others,
                what we call the S letters, later scribes adopted into a Syriac book hand albeit
                they adopted different letters at different times and in different combinations. In
                most cases this movement of an S form previously used only for a current hand into a
                book hand took place well before the 700s. Such a narrative differs substantially
                from the Standard Model depicted in text book script charts or in the often repeated
                claim that Serto first appeared in the eighth century. </p>

                Agree on How to Classify Manuscripts</p>
            <p xml:lang="en">Independent of its empirical accuracy, the Standard Model of Syriac
                script classification has a final, fatal flaw. If one looks at published script
                charts and text book descriptions, in theory it seems extremely clear cut what is
                Estrangela and what is Serto. But due to the difficulties of conforming the
                simplicity of this schema with the complexities of actual manuscript data, in
                practice scholars vary sharply in how they actually classify early manuscripts. To
                test the prevalence of such confusion, members of our team devised a survey of 33
                images from manuscript securely dated to before the twelfth century. We then ordered
                these randomly and sent them to five well-known specialists in Syriac Studies. Eight
                of the images came from manuscripts that contained only E letter forms. Six came
                from manuscripts that contained only S forms of variable letters. The remaining 21
                images came from manuscripts that illustrated some of the problems with the Standard
                Model, having either the E and S form of a particular letter, or a mixture of E
                forms of certain letters and S forms of other letters. For each manuscript image,
                the scholars were asked two questions: 1) “If you could only choose between Serto
                and Estrangela to define this manuscript, which would you choose? a) Serto or b)
                Estrangela”; and 2) “If a third category, Medial, is introduced, how do you now
                define the manuscript? a) Serto, b) Estrangela, c) Medial.” </p>
            <p xml:lang="en">
                <hi rend="italic">Figure</hi> 14 shows the results for the manuscripts
                that had either all E or all S letter forms. We initially considered these to be
                control images given their strong adherence to the Standard Model and expected
                consensus. In the case of the eight manuscripts with only E letter forms, all five
                scholars indeed did consistently categorize them as Estrangela. But quite
                unexpectedly, among the six manuscripts that had all S letters there was
                disagreement. One scholar consistently preferred to characterize all of these
                manuscripts with the intermediate category of Medial. Two other scholars, dissented
                from the majority in three additional cases. </p>
            <p xml:lang="en">As can be seen in <hi rend="italic">Figure</hi> 15, the results were
                much more divergent when it came to manuscripts with a combination of E and S forms.
                The bolded font represents minority opinions for each manuscript. Of these nineteen
                manuscripts, scholars could agree on their complete classification for only one of
                them. For the other eighteen, there was at least one out of the five scholars who
                dissented and, for most, there was a 3-2 split. This divide became especially
                pronounced when scholars were given the option of a third, intermediate category.
                Yet for seven of these manuscripts, there was disagreement over even the initial
                designation as either Estrangela or Serto. </p>
            <p xml:lang="en">There were few identifiable patterns for how the scholars classified
                manuscripts that contained both E and S letter forms; each had their own manner of
                identifying the script used. One scholar, for example, tended to categorize mixed E
                and S scripts as Estrangela and then Medial, while another often identified these
                manuscripts only as Estrangela. A closer look at the data reveals that the letter
                which most influenced these scholars’ decision on characterizing a manuscript as
                Serto was the presence of an S olaph. If a manuscript had an S olaph, 76% of the
                responses initially categorized it as Serto. Among the approximately one quarter of
                responses that dissented, two thirds of these switched from Estrangela to Medial
                when given the opportunity. So, at the end of the second question, 56% of the mixed
                E and S form manuscripts that had an S form olaph were identified as Medial, 36% as
                Serto, and only 8% as Estrangela irrespective of the other letters. The greatest
                influence on these scholars characterizing a manuscript with mixed E and S forms as
                Estrangela was the combination of an E olaph and an E taw. Of the 14 manuscripts
                that contained five S letter forms but had an E olaph and taw, 12 manuscripts were
                unanimously initially classified as Estrangela despite most of their variable
                letters having an S form. For the other two manuscripts with E olaph and taw but S
                forms of the other variable letters, four scholars initially classified them as
                Estrangela and one scholar as Serto. </p>
            <p xml:lang="en">Although from a small survey, the results are still rather shocking.
                Expanding the number of respondents would likely show even less consensus. Given the
                disconnect between the reigning model of Syriac script originally developed for
                printed text and actual script usage in early manuscripts, every scholar has
                essentially developed their own way to classify the manuscripts that they are
                reading. Most do this without recourse to any larger sample or to quantitative data
                resulting in a lack of scholarly consensus. If this small survey turns out to be
                even somewhat representative, it also suggests that when scholars classify the
                script of an early manuscript, they often do so by over relying on one or two letter
                forms at the expense of the majority of others. </p>
            <p xml:lang="en">• • •</p>
            <p xml:lang="en">The problem lies not in text book script charts, as long as one uses
                them only for printed texts or for relatively late manuscripts. But in the absence
                of a well-articulated classification schema for how Syriac script actually appears
                in early manuscripts, many have misapplied text book script charts to a medium for
                which they were not designed. As a result, a text book model has often become the
                Standard Model, an all-purpose schema that simply does not work for early materials.
                For early Syriac scribes often used E and S forms of one letter interchangeably.
                They often used E forms of some letters and S forms of others. In book hands, the
                various S letter forms first appear at different times usually long before the
                purported eighth-century birth of Serto and they most often appear in the current
                hand of manuscript notes even earlier. Researchers cannot agree on script
                identifications of early manuscripts, not even those manuscripts that generally fit
                this Standard Model.</p>
            <p xml:lang="en">Scholars such as Sebastian Brock, Ayda Kaplan, Andrew Palmer, and Lucas
                Van Rompay have proposed various alternatives to simply an Estrangela or Serto
                classification of early Syriac script.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn19" n="19">
                    <p rend="footnote text">Rompay, <hi rend="italic">Syriac Manuscripts of Deir-al
                            Surian</hi>, XXI-XXII; Palmer, “Syriac Letter Forms,” 68-89; Kaplan,
                        “Shape of the Letters,” 379-398; Kaplan, “La paléographie syriaque,”
                        307-319; Kaplan, “Syriac Paleography: The Development of a Method of

                        (Vth–Xth c.)”.</p>
                </note> Sometimes these models add additional
                qualifications such as “early” versus “late” Serto. Other times, an expansion of the
                Standard Model simply includes a third class such as “Medial” alongside Estrangela
                and Serto. In the case of Kaplan’s schema, there is a wholesale abandonment of the
                terms Estrangela and Serto and their replacement by the more nuanced categories of
                “monumental,” “monumental semi-cursive,” “cursive semi-monumental,” and “formal
                cursive.” </p>
            <p xml:lang="en">This article does not attempt to adjudicate between these approaches
                nor to present a new nomenclature. Rather, our goal has been simply to illustrate
                how desperately the Standard Model of Syriac script classification needs much more
                than just a little tweaking or a minor repair whenever one categorizes early Syriac
                manuscripts. We hope this will assist other scholars to develop a terminology and a
                history of Syriac script that much more accurately describe the ways early Syriac
                scribes actually wrote.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn20" n="20">

                        making our letter data set publically available. In about a year, scholars
                        should be able to create on-line customized, automatically generated charts
                        of both the main script of most early securely dated manuscripts as well as
                        the script of early securely dated notes. So, too, full page images from
                        most of these sources should be available. The interfaces will be linked to
                        the two main on-line resources for Syriac studies, syriac.org and syri.ac
                        and announced on the Hugoye list-serve.</p>

                    the left appears the script chart from Ruben Duval’s <hi rend="italic">Traite
                        Syriaque</hi> (1881) that divides Syriac into three exclusive scripts: later
                    “Nestorian,” and the two earlier scripts of Estrangela and Serto (what Duval
                    calls “Jacobite”). On the right is the script chart from Steven Hallam’s <hi rend="italic">Basic Classical Syriac</hi> (2016), that uses the terms
                    Estrangela, Eastern (instead of Duval’s “Nestorian”), and Western (instead of
                    Duval’s “Jacobite” or the more common “Serto”). Despite the 135-year difference
                    between when these script charts were published and their slightly different
                    terminology, their categorization of Syriac script remain essentially the same.
                    Almost all twentieth- and twenty-first-century Syriac script charts are
                    virtually identical to these two. The second chart is taken from <hi rend="italic">Basics of Classical Syriac</hi> by Steven C. Hallam. © 2016 by

                    have one olaph form, and in this case that form should have been S. But in

                    letters and S forms for others. In this case 46% of the 61 manuscripts securely
                    dated to the ninth and tenth centuries contain a mixture of E and S letters. </p>

                    securely dated appearances of the S form of he and a consistent S form of waw,
                    and mim. It also contains S forms of dolath, and rish. But the scribe still used

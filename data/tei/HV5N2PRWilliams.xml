         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P1"/>[1] These
    volumes are the first in a new series for which we can have
    high expectations and Gorgias Press is to be congratulated on
    the high quality of physical production of these books. They
    contain the fine text of the Old Syriac produced by George
    Kiraz and it is to be hoped that this publication will
    encourage further study of these important documents. To the
    texts supplied by Kiraz, the author has added fifty three pages
    of Introduction and Notes, a translation, and a number of
    footnotes.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P2"/>[2] It is
    argued in the Introduction and Notes at the beginning of the
    first volume, that the Old Syriac Gospels were not translated
    from our current Greek Gospels, but are original productions in
    Aramaic. The chief support for this is sought in the wording of
    Old Testament quotations found in the Old Syriac Gospels, which
    the author gives the impression of listing completely, though a
    number of important quotations are not considered (Matthew 3.3,
    9.13, Mark 1.2–3, 4.12). The author argues that
    similarities between the Old Syriac and the Masoretic Text must
    indicate direct dependence of the Old Syriac on the Masoretic
    Text. However, Wilson fails to consider the possibility that
    Old Syriac quotations have been influenced by the Old Testament
    Peshitta. He does not consider this because ‘The OT of
    P[eshitta] was clearly written later’ (p. xxxix). But
    this appeal to the self-evident runs counter to the
    overwhelming weight of published scholarship on the issue and
    the author offers no justification for his claim. Since his
    premise is baseless none of his conclusions need follow.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P3"/>[3]
    Unfortunately, Wilson has introduced some errors to the Syriac
    text he received from Kiraz. For instance Luke 15.13
    Curetonianus is missing the last word. I casually noted further
    in the Syriac texts of Matthew 3.10, 19.25, 21.31, 25.22, and
    Luke 15.13, though I made no systematic attempt to check his
    text.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P4"/>[4] The
    translation contains a number of different types of errors.</p>
         <p>(a) A large number of mistakes result simply from
    misreading Syriac letters. The following sample is merely
    illustrative. In Matthew 3.7 <hi rend="italic">’kdn’</hi> is
    mistranslated as ‘Perdition’ (i.e. reading
    <hi rend="italic">’bdn’</hi>); in Matthew 9.15
    <hi rend="italic">’bl’</hi> is mistranslated as
    ‘eating’ (i.e. reading <hi rend="italic">’kl’</hi>); in
    Luke 1.49 <hi rend="italic">mshb<hi rend="u">h</hi>
            </hi> is mistranslated
    as ‘capable’ (i.e. reading <hi rend="italic">mshk<hi rend="u">h</hi>
            </hi>). In both Luke 4.27 and 17.16 the word
    <hi rend="italic">grb</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">’</hi>
            <hi> </hi>‘leper’
    is taken to be <hi rend="italic">gbr</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">’</hi>
            <hi> </hi>‘man’. In Matthew 17.20 the
    translation ‘because <hi rend="italic">of the blindness of your</hi>
    faith’ seems wrongly to connect the first word in
    <hi rend="italic">z<hi rend="sup">c</hi>wrwt</hi> 
            <hi rend="italic">hymnwtkwn</hi> ‘your little
    faith’ with the root <hi rend="italic">
               <hi rend="sup">c</hi>wr</hi>
    ‘blind’. In Matthew 14.30, ‘take hold of
    me’ seems to misunderstand <hi rend="italic">’<hi rend="u">h</hi>ny</hi> as connected with the root
    <hi rend="italic">’<hi rend="u">h</hi>d</hi>. In Luke 14.32,
    ‘letters’ misreads <hi rend="italic">’yzgd’</hi>
            <hi> </hi>‘ambassador’ as
    <hi rend="italic">’grt’</hi>. In John 18.25 <hi rend="italic">sh<hi rend="u">h</hi>n</hi> ‘keeping warm’ is misread as the
    proper name ‘Hannan’. Often, unfortunately, the
    author’s failure to grasp the sense is not limited to
    mere misreading of individual words, but covers a whole
    construction. In Luke 3.3 (Sinaiticus) <hi rend="italic">bklh</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">’tr’ d<hi rend="u">h</hi>dry</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">ywrdnn</hi> is translated ‘and everywhere John
    went’ instead of ‘in all the region around the
    Jordan’. The author seems to have misread
    ‘Jordan’ as ‘John’ and construed the
    phrase to make sense round that supposition. In Luke 9.57
    (Sinaiticus) <hi rend="italic">wkd</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">’zlyn b’wr<hi rend="u">h</hi>’ ’mr lh ’nsh ’t’
    btrk l’tr d’zl ’nt</hi>  should be
    understood as ‘And when they were going on the road, a
    man said to him, “I will come after you to wherever you
    go”’. Wilson, however, reads ‘And when they
    were going on the road a man said to them, Come with me to a
    place where I will go.’ This misreads <hi rend="italic">lh</hi> ‘to
    him’ as ‘to them’, and systematically
    confuses second and first person. Wilson then notes that
    Curetonianus reads the same, when it is actually rather
    different. It has <hi rend="italic">wkd</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">’zlyn
    b’wr<hi rend="u">h</hi>’ ’t’
    gbr’ <hi rend="u">h</hi>d ’mr lh
    ’t’ btrk l’tr d’zl ’nt</hi>, which
    means ‘And when they were going on the road, <hi rend="italic">a certain
    man came</hi> (and) said to him, etc.’</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P5"/>[5]
    Sometimes the sense of a word is completely mistaken. In Mark
    11.16 he translates <hi rend="italic">bgw</hi> ‘inside’ as
    ‘outside’, and in Mark 14.68 <hi rend="italic">npq</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">ldrt’ bryt’</hi> ‘he went out to the outer
    court’ is understood as ‘he went out of the
    courtyard into the country’. In John 18.3 (Sinaiticus)
    <hi rend="italic">knsh</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">’ d<hi rend="sup">c</hi>m’</hi>  ‘a
    crowd of people’ is understood as ‘the crowd with
    him’.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P6"/>[6] There
    are also some problems with numbers. In Mark 14.61
    <hi rend="italic">dtrtyn</hi> 
            <hi rend="italic">zbnyn</hi> ‘a second time’ is
    understood as ‘three times’ (no doubt helped by the
    fact that the Syriac number bears some resemblance to English
    ‘three’), and in Luke 24.13, where Emmaus is said
    to be ‘sixty stadia’ from Jerusalem, Wilson
    translates ‘sixty’ as ‘two’. One
    suspects here some confusion with the Hebrew feminine word for
    ‘two’ which looks similar to the Syriac word for
    ‘sixty’. Wilson then compounds the mistake by
    adding a footnote saying that the distance was ‘about 1/4
    of a mile’. One thus has to envisage the whole Emmaus
    road conversation taking place over a rather short
    distance.</p>
         <p>Some mistakes show a lack of appreciation of basic
    points of grammar. Wilson’s translation for Luke 22.22
    Sinaiticus (and not dissimilarly for Curetonianus) reads
    ‘And the Son of man goes, as was decreed on high, but woe
    to him by whose hand he is betrayed’. The words
    translated ‘on high, but’ are <hi rend="italic">brm</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">dyn</hi>, a pair frequently used as a strong adversative.
    Even if Wilson’s translation of <hi rend="italic">brm</hi> had been
    possible, <hi rend="italic">dyn</hi> does not take the first position in a
    clause.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P7"/>[7] (b) In a
    few places the vagaries of poor translation make rather odd
    reading: ‘While they were sitting they wrote some
    nonsense (and) put it over his head’ (Matthew 27.37 in
    Sinaiticus, though it is better translated in the parallel in
    Mark 15.26), ‘if you had the faith of a grain of
    mustard’ (Luke 17.6); ‘Father, if you <hi rend="italic">can</hi>,
    take this cup from me’ (Luke 22.42 in Curetonianus,
    mistaking a feminine participle as referring to God);
    ‘The Lord truly stood and appeared to Simon’ (Luke
    24.34, taking <hi rend="italic">qm</hi> as ‘stood’ rather than
    ‘arose’, despite the surrounding resurrection
    context); ‘But he was something that was’ (John 1.3
    in Curetonianus); ‘but you seek to kill me because my
    word proceeds into you’ (Jesus speaking in John 8.37 in
    Sinaiticus, a problem partly caused by the omission of a
    negative); ‘I rejoice for your sakes that you may believe
    that I was not there’ (John 11.15 in Sinaiticus).</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P8"/>[8] (c)
    There are at least forty omissions, including Mark 6.56 where
    twelve words are left untranslated.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P9"/>[9] (d) The
    translation is quite irregular. Important details are ignored,
    and unimportant ones are made a centre of focus. Thus in Luke
    19.13 and throughout the parable that follows, the word
    ‘mina’ is translated ‘talent’.
    Meanwhile the author carefully distinguishes whether Sinaiticus
    or Curetonianus have <hi rend="italic">dyn</hi> ‘now’ or <hi rend="italic">w</hi>
    ‘and’ at the beginning of a verse (Luke 20.5).</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P10"/>[10] (e)
    As well as the mistakes in translation there are also many
    typos, some of the more heinous sort: p.
    ‘hermaneutics’ (p. xvii), ‘emporer’ (p.
    xxi), ‘the forth century’ (p. xxiv),
    ‘site’ for ‘cite’ (p. lviii),
    ‘council’ for ‘counsel’ (p. 98),
    ‘Hale, king of the Jews!’ (p. 372). Some words are
    consistently misused: ‘rather then’ for
    ‘rather than’ (p. lx) and ‘more then’
    for ‘more than’ (p. 552), ‘it’s’
    as a possessive (pp. 58 and 290), ‘greated him’ for
    ‘greeted him’ (p. 456, twice). Sometimes the author
    does not write in proper sentences, and commas are often used
    to join sentences. The author also misspells words in German,
    Greek, Hebrew, and Syriac.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P11"/>[11] The
    footnotes do not fare much better than the translation. They
    are usually banal, and very often incorrect. For instance, on
    p. 330 a five line footnote considers the implications of the
    fact that whereas the Greek has a feminine, the Syriac
    ‘is clearly masculin’ [sic]. Yet it is
    feminine!</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P12"/>[12]
    Despite the cataloguing of error necessary to make readers
    aware of the deficiencies of the work, the news is not all bad.
    The method used to produce these books means that print runs
    are small and corrections can easily be introduced. Although
    the volumes would need an enormous amount of work to make the
    translations reliable, there is still a niche in the market for
    a good English translation of the Old Syriac Gospels. The
    author should therefore rise to the challenge of acquiring the
    proper knowledge of the language(s) and of meticulously
    revising these translations for a future edition.</p>

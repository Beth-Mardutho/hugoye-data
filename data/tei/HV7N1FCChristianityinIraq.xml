    department for the Study of Religions, School of Oriental and
    African Studies, University of London in conjunction with The
    British School of Archaeology in Iraq and The Anglican and
    Eastern Churches Association is organizing a seminar on
    "Christianity in Iraq" investigating the Christian heritage of
    Iraq on Saturday, April 3, 2004 at The Brunei Gallery Lecture
    Theatre, Thornhaugh St., Russell Square, London, WC1H 0XG.</p>
         <head>Christianity in Iraq: Synopsis</head>
         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P2"/>[2] The
    origins of Christianity in Iraq are shrouded in the mists of
    time, but groups of Christians were settled by the second
    century C.E. During the Sassanid period (241 - 632 C.E.) the
    'Church of the East' and the 'Syrian Orthodox Churches' emerged
    as distinct entities. Christians contributed to the
    intellectual environment of Islam, particularly during the
    Abbassid period. At this time the dioceses of the Church of the
    East extended to the Gulf and Arabia and as far as China. In
    Central Asia, conversions were made amongst the Kerait and
    other Altaic tribes.</p>
         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P3"/>[3] When
    Hulugu Khan led his forces into Iraq in the thirteenth century,
    Christian princesses were counted amongst the members of the
    Mongol royal family. The vigour of Christianity under the
    Il-Khanate is epitomised by the writings of Gregory Bar
    Hebraeus. A century later, the arrival of Tamerlane ushered in
    a period of terror and instability for Christianity. Many
    communities fled northward to the Mosul plain and the Hakkari
    region of Turkey where they remained until the 1920's.</p>
         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P4"/>[4] The
    seventeenth and eighteenth centuries saw the arrival of
    Europeans and increased contact with the Christian communities
    of Iraq. Roman Catholic missionaries brought elements of the
    'Church of the East' and the 'Syrian Orthodox Church' under the
    aegis of Rome, as Uniate churches. Today the the 'Chaldaean'
    church is the largest Christian denomination in Iraq. But the
    rich fabric of Christianity still includes adherants of the
    traditional Syriac churches, as well as relative newcomers
    including the Protestant churches.</p>

         <head>Morning Session: History and Archaeology</head>
         <p>[10.00 A.M. - 12.30 P.M.]</p>
         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P5"/>[5] The
    morning session will consist of a series of papers exploring
    aspects of the history and archaeology of Christianity in Iraq
    down the centuries. Speakers include:</p>

         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P6"/>[6] The
    afternoon session will investigate the modern presence of
    Christianity in Iraq. Representatives of the various Syriac
    Churches [including the Assyrians, Chaldaeans, Syrian Orthodox]
    will profile the current situations of their communities.</p>
         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P7"/>[7]
    <hi rend="bold">Prof. Geoffrey Khan FBA</hi> (Cambridge) will
    conclude the day with a talk about his AHRB-funded project that
    is mapping the Neo-Syriac dialects that are still spoken today
    by the Christian communities in northern Iraq as well as in the
    diaspora.</p>

                <p xml:lang="en">Andreas Juckel has shown that MS Vat. Sir. 268 is the best witness
                    to the Harklean text of the Gospels, since its text is less “byzantinized” than the
                    other manuscripts. However, the complexity of the particular features of the
                    Harklean version (variant readings in the margin and “critical signs” in the text)
                    and their transmission history elude easy and conclusive solutions. This paper
                    illustrates that the process of “Byzantinization” of the Harklean text was not a
                    unilateral development, but rather a complex and multidimensional transformation
                    that still needs more research, as even late Harklean manuscripts may preserve
                    ancient and original readings. MS Chaldean 25 of Alqosh, which lays at the dawn of
                    the new revision of the Harklean version by Dionysios bar Salibi in the twelfth
                    century, is helpful in tracing the process of these textual transformations.</p>

                Harkel, created at the monastery of Enaton near Alexandria at the beginning of the
                seventh century, still conceals many mysteries for NT scholarship. The Harklean
                version was most likely intended from the beginning to be a type of “scholarly

                has been widely acknowledged by scholars. The question, however, of the best witness
                to the Harklean text has remained open, because more than one hundred Harklean
                manuscripts survive but even the oldest among them have their flaws.<note

                        manuscripts in total. Among these more or less 60 contain the
                    gospels.</p></note> Moreover, a revisional development, likely deliberate, led
                to a progressive accommodation of this Syriac translation towards the Byzantine
                text-type. The Greek text of the Gospels was itself in a state of development and
                gradually influenced scribes who copied Harklean manuscripts. As a result, both of
                the typical Harklean features, namely critical signs in the text (<hi rend="italic"
                    >asteriskoi</hi> and <hi rend="italic">obeloi</hi>) and variant readings in the
                margin, often differ among the manuscripts. The consistency of the transmission of
                these features over time (or its absence) may argue for the quality of the
                manuscripts and reveal stages of the Harklean tradition. </p>

                        Juckel proposed different date ranges for this manuscript in 2017:
                        tenth–thirteenth cent. (A. Juckel,

                        (A. Juckel, “Review of: Samer S.

                        209). MS C25 was, however, not mentioned by Juckel among the best Harklean
                        witnesses (A. Juckel, “Die

                        Scher (and Thomas after him) previously dated MS C to the thirteenth cent.
                        (A. Scher, “Notice sur les

                critiqued by Juckel, who argued that MS C25 “reflects a pre-history of the
                revisional stage” and, thus, presents a text which belongs to an intermediate stage

                17124 (1233/34 CE.) [=BL17124] and called by him the “Dionysios bar Salibi stage”
                (twelfth century).<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn8" n="8"><p rend="footnote text">

                        xxxvii–xxxix.</p></note> This last “Dionysios-stage” still needs, however,
                more research, first of all in a more precise description of the textual resemblance
                of these two manuscripts. For this very reason, MS C25 is worth much more scholarly
                attention. This manuscript preserves a wealth of Harklean features and stands
                in-between the two extremes of the Harklean tradition (the “original” stage and
                “Dionysios-stage”), thus providing unique insights about transformations in
                development between them and revealing a more balanced view on the process of the
                “Byzantinization” of the Harklean tradition.</p>
            <p xml:lang="en">MS C25 will be compared in this paper with MS V268. The best test-field in this
                regard is the Gospel of Luke, which has served as the basis for previous studies by
                    Juckel.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn9" n="9"><p rend="footnote text"> Juckel’s
                        research on the Harklean Gospel of Luke has appeared mainly in three papers:
                        A. Juckel, “Zur
                        Revisionsgeschichte der Harklensis”, in
                        <hi rend="italic">Bericht der Hermann Kunst-Stiftung zur Förderung der Neutestamentichen Textforschung für die Jahre 1992 bis 1994 </hi>(Münster
                        – Westfalen: 1995) 50–68; A.
                        Juckel, “Ms Vat. Syr. 268 and the Revisional Development of the Harklean
                        Margin” (<hi rend="italic">Hugoye</hi> 1:1 [1998]) 19–33;
                        Juckel, “Die Bedeutung,” 22–45
                        (this is a more developed version of the previous one).</p></note> The
                comparison of these two manuscripts is undertaken in three steps: analysis of the
                process of Graecization of the proper names (see 2), analysis of the Harklean margin
                (see 3), and analysis of the critical signs in the Harklean lemma (see 4). Then,
                these results are further compared with the manuscripts believed to be witnesses of
                the “Dionysios-stage” in order to determine how far or far close is MS C25 related
                to that stage. All of this will finally allow to evaluate MS C25’s relevance for the
                study of the Harklean Gospels.</p>

                    signs in MS V286 and MS C25 are analyzed. Also, for the marginal readings, these
                    results are compared separately with those reached by Juckel (see 3.2). </p>

                            lectionaries with mixed Peshitta and Harklean readings), but its

                <p xml:lang="en">Juckel has applied terms “Byzantine” and “non-Byzantine” as rather broad labels.
                    First, it is crucial to recall the basic difference between a “Byzantine”
                    [=Byz.] and a “Majority” text/reading [=𝔐].<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn17"
                        n="17"><p rend="footnote text"> “Majority Text” is a purely quantitative
                            category, while “Byzantine Text” is an historical (and text-critical)
                            category. Thus, it would be misleading to call all Majority readings
                            “Byzantine,” or all Byzantine readings “Majority”. <hi rend="italic"
                                >Textus Receptus</hi> [=TR] is yet another category, which refers to
                            the standard edition of the Byzantine text, first by Erasmus. Other
                            editions followed this standard text until the 19th cent. See

                    and “non-Byzantine” opposition is followed, especially in the presentation of
                    Juckel’s results, but on the other hand, whenever needed, a more detailed list
                    of witnesses is provided. This is significant, above all, in regard to several
                    rare readings which, although they are Byzantine (or even Majority), may also be
                    attested by ancient witnesses.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn18" n="18"><p

                            K. Wachtel, “Notes on the

                            2017): “If the bias against the text of the majority of all witnesses
                            has been overcome, then the variants transmitted by the majority will
                            appear in a different light, even if some early witnesses read
                            differently. It can then be considered with due impartiality whether or
                            not a majority reading does in fact follow the tendency towards the
                            fuller, easier, more smooth variant. There can be no doubt that this
                            tendency exists, but it applies to the transmission on the whole, not
                            only with scribes of younger manuscripts. It is true that variants of
                            this kind accumulated in the majority text, but in more than a few cases
                            the more difficult variant is in the majority text. Moreover, the
                            editorial team of the ECM sees a strong external criterion in favor of
                            the majority reading where a variant with A-related attestation is
                            confirmed by the majority, because this points to a continuous
                            transmission since the early period.”</p></note> For very rare readings
                    full evidence is given. In other cases, in order not to clutter the footnotes,
                    only a limited list is provided (often more Byzantine witnesses are omitted).
                    The evidence presented should be sufficient to allow the readers to make their
                    own judgment. Obviously, this paper focuses on a wide panorama of the
                    manuscripts, but for a more specific text-critical evaluation of each variant, a
                    detailed study should be made.</p>

                <p rend="H Paragraph First">One of the major fields where the ongoing process of the
                    Byzantinization may be noticed is the way of spelling in Syriac of proper names
                    which gradually tend to be less Semitic and more Greek. In this field the
                    transformation may be easily studied. Juckel already proved this revisional
                    development among the Harklean manuscripts. Now, the data from MS C25 may be
                    added to those results. The “Dionysios-stage” (represented here by MS BL 17124)
                    was an intermediate one, with many Semitic spellings still evident. A full
                    accommodation to the Greek spelling was reached later in the MS NC333. The most
                    extensive among Juckel’s examples comes from the first part of Jesus’s genealogy
                    according to Luke (3:23–30).<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn19" n="19"><p

                    between MSS V268 and C25 will be the comparison of their marginal variant notes.
                    Variant notes in the margin stand among typical Harklean features, but the
                    inconsistencies in their transmission may show particular choices being made
                    between particular manuscripts in question. The first part of this section
                    presents a general comparison of the Harklean margin in both manuscripts (3.1).
                    The second part compares MS C25 with Juckel’s results (3.2). This study does not
                    include Greek and Syriac spelling notes appearing in the margin, because they do
                    not present real variants to the lemma. </p>

                        readings unique to MS V268 (3.1.1), then to MS C25 (3.1.2) and, last, cases

                        <p rend="H Paragraph First">There are numerous marginal readings which
                            appear only in MS V268. This means that in MS C25 these readings were
                            either inserted into the lemma or suppressed. But it is hard to notice
                            among the entirety of these cases any consistent revisional development
                            towards the Byzantine text-type. Nine times these marginal readings that
                            appear in MS V268 and were inserted into the lemma of MS C25 are
                            traceable to (mostly rare) Greek variants, earlier Syriac renderings or
                            variants of another origin.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn28" n="28"><p

                        <p rend="H Paragraph First">MS C25 offers numerous unique readings in the
                            margin, but many of them are only spelling variants (mostly names),
                            which witness to a later development of the Harklean margin (see 2. <hi
                                rend="italic">Graecization of Proper Names</hi>). Still, there are
                            more “new” marginal notes and they do not seem to be the result of a
                            unilateral revision. Many of them do not appear in other
                                manuscripts.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn33" n="33"><p

                                    thoroughly though. Juckel’s “Liste I,3” presents only a
                                    selection of these “new” marginalia in the other manuscripts.
                                    See Juckel, “Die
                                    Bedeutung,” 40–41. See below for a comparison with later
                                    manuscripts, connected to the so-called “Dionysios
                                stage.”</p></note> They were either newly created by the later
                            revisers, or they preserve some layer of a precedent Harklean tradition
                            which is not extant in MS V268. </p>

                        <p xml:lang="en">A closer look at the later manuscripts helps in determining some
                            patterns. MS BF362 is a very faithful copy of MS C25. Only in four of
                            thirty-one cases does MS BF362 exchange the margin with the lemma. MSS
                            NC334 and BL17124 appear not only to be almost identical but they are
                            also close relatives to MS C25. Numerous “new” marginalia in MS C25 are
                            repeated also in MSS NC334 and BL17124. MS NC333 is different in this
                            regard. It omits most of these “new” marginalia. Sometimes it inserts
                            them into the lemma or exhibits mixed solutions. All four manuscripts
                            (MSS BF362, NC333, NC334 and BL17124) show signs of a further
                            redactional activity in comparison with MS C25. For example, in cases
                            like 1:74 (NC333, BL17124), 4:32 (NC333), 6:35 (NC333), 12:2 (NC333),
                            12:16 (BF362, NC334, BL17124), 12:56 (BF362, NC333, BL17124), 13:32
                            (NC333, BL17124), 14:22 (NC333), 17:4 (NC333, BL17124), 18:25 (NC333),
                            20:19 (NC333), 21:23 (NC333), 22:63 (NC334, BL17124), “new” readings
                            most probably appeared first in the margin of MS C25 (or another
                            connected tradition) and later were inserted into the lemma of other
                            manuscripts, while corresponding readings were either moved from the
                            lemma into the margin or suppressed. This is seen most often in MS
                            NC333. Four times (10:41; 12:2; 18:25; 21:23) the “new” readings, that
                            appeared in the margin of MS C25 (probably earlier) and in the margin of
                            MSS BF362, NC334 and BL17124 (probably later), and were created by
                            moving to the margin the readings of MS V268, are now “corrected” in MS
                            NC333: the lemma is reverted to MS V268 and the “new” lemma is moved to
                            the margin. This proves that MS NC333 is most likely a witness to a sort
                            of “correction” of the “Dionysios-stage” stage in the direction of the
                            most ancient Harklean tradition (=MS V268). All of this data shows also
                            that MS C25 certainly represents a connected but earlier stage of the
                            tradition than the others. In the following table all the evidence for
                            these “new” marginalia in MS C25 is now listed together and compared
                            with other manuscripts.</p>

                        <head>3.1.3. Lemma and Margin Exchanged between MS V268 and MS C25</head>
                        <p rend="H Paragraph First">The reader can often observe how the lemma and
                            the margin are exchanged between these two manuscripts in question.
                            These cases show the particular choices being taken during the
                            transmission of the Harklean tradition. However, it is difficult to
                            describe any consistency in these choices. Fifteen times MS C25 prefers
                            readings which agree with the well-attested, older tradition against the
                            Majority readings (extant in the MS V268).<note place="foot"

                        <p xml:lang="en">Once more a broader look on the other manuscripts helps in evaluating how
                            the Harklean tradition developed. The choices of MS C25 are almost
                            always copied in MS BF362 and very often also in MSS NC334 and BL17124.
                            These last two are sometimes uniform in very unique variants (see for
                            example 16:9), but it does not mean that they are totally identical. One
                            can see a further revisional activity in MS BL17124, as some marginal
                            readings are totally suppressed, while the lemma remains as in MS C25
                            (4:22; 6:17; 10:39; 11:50; 13:3; 16:29; 17:26; 19:9; 19:30; 24:7). Only
                            in two of these cases is MS NC334 identical BL17124 (19:9; 24:7). Here,
                            also MS NC333 is often close to MS V268. Thirty-two out of forty-two
                            times MS NC333 is identical in both lemma and margin to MS V268. In the
                            following table all the mentioned cases of exchange between lemma and
                            margin in MSS V268 and C25 are listed together and compared with other

                                    dominant Byzantine text (majority text). This is especially true
                                    with regard to the revisional alteration of the apparatus in the
                                    early Harklean manuscripts. For a great number of these
                                    alterations are promoting the Byzantine text by removing the
                                    non-Byzantine reading of the textline to the margin or even by

                            this transformation was a secondary development in the Harklean
                            tradition, these readings prove that much care is needed to judge them

                                    reflection of an early Greek reading may signal a secondary
                                    accretion and cannot be taken as an indicator to the initial

                            observed in various manuscripts and, apparently, was due not just to
                            casual omissions by the copyists but also to revisional activity: when a
                            non-Byzantine marginal variant had no support in the contemporary Greek
                            tradition, it was removed.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn59" n="59"><p

                            Such transformations prove that MS V268 preserves an earlier stage of
                            the Harklean text than the other manuscripts. MS C25 is special in this
                            regard. In 13 out of 15 of these places MS C25’s lemma is identical to

                    signs among the manuscripts, as in the case of the marginal readings, may point
                    to a revisional activity in the later stages of the tradition. In the later
                    manuscripts some signs disappear, others are new. What kind of readings do they
                    mark? Was their appearance/ disappearance a one-way transformation in the
                    direction of the Byzantine text-type? The following analysis tries to trace any
                    possible pattern in this regard. The analysis makes use of a general division
                    employed by Juckel in his paper (Byzantine and non-Byzantine) but includes also
                    the big picture of all the

                <head>5. Summary</head>
                <p rend="H Paragraph First">1. Before Yohanna’s edition MS C25 has never been
                    included in the research of the Harklean text of the Gospels. As MS C25 exhibits
                    the richness of the typical Harklean features (variants in the margin and
                    critical signs in the text), its inclusion becomes very profitable for the
                    Harklean research. Thanks to the high material quality of MS C25, numerous
                    marginal notes which are poorly visible in MS V268 due to its damage can now be
                    further confirmed. </p>
                <p xml:lang="en">2. A comparison with Juckel’s results (see 3.2.2. and 3.2.3.) proved that MS C25
                    was less subjected to the ongoing “Byzantinization” than the other manuscripts
                    examined by him. The detailed study of divergences between MSS V268 and C25 has
                    revealed that the process of the “Byzantinization” of the Harklean version was
                    not a unilateral process, but rather a complex and multidimensional
                    transformation. MS C25 shows transformations not only in the direction of a
                    further “Byzantinization” of the Harklean text, but also in the opposite
                    direction, which might have been an attempt to clear this translation of the
                    Byzantine elements and return to better and older traditions. Sometimes older
                    Syriac renderings are once more employed. This paper has shown that there are no
                    really overwhelming patterns among these textual choices. Moreover, several
                    readings which belong to the Majority Text are attested by the ancient tradition
                    as well. Care is needed when using these cases as an argument for the process of
                    the “Byzantinization” of the Harklean text. The later revisers might have used
                    different sources which still preserved these ancient readings. </p>
                <p xml:lang="en">3. For these reasons, any description of the nature of these developments among
                    the Harklean manuscripts must avoid broad generalizations and judgments on the
                    intention and the workflow of the copyists (or revisers), as these processes are
                    extremely difficult to trace. Moreover, the wide variety of readings of diverse
                    origins, attested in the long history of the Harklean version and witnessed here
                    by the lemma and margin of MS C25, may point not only to a deliberate process of
                    revisions but also to signs of confusion in the succeeding stages of the
                    tradition. Perhaps later scribes tried to show more variants that were available
                    to them in the Harklean (and eventual Greek?) manuscripts and inserted them,
                    sometimes into the margin, sometimes into the text. Numerous readings presented
                    in this paper deserve a full treatment on their own. </p>
                <p xml:lang="en">4. The Harklean version during its transmission history was subject to more
                    revisions. The most important was probably connected with the person of
                    Dionysios bar Salibi (d. 1171). However, we do not know in what actually
                    consisted his re-working of the Harklean version. Was it a real and proper
                    revision or only an accommodation of some readings? More research is needed in
                    order to reach final conclusions in this matter. However, with the inclusion of
                    MS C25, we can trace now more sub-stages of this particular moment of the
                    Harklean tradition. Several marginal readings appeared first in MS C25’s margin,
                    and only later were inserted into the lemma of MSS NC334 and BL17124 (and less
                    frequently NC333, only rarely in BF362). Should this particular moment be called
                    the “pre-history” of the “Dionysios-stage” or is MS C25 rather its best and
                    undistorted witness? On the one hand, the MS C25 lemma and margin already
                    reflect clear signs of the revision. Although MS C25 is close to MSS NC334 and
                    BL17124, it is however much more consistent in its textual choices than the two
                    others. On the other hand, MS C25 lacks some features considered to be
                    particular hallmarks of Dionysios’s revision: MS C25 does not omit the Greek
                    marginalia nor most of the <hi rend="italic">asteriskoi</hi> and <hi
                        rend="italic">obeloi</hi> (as MSS NC334 and BL17124 do) and lacks the <hi
                        rend="italic">Pericope Adulterae</hi> in the Gospel of John (7:53–8:11).
                    Also, a closer study of some readings reveals that MSS BF362, NC334 and BL17124
                    are secondary to MS C25 (for example, an Old Syriac variant <foreign xml:lang="syr">ܕܚܝܒ</foreign> in Luke 11:4 probably first
                    appeared in the margin of MS C25, and later it was inserted into the lemma of
                    BF362 and NC334). If these features really belonged to the “Dionysios-stage”,
                    Juckel’s intuition has been confirmed: MS C25 belongs to a “pre-history” of the
                    Harklean version. But if these features are actually a further development of
                    the Harklean tradition, maybe MS C25 is really the best witness to the
                    “Dionysios-stage.” If the second is true, the dating of MS C25 must be postponed
                    even to the twelfth century. In order to solve this question in a satisfactory
                    way still more research is needed. </p>
                <p xml:lang="en">5. Also other late Harklean manuscripts may now be better understood. MS BF362
                    appears as a close but not an exact copy of MS C25. Its script is very similar
                    (but in two columns), as is the content of its lemma and margin. Sometimes,
                    however, MS BF362 switches the lemma and the margin or takes particular choices,
                    for example, the inclusion of the <hi rend="italic">Pericope Adulterae</hi>
                    (John 7:53–8:11). Yet another revision of the Harklean version is reflected in
                    the state of the text preserved in MS NC333. Its relationship to the early stage
                    of MS V268 is now further confirmed. However, MS NC333 depended also in some way
                    on the tradition preserved in MS C25. In MS NC333 the lemma is sometimes
                    reverted to MS V268 and the “new” lemma of “Dionysios-stage” is moved to the
                    margin, numerous “new” <hi rend="italic">asteriskoi</hi> of MS C25 appear in MS
                    NC333 as well, but proper names in MS NC333 present already highly Graecized
                    spellings. All of this shows that MS NC333 is probably the fruit of a
                    “correction” in the direction of MS V268, which the “Dionysios-stage” text
                    underwent later.</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">6. All of this proves, once again, that further studies on the Harklean text of
                    the Gospels are needed. The production of critical editions of the Harklean
                    version appears as a primary necessity. Their publication will make possible a
                    careful analysis of particular cases, and then wider research on the nature of
                    this translation and of the particular manuscripts. Perhaps future editions of
                    the Greek New Testament should also include the variety of Harklean readings
                    that further confirm the lemma or indicate new Greek variants.</p>

                <head>6. Conclusion</head>
                <p rend="H Normal First">The panorama of the transmission history of the Harklean
                    version is very complex. The research of Andreas Juckel over the years has shown
                    the precedence of the V268 manuscript for profitable studies of the Harklean
                    text. Samer Yohanna’s edition of the Harklean version of Mark using MS C25 of
                    Alqosh as the base text has given this manuscript a wider scholarly audience so
                    that future studies can access this important witness to the Harklean text.
                    While, in general, MS C25 does not offer a better text than MS V268, this paper
                    shows that its inclusion among the Harklean witnesses may be useful in tracing
                    the particular development of this version. MS C25 stands at the dawn of the
                    late revision of the Harklean version and, as such, allows for a better
                    explanation of the formation of that revision and its connections with the
                    previous stages of the tradition.</p>

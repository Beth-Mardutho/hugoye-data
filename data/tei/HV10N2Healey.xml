            <p>This paper reviews the cultural and
    linguistic environment in which the Syriac dialect of Aramaic
    emerged as a language of inscriptions, legal documents and, in
    due course, literature. It is argued that the evidence for the
    hellenization of the Edessa region in the Greek and early Roman
    periods is slight. Edessa owed more to its Semitic cultural
    roots and early Syriac writings do not reflect strong Greek
    impact. The emergence of the language is to be seen in the
    context of the varied contemporary Aramaic dialects of
    Mesopotamia, with the variations also reflected within early
    Syriac itself.</p>

            <anchor corresp="P1"/>[1]
    Syriac’s emergence as a literary language was stimulated
    on the one hand by a multicultural Semitic, Greek and Iranian
    environment, and on the other by the demands made of the
    language in the context of the spread of Christianity. In some
    sense Syriac <hi rend="italic">responded</hi> to these demands. Of course, we
    often talk about languages in a metaphorical way, as if a
    language were able to decide whether to respond or not! In some
    sense languages have a life of their own and this partly
    explains why, in our attempts to describe their processes, we
    tend to use terms derived from the life sciences, such as the
    terms “family” and “birth”.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P2"/>[2] In
    attempting to describe the cultural and linguistic environment
    of the birth of Syriac, we look primarily to the earliest
    evidence, the archaeological evidence and the earliest written
    materials in the language, which are labelled
    “Syriac” or, more specifically, “Old
    Syriac”. These inscriptions and legal texts come from a
    particular and narrowly defined locality, the kingdom of
    Edessa, centred on Urhay, the modern-day Urfa in southern
    Turkey. The number of the Old Syriac inscriptions has now
    reached about 110 and we have in addition the immensely
    important treasure of three long Syriac legal texts on
    parchment. Many of these inscriptions and parchments are dated
    either directly or indirectly and the dates span the period
    from A.D. 6 to A.D. 243 (Drijvers and Healey 1999, used for
    reference to inscriptions below). All of these materials are
    non-Christian, and there is no expression of Christian
    sentiments or allegiance in them. The cultural environment of
    this early Syriac is, therefore, pagan. The Syriac of the texts
    is usually classified as “Middle Aramaic”, a term
    which also covers other contemporary Aramaic dialects such as
    Palmyrene and Nabataean.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P3"/>[3] So where
    did Syriac come from? And what was the environment of its
    transformation into a major literary and theological language?
    I address these questions under three headings: I. The cultural
    hellenization of pre-Christian Edessa; II. The impact of the
    Greek language on Edessa and on pre-Christian Syriac; and,
    rather briefly, since the details are covered elsewhere, III.
    Early Syriac in the context of contemporary Aramaic. I will
    then comment on some specific factors which contributed to the
    rise of what is usually called classical Syriac.</p>
         <head xml:id="HV10N2Healey3">I. The Cultural Hellenization of Pre-Christian
    Edessa</head>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P4"/>[4] Although
    this area of Upper Mesopotamia was from time immemorial one of
    Semitic language use, it is also in the Greek and Roman periods
    an environment of considerable international contact and
    specifically of contact on the one hand with Parthia (and
    subsequently Sasanian Persia) and on the other with the
    Greek-speaking Seleucid Kingdom and Roman East.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P5"/>[5] How far
    we can regard the Edessa region as hellenized in the
    pre-Christian period, has, however, been disputed and indeed
    subject to some fluctuations of scholarly fashion. Robert
    Murray in a publication of 1982 (1982: 9-10) noted the view,
    widely accepted in the early twentieth century, that
    Edessa’s culture was non-hellenic and
    “purely” Semitic. Murray committed himself to a
    retraction from this position in favour of the view that Edessa
    was extensively if not thoroughly hellenized in pre-Christian
    times. This view was even more strongly espoused by my late and
    much loved friend Han Drijvers (e.g. 1970, 1998). I believe,
    however, that some retraction from the retraction is necessary,
    since there is a danger of exaggeration of the hellenistic
    factor in early Edessa.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P6"/>[6] There is
    no doubt, it must be stated from the start, that
    multiculturalism is woven into the fabric of the early history
    of Edessa. It was, after all, essentially a Seleucid foundation
    and became a provincial centre within the Seleucid Kingdom,
    with a Macedonian name, Seleucid-Hellenistic institutions and,
    no doubt, physical appearance. Seleucid coins, for example,
    were struck. At the same time, however, it must be remembered
    that the new foundation was located at the site of an older
    city, Adme (Harrak 1992). We know very little about this
    earlier Adme, but the whole region of Upper Mesopotamia
    <hi rend="italic">is</hi> well known in earlier times. Edessa’s
    neighbour, Harran, had been a prominent cultural centre for
    millennia and housed a famous temple of the moon-god, Sin,
    whose cult continued into the early centuries A.D., as the
    Syriac inscriptions from Sumatar Harabesi show.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P7"/>[7] With the
    decline of Seleucid power and a little before the Romans
    arrived, Edessa grasped its chance to establish itself as an
    independent state with its own kings of a local dynasty, said
    to be that of Aryu, around 140-30 B.C. It is often called the
    Abgarid dynasty because of the prominence of the royal name
    Abgar. Segal (1970: 16) claimed that this was a Nabataean
    dynasty. This seems implausible: the only real evidence is the
    names of kings, such as Abgar, Ma‘nu, etc. These conform
    to a name-type, common in Nabataea, but common also throughout
    the Middle East in this period and they may suggest that in
    Edessa, as in Petra, there was already an Arab presence. It is
    possible that an Arab dynasty came to power by filling the
    post-Seleucid power-vacuum. There is nothing, however, to
    suggest a specifically Nabataean presence.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P8"/>[8] It is
    interesting to note that, in contrast to the policy of the
    Nabataean kings, so far as we know <hi rend="italic">local</hi> coins were not
    issued in Edessa until much later, the middle of the
    2<hi rend="sup">nd</hi> century A.D. There was no early
    “native” imitation of Seleucid coinage. And when
    coins <hi rend="italic">did</hi> appear, they did so during a period of
    Parthian domination and the earliest types bore Syriac legends
    (Babelon 1893: 209-96; Hill 1922: xciv-cvii, 91-118, pls
    XII-XVII).</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P9"/>[9] Of the
    Seleucid, Abgarid and Roman cities very little survives by way
    of material remains. In a survey, Mango reviewed what is known
    of classical art in Mesopotamia and most of what survives comes
    from the period after A.D. 165, when the Roman involvement in
    Edessa became intense (Mango 1982: 117). Non-survival of
    earlier material is often ascribed to the continuous occupation
    of Edessa, but it is surprising how <hi rend="italic">little</hi> has survived
    and this suggests that Edessa was far from thoroughly
    hellenized, a suspicion voiced also by Ross (2001: 11-13).</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P10"/>[10]
    Perhaps the most characteristic survival of pre-Christian
    Edessa is that of the mosaics, mostly funerary mosaics set on
    the floors of tomb-chambers. The mosaics all appear to date
    from the early 3<hi rend="sup">rd</hi> century A.D., though a recently
    published mosaic is dated a little earlier, to A.D. 194 (Healey
    2006). They are of great interest in themselves and point to
    Edessa’s cultural contact at this period with Roman
    Antioch: the concept of mosaic-making must have come from that
    direction. Interestingly, though, by far the majority of the
    mosaics follow artistic norms which are non-Antiochene: they
    bear Syriac rather than Greek inscriptions, presumably because
    the patrons knew no Greek or did not regard it as important.
    And they show a distinctive local art which is non-Western (and
    has often, with insufficient justification, been called
    Parthian). In a few cases a rather wooden rendering of a
    western model is involved (as in the case of the Orpheus and
    Phoenix mosaics).</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P11"/>[11]
    There are also a few non-funerary mosaics which appear to have
    been used as decor in villas and these <hi rend="italic">are</hi> thoroughly
    Antiochene in inspiration, containing mythological and
    legendary scenes (e.g. the mosaics now in the Bible Lands
    Museum in Jerusalem depicting Achilles, Patroclus and Briseis:
    Drijvers and Healey 1999: Cm3, Cm4), and one of these, from
    outside Edessa, depicting the river Euphrates and dated A.D.
    227, has a bilingual Syriac and Greek legend (Bm1). These more
    westernized mosaics give the impression, however, of being
    prestige items created by non-native craftsmen for the new
    Roman citizens of the third century and in any case they do not
    prove earlier hellenization (for the dating of the mosaics:
    Colledge 1994; Healey 2006).</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P12"/>[12]
    Although there is a lack of <hi rend="italic">archaeological</hi> (artefactual)
    evidence for hellenism in pre-Roman and pre-Christian Edessa,
    we do have some <hi rend="italic">literary</hi> evidence from the earliest
    surviving Syriac literature which might suggest a mixed culture
    at Edessa even in the pre-Christian period, though one must
    again be wary of exaggeration.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P13"/>[13]
    There are texts like the letter of Mara bar Serapion, the date
    of which is much disputed. Fergus Millar (1993: 460-62)
    evidently leans towards the 70s A.D., but it has been ascribed
    to a much later date by Kathleen McVey (1990). An early date
    might suggest that at least for the elite of society, such
    things as Greek mythology were familiar. This is confirmed for
    the third century, as we have seen, by the mythological and
    literary themes in the non-funerary mosaics. Apart from
    Achilles and Patroclus, we also find Zeus and Hera represented.
    There are also literary figures from the surrounding area,
    though not Edessa itself, who might be taken into account:
    Lucian of Samosata and Tatian.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P14"/>[14] But
    perhaps the most iconic figure in the cultural environment of
    Edessa itself is Bardaisan (A.D. 154-222). If the direct
    quotations from Bardaisan which have survived and the dialogue,
    <hi rend="italic">The Book of the Laws of Countries</hi>, are an accurate
    reflection of his teaching, they give us an insight into what
    appears to be a philosophical school at Edessa. Bardaisan was a
    Christian, but walked a tightrope between paganism and
    Christianity. He can be seen as trying to juggle Christianity,
    Greek philosophy and Semitic culture. One cannot help but
    admire his effort, even if it was inevitable that he was going
    to fall foul of Christian orthodoxy once it came into
    existence. Han Drijvers, in his book on Bardaisan (1966) and in
    numerous articles, was able to build up for us a very full
    picture, and there can be no doubt that Bardaisan was well
    versed in contemporary Greek philosophy. But so far as we know
    he wrote in <hi rend="italic">Syriac</hi>, not in Greek, and it is easy to
    overlook the extent to which he is dependent on a <hi rend="italic">local</hi>
    cultural tradition despite his awareness of things Greek.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P15"/>[15] Thus
    the evidence for regarding Edessa before the mid-2<hi rend="sup">nd</hi>
    century A.D. as extensively hellenized is really rather thin
    and it suggests the need for caution. What survives of
    Bardaisan’s thought is the only <hi rend="italic">substantial</hi>
    indication of hellenistic culture and there is a possibility
    that his hellenism was restricted to a very narrow circle
    associated with the court. Beyond this circle there is little
    evidence. It may be that whatever earlier hellenization had
    taken place in the Seleucid context practically disappeared
    under the Abgarids.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P16"/>[16] It
    seems to me, therefore, that the cultural background of the
    emergence of Syriac and its development as a literary language
    is best regarded as predominantly Semitic and traditional.
    Pre-Christian Edessa worshipped traditional local deities like
    Sin, Baalshamin, Shamash, Nebo and Bel, not Greek gods, and
    employed an art which may have some hellenistic/Roman features,
    but which is nonetheless marked heavily as local. And as
    Sebastian Brock has noted, there is in the earliest evidence of
    <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> Edessa a noticeable absence of classical
    baggage. In the Peshitta of Acts 14: 12 the Greek divine name
    Zeus is not transcribed as <hi rend="italic">zews</hi>, as it could have been,
    but given an <hi rend="italic">interpretatio syriaca</hi> as <hi rend="italic">Mārē
    alāhē</hi>, “lord of the gods”, a title
    used in Edessan inscriptions of Sin and Baalshamin (Brock 1982:
    19; Drijvers and Healey 1999: 80).</p>
         <head xml:id="HV10N2Healey4">II. The impact of the Greek language on Edessa and
    on pre-Christian Syriac</head>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P17"/>[17] The
    presence of Greek loans in the early Syriac inscriptions and
    parchments would in general be an indicator of Greek cultural
    influence on pre-Christian Edessa and its language. This has
    been discussed in several earlier works and there is no attempt
    here to enter into all the details (cf. Schall 1960; Healey
    1995; Brock 1996). In an article published in 1995 I chose to
    contrast the incidence of Greek loans in Old Syriac with the
    incidence of Greek loans in early Nabataean. Old Syriac seems
    at first sight to have many more loans. However, the
    distribution of the Greek loans in the Syriac inscriptions and
    parchments deserves closer scrutiny.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P18"/>[18]
    Seventeen out of the twenty-one clear Greek loans (data
    summarized in Drijvers and Healey 1999: 30-32) appear
    <hi rend="italic">only</hi> in the legal parchments, almost all in the context
    of introductory dating formulae, and it is hardly surprising to
    find them used, since these texts come from the 240s A.D. and
    already the legal context was a Roman one. This is clear from
    the more numerous <hi rend="italic">Greek</hi> legal texts in the Feissel and
    Gascou cache (1989) to which two of the three Syriac legal
    texts belong. The texts are Romanized presumably because their
    legal content might have to be defended in a Roman court.
    (There is an interesting parallel here with the switch from
    Nabataean to Greek after A.D. 106 in the legal texts from the
    Babatha archive.)</p>
         <p>

    point here is that this is a meagre inventory of Greek
    linguistic influence and it all suggests the appearance of
    Greek words in Edessa is mostly connected with Romanization in
    the third century A.D. Before that period the Syriac
    inscriptions are free of Greek influences and indeed Syriac is
    virtually the only language attested east of the Euphrates
    (Brock 1994: 152). An epigraphic exception to this last point
    may be the bilingual Amashamash tomb inscription from just
    south of Edessa: it could date as early as the 1<hi rend="sup">st</hi>
    century (Millar 1993: 462), though a later date is more likely
    (Drijvers and Healey 1999: As62).</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P21"/>[21] It
    is useful to compare this situation with Palmyrene and
    Nabataean. At Palmyra, Greek was very widely used because of
    more direct Roman influence (most recently Taylor 2002). As for
    Nabataea, Romanization did not much affect Petra until after
    the Roman annexation in A.D. 106, apart from some architectural
    imitations of styles from adjacent territories. There is only
    one securely dated pre-annexation Greek inscription at Petra, a
    bilingual which seems to have been erected by a family
    especially conscious of its Greco-Roman connections (Sartre
    1993: no. 54).</p>

    Broadly, after the demise of the Achaemenid Empire, the
    Achaemenid Aramaic <hi rend="italic">lingua franca</hi> had, in the absence of
    the empire, no function and largely disappeared. What remained
    were the local Aramaic dialects in each region where Aramaic
    was spoken as a vernacular. Gradually these local dialects were
    turned into literary or official languages. How this worked in
    practice depended, however, on local circumstances. In the
    Seleucid cities <hi rend="italic">Greek</hi> became the official language. In
    Nabataea Aramaic was replaced at least in some circles by a
    form of Arabic, though a distinctly conservative,
    Achaemenid-type Aramaic continued to be used for official
    purposes.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P24"/>[24] So
    how did Syriac emerge?</p>
         <p>Syriac is the local Aramaic of the Edessa region. Beyer
    (1984: 46; 1986: 31) noted, however, that its use as a state
    language and the opportunity for its development into a
    literary language must have been thrown into doubt by the
    Seleucid refoundation of Edessa, with Greek as the official
    language, even if Greek has left little trace. The local
    dialect of Aramaic might never have been turned into a written
    language, as happened to vernaculars in other Greek-dominated
    regions.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P25"/>[25] In
    fact, however, the spoken use of the Aramaic of the area
    continued throughout the period of Seleucid control. Whether
    this Edessan Aramaic was written down at all during this period
    is not known with any certainty. Perhaps suggestive of
    <hi rend="italic">some</hi> continuity is the evidence of Achaemenid (and
    Arsacid) orthographic influence in Old Syriac when it first
    appears in written form (Beyer 1966). There is also the
    evidence of the later legal texts, the parchments from the A.D.
    240s, which contain legal formulae which clearly go back to the
    Achaemenid period and earlier, bearing comparison with the
    Samaria papyri. It thus seems likely that the writing as well
    as the speaking of the local Aramaic of the Edessan region
    continued during this time.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P26"/>[26]
    Edessan Aramaic — Syriac — begins to re-emerge with
    the Abgarid dynasty around 140-130 B.C., being adopted for
    public use probably as part of the assertion of a non-Greek
    identity. As the local Aramaic dialect emerged, there developed
    for it a local variety of the earlier Aramaic script. Both
    script and language are well established by the time of the
    earliest dated Syriac inscription, the Birecik inscription of 6
    A.D., in which a local official, a <hi style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">
               <hi rend="italic">šallī<hi style="text-decoration: underline">t</hi>ā</hi>
            </hi>, writes
    his own tomb-inscription in Syriac (As55).</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P27"/>[27] The
    transformation of this early epigraphic Syriac used for
    official purposes into a prestigious literary language is also
    remarkable (though one can ask the same question about many
    languages known in their earliest form through non-literary
    epigraphs). Three specific factors may be noted:</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P28"/>[28]
    First, Syriac had already, in the earliest evidence available
    to us, become an <hi rend="italic">administrative</hi> language. The
    administrative language of the Abgarid dynasty was Aramaic
    rather than Greek. The major evidence here is provided by
    Syriac legal texts. Even though these are late (from the 240s
    A.D.), they are part of a whole legal tradition and prove
    incontrovertibly that the Syriac form of Aramaic had continued
    to be used in such contexts. The Greek legal texts found with
    them, on the other hand, must certainly be an innovation of the
    Romanizing period (not an inheritance from the Seleucid
    period).</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P29"/>[29]
    Secondly, Syriac became a <hi rend="italic">royal</hi> language. It became a
    royal language in the sense that the dynasty of Edessa chose to
    write inscriptions in it rather than in Greek (which must have
    been a feasible alternative at the end of Seleucid rule). While
    the Edessan kings did not produce historical inscriptions in
    the normal sense, they <hi rend="italic">did</hi> produce coins with Syriac
    legends, before Greek legends and Roman style supervened. And
    the elite of the kingdom chose to write its inscriptions in
    Syriac, as we can see from the Birecik inscription and the
    later inscriptions of a military character at Sumatar
    (especially those referring to the governors of different
    districts: As31 and 47, etc.). There is also the famous
    inscription on the pillar on the Urfa citadel dedicated to a
    queen of Edessa (As1).</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P30"/>[30]
    Above all Syriac became a <hi rend="italic">religious</hi> language. While most
    of the well preserved early inscriptions are funerary and
    simple commemorative texts, which do, of course, reveal some
    religious sentiments, there is also a small number of
    inscriptions, especially from Sumatar Harabesi, which have a
    more directly religious purpose (As36 and 37; also the altar
    inscription Bs3).</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P31"/>[31] A
    further factor, beyond the scope of this paper, is that there
    was an early interest in translating religious texts into
    Syriac and these translations had a part in raising Syriac to a
    new level, especially when the Bible began to be translated
    into Syriac. By that time Bardaisan was probably writing
    philosophical works in Syriac and poets were composing

            <anchor corresp="P32"/>[32] I do
    not want to advocate a romanticized view of the early Edessan
    environment of Syriac Christianity as unsullied by the
    “bitter poison of the wisdom of the Greeks” as
    Ephrem calls it (<hi rend="italic">de Fide</hi> II, 24). On present evidence,
    however, though Bardaisan may form a prominent peak of
    hellenism, it is not clear that he is the tip of an iceberg of
    any great significance. That there was Greek culture in Edessa
    is clear, but much more clear is the underlying dominance of
    native religious and linguistic tradition. If Greek had been at
    all prominent in Edessa the Greek text of the gospels would
    have sufficed, as it did in Antioch. Instead, for the whole
    society, including the elite (apart possibly from the few who
    partook in the kind of intellectual activity which preoccupied
    Bardaisan), it was this need in the religious sphere which was
    answered by Syriac, a local language which had come to written
    prominence during the reign of the Abgarid dynasty, used for
    administration and religion, by kings and people alike. At the
    end of this process, to quote Sebastian Brock, “... it
    was Christianity which lent to Syriac the requisite prestige to
    enable it to compete with Greek as a literary language
    ...” (Brock 1994: 155). It is hard to credit, however,
    Noeldeke’s remark (1904: xxxii) to the effect that the
    Edessan dialect “was employed as a literary language,
    certainly long before the introduction of Christianity”:
    there seems to be no clear evidence of this.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P33"/>[33] So
    far as the title of this paper is concerned, “The Edessan
    Milieu and the Birth of Syriac”, my conclusion is that in
    the formative period the Edessan milieu was not hellenized to
    any significant extent, while Syriac’s ancestry is to be
    sought in the local Aramaic dialects of northern Mesopotamia,
    gradually transformed into a prestige language of religious
    literature.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P34"/>[34] This
    brings us back to the issue of variety within this early
    Syriac. The major variation, <hi rend="italic">y-</hi>prefix and
    <hi rend="italic">n-</hi>prefix imperfect forms, can be interpreted either
    diachronically (with the classical form emerging c. A.D. 200)
    or synchronically (and accounted for as reflecting different
    <hi rend="italic">varieties</hi> of Aramaic/Syriac). The latter explanation is,
    in my view, more plausible. Indeed, linguistic variation
    continued beyond the birth of Syriac and into the
    “classical” phase, as Lucas van Rompay has shown
    convincingly in a paper of 1994 (see also Joosten 1999; Brock
    2003).</p>_______<lb/>

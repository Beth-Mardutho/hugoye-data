                <p xml:lang="en"><pb n="153"/>This book, the result of a collective work, provides the Italian translations, with short introductions and essential notes, of the 23 
					<hi rend="italic">Demonstrations</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">Expositions</hi>, by <ref target="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Aphrahat">Aphrahat</ref>, “the Persian sage,” for his fellow ascetics, the “children [i.e. members] of the covenant.” Besides Lenzi 
					(general introduction, <hi rend="italic">Dem</hi>. 3, 4, 6, 10, 11, 13, 18, 21, 23), the translators and commentators include Vittorio Berti (<hi rend="italic">Dem</hi>. 1), Monica Casadei (<hi rend="italic">Dem</hi>. 2), 
					Sabino Chialà (<hi rend="italic">Dem</hi>. 8), Ignazio de Francesco (<hi rend="italic">Dem</hi>. 12), Igor Dorfmann-Lazarev (introductory letter), Alessandro Mengozzi (<hi rend="italic">Dem</hi>. 16), Marco Moriggi (<hi rend="italic">Dem</hi>. 15), 
					Manel Nin (<hi rend="italic">Dem</hi>. 19, 20), René Roux (<hi rend="italic">Dem</hi>. 17), Claudia Tavolieri (<hi rend="italic">Dem</hi>. 14), and Emidio Vergani (<hi rend="italic">Dem</hi>. 5, 7, 22). The introduction by Lenzi (pp. 7–45) provides a 
					helpful contextualization. It explains what is known about Aphrahat and his name, his historical and religious context, and the expansion of Christianity in 
					Mesopotamia. A general presentation of the <hi rend="italic">Demonstrations</hi> follows, including a discussion of their grouping and the authenticity of <hi rend="italic">Dem</hi>. 14, which Lenzi 
					upholds. Comments are devoted to Aphrahat’s Creed, his notions of faith and sacraments, his ecclesiology, soteriology, and “theology of substitution,” his use 
					of the Bible, and the manuscripts, editions, and ancient translations of the <hi rend="italic">Demonstrations</hi>. While there seems to be no new, ground-breaking research 
					offered, this is a useful and detailed introduction; the intended audience is learned though not specialized readers; all <ref target="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Syriac-Language">Syriac</ref> is transliterated and 
					translated. The <hi rend="italic">Demonstrations</hi> had already been translated into English, German, and French.

					The present translation is generally good and careful; most introductions to single <hi rend="italic">Demonstrations</hi> are little more than resumes of

					themes.
				</p>
                <p xml:lang="en"><pb n="154"/>In his Introduction, Lenzi rightly takes the epitaph of Abercius as evidence that by the end of the second century Christians were found not only everywhere in Syria, but also in Nisibis and all beyond the Euphrates (17).
						<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn2" n="2">
							<p rend="footnote text">On the complexity of this document and the interpretive problems surrounding it, see Margaret Mitchell, “The Poetics and 
							Politics of Christian Baptism in the Abercius Monument,” in David Hellholm et al., eds., <hi rend="italic">Ablution, Initiation, and Baptism</hi> (Berlin: De Gruyter, 2011), 
							1743–1777, not cited by Lenzi, and my “L’epitafio di Abercio,” <hi rend="italic">Aevum</hi> 74 (2000), 191–206, cited.</p>
						</note>  
					Similar documentary evidence concerning the diffusion of Christianity toward the end of the second century is correctly deduced by Lenzi also from the
					<hi rend="italic">Liber legum regionum</hi> stemming from the school of <ref target="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Bardaisan">Bardaisan</ref> of <ref target="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Edessa">Edessa</ref>. 
				</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">Also in the Introduction, Lenzi’s dating of the oldest layers of the <ref target="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Old-Syriac-Version"><hi rend="italic">Vetus Syra</hi></ref>—the Old Syriac version of the New Testament—to the second century 
					is the most probable. Aphrahat was acquainted both with <ref target="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Tatian">Tatian</ref>’s Gospel harmony, the <ref target="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Diatessaron"><hi rend="italic">Diatessaron</hi></ref>, and with the four separate Gospels. Besides remarking upon 
					the archaism and simplicity of Aphrahat’s creed, Lenzi also observes that the Persian sage was far from the Logos theology of Justin, <ref target="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Clement-of-Rome-and-Pseudo-Clementine-literature">Clement</ref>, Origen, and 
					the like—to whom I would add also Bardaisan, with whose ideas, however, Aphrahat seems to have been familiar (as I suggest below). Aphrahat, I would observe, 
					renders <hi rend="italic">logos</hi> simply with “word, discourse” or even “voice.”
						<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn3" n="3">
							<p rend="footnote text">In this connection I add Jesús Luzarraga, <hi rend="italic">El Evangelio de Juan en las versiones siríacas</hi> (Rome: Pontifical Biblical Institute, 2008).</p>
						</note>
					On the contrary, Bardaisan used a rich double translation of <hi rend="italic">logos</hi>, which takes into account 
					not only the meaning “word,” but also the meaning “reason, reasoning”: “the Word of Thought,” attested in the so-called cosmological traditions.
						<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn4" n="4">

						</note>
					In other respects, however, Aphrahat displays impressive similarities with Bardaisan. In <hi rend="italic">Dem</hi>. 4.5–6 Aphrahat employs twice the very same expression that was 
					used by Bardaisan in reference to the Cross of Christ: “the Mystery [<hi rend="italic">rāzā</hi>] of the Cross.” Aphrahat is speaking of the ladder of Jacob and affirms: “essa è 
					anche il Mistero della Croce del nostro Salvatore” (“it is also the Mystery of the Cross of our Savior,” section 5) and “Giacobbe vide la scala che è il
					Mistero della Croce” (“Jacob saw the ladder, that is the Mystery of the Cross,” section 6). Bardaisan <pb n="155"/>employed exactly the same expression in reference to
					Christ’s cross and its symbolic meaning both in the “cosmological traditions” and in a Greek fragment preserved by <ref target="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Porphyry">Porphyry</ref>.

							<p rend="footnote text">See my <hi rend="italic">Bardaisan of Edessa</hi>, 107–124.</p>
						</note>
				</p>
				<p xml:lang="en">In <hi rend="italic">Dem</hi>. 23, which is the last extant and perhaps was meant to be the beginning of a new series, in section 67 Aphrahat launches into a series of 
					Ecclesiastes-style remarks on the instability of the world. He gives several examples, such as that some people desire wealth but never attain it, since this 
					is taken away from them and given to others. And some beget children but cannot rejoice in them, because these die or are deported, or else dishonor their 
					parents. It is striking, although not noted in the volume under review, that the very same examples were produced by <ref target="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Mara-bar-Serapion-Letter-of">Mara bar Serapion</ref> (probably writing in 
					the late first century A.D., although later dates are also supported by scholars) in his own remarks about the instability of the world in his letter to his 
					son: “Let your mind not turn to the desire of wealth, something which is not true. For wealth does not endure…Some acquire wealth with much labor, and others 
					inherit what they did not own…What things can one mention as enduring? Abundant wealth? This is taken away. Children? They die…I have experienced men, and I 
					have done so in the following way: that they only aim at abundant wealth…They are attached to the majesty of riches, the serious vice of the corrupt.” A 
					passage from the <hi rend="italic">Liber legum regionum</hi> by the school of Bardaisan, too, comes very close to Aphrahat’s reflections both about children and about riches: “And
					many beget children and yet do not bring them up, and others do bring them up, and yet they do not retain them, and others retain them, and these become a 
					tribulation and a source of afflictions. And others are wealthy, as they wish, and yet are ill, as they would not want.” Even the reference to deportation, 
					which is repeated twice in Aphrahat’s passage, perfectly corresponds to the historical setting of Mara’s letter, which entailed a deportation of people from 
					Samosata by the Romans.

						</note>
				</p>
				<p xml:lang="en">The impression of a possible relation between Aphrahat and Mara (and Bardaisan) is reinforced by a similar catalogue in Aphrahat’s <hi rend="italic">Dem</hi>. 22.9–10, 
					likewise focused on the instability of this <pb n="156"/>world. Those who are rich—says Aphrahat—cannot enjoy their wealth; those who have children are afflicted by death. 
					No generation has ever been spared by death, nobody has ever been able to bring his riches with himself after death. But wisdom is a perpetual richness. 
					Mara bar Serapion likewise maintained that “nobody has ever been deprived of his or her wisdom, but rather of his or her riches…Apply yourself to wisdom, 
					source of all goods and inexhaustible treasure.”

						</note>
					Aphrahat lists several just who were unjustly persecuted and killed, including Jesus (<hi rend="italic">Dem</hi>. 14.45). The same did Mara in his letter (again the parallel is not noticed in the volume), and 
					he too included Jesus, “the wise king of the Jews,” in Mara’s words. Mara introduces the section on the persecuted wise as follows: “For what else should we 
					say when the wise are treated with violence by tyrants, and their wisdom is made prisoner by slander, and in their intelligence they are oppressed without the 
					opportunity of defending themselves?” In addition, Aphrahat’s comments on these persecuted just are the very same as Mara’s. Aphrahat remarks: “They have 
					survived by virtue of their teaching, and their good name endures for future generations.” It is surprising that the Christian Aphrahat does not rather claim 
					that these saints enjoy eternal life with God as a reward for their being persecuted iniquitously. He focuses, instead, on the “earthly” survival of these 
					just in the memory of posterity. But this is precisely what Mara, the “pagan” Stoic, maintained about the persecuted just and Jesus himself, in line with his 
					sentence, “The lives of human beings pass away from the world, my son, but their praises and virtues endure forever.” According to Mara’s letter, Jesus has 
					survived in the new laws (in relation to the Mosaic law) that he promulgated. Very interestingly, in <hi rend="italic">Dem</hi>. 2, on Christian love, Aphrahat claims with regard to 
					Jesus and the Jewish people: “poiché ripudiarono la sua regalità, sollevò da loro la regalità” (“because they rejected his being king, God removed from them 
					their kingdom,” section 6). Now, once again, this connection is the very same as that established by Mara in his <pb n="157"/>letter: because the Jews rejected their own 
					king (<hi rend="italic">malkā</hi>), they were deprived by God of their kingdom (<hi rend="italic">malkutā</hi>): “What advantage did the Jews have from the execution of their wise king, since from that 
					time onward their kingdom was removed?” The parallel is striking, even though of course it cannot demonstrate by itself a sure dependence of Aphrahat on Mara.
				</p>
				<p xml:lang="en">In the same <hi rend="italic">Demonstration</hi>, Aphrahat returns to the theme of the destruction of <ref target="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</ref> in A.D. 70 as a punishment. He states: “Quando essi però 
					versarono il sangue del giusto, non ebbe pietà di Gerusalemme, ma la consegnò nella mano dei suoi nemici” (“But when they shed the blood of the just, God did 
					not take pity on Jerusalem, but He delivered it into the hands of its enemies,” <hi rend="italic">Dem</hi>. 14.13). No comment is found in the footnotes about the identity of this 
					“just,” and in light of section 6, cited above, I deem it probable that this is again Jesus. At any rate it is worth remarking that there was an early 
					Christian tradition that identified this “just,” whose killing determined the siege and destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans, with James the Just, the 
					so-called brother of Jesus, who was killed by will of the high priest Ananus (Hannah) in A.D. 62. The causal connection between his murder and the siege of 
					Jerusalem was established by the second-century historian Hegesippus, who was known to, and quoted by, <ref target="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Eusebius-of-Caesarea">Eusebius</ref> in the early fourth century. Hegesippus, 
					indeed, just after narrating the execution of James, adds that the Romans “immediately” began to besiege Jerusalem. This is a patent anachronism, since eight 
					full years in fact elapsed between the two events, but Hegesippus clearly intended to construe the unjust killing of the Just as the cause of the destruction 
					of Jerusalem.

					This tradition, which was known to Origen before Eusebius, might have been known to Aphrahat as well.
				</p>
				<p xml:lang="en">While it is possible, and even probable, that Aphrahat knew Mara’s Syriac letter, it is unlikely that he knew Origen’s works. Although in <hi rend="italic">Dem</hi>. 21 
					he expresses the same ideas as Origen, the convergence is too small to be indicative of a dependency. Indeed, in this <hi rend="italic">Demonstration</hi> Aphrahat indicates that 
					the saints may well be <pb n="158"/>suffering, but this is not a sign that they are persecuted by God. Likewise, Origen remarks that one cannot think that the righteous 
					are abandoned by God when some illness or disability or the like befalls them, because “such things usually happen precisely to the just!” (<hi rend="italic">haec maxime iustis 
					accidere solent</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Hom. in Ps</hi>. 36.4.3). And these are not abandoned by God.
				</p>
				<p xml:lang="en">Not only Mara bar Serapion is possibly echoed by Aphrahat in more than one <hi rend="italic">Demonstration</hi>, as I have suggested, but also Bardaisan. I have already 
					mentioned a possible parallel, and I shall now point out more parallels and probable interactions. All of these possible references go unnoticed in the book 
					under review, perhaps because of their elusiveness and lack of certainty, but they are definitely worth noticing. In <hi rend="italic">Dem</hi>. 14—the same in which I have already 
					detected possible echoes from Mara, whose letter by the way was preserved in the very same manuscript as the <hi rend="italic">Liber legum regionum</hi> from Bardaisan’s 
					school—Aphrahat seems to be not only alluding, but also explicitly responding, to an argument put forward by Bardaisan precisely in the <hi rend="italic">Liber</hi>. Indeed, in 
					sections 36–37 Aphrahat notes that all other creatures of God do the will of God, but human beings often do not. He adds that these creatures, such as heaven, 
					earth, waters, fire, and animals, behave like that not simply by nature, but specifically in abidance of God’s will: “If someone claims, ‘They are prisoners 
					of their nature,’ let him understand what happened in the days of Noah…” (<hi rend="italic">Dem</hi>. 14.36–37). I deem it very probable that the “someone” whom Aphrahat has in 
					mind here is Bardaisan, as represented in the <hi rend="italic">Liber</hi>. For there he precisely argued that animals and natural elements such as water, earth, fire, and so forth 
					are governed by nature and obey its law (as distinct from both fate and free will). Aphrahat wants to correct this thesis: he maintains that they are not 
					governed by nature, but directly by the will of God. In <hi rend="italic">Dem</hi>. 13, however, which is devoted to the Sabbath, Aphrahat agrees with Bardaisan that animals, albeit 
					they do the will of God, are not endowed with free will, and therefore they have no moral law and no sin (<hi rend="italic">Dem</hi>. 13.2).
				</p>
				<p xml:lang="en">It is probable that also in <hi rend="italic">Dem</hi>. 8 Aphrahat is referring to Bardaisan and his followers, in this case to criticize their notion of the 
					resurrected body. This specific criticism was suggested, I think <pb n="159"/>rightly, by Thomas McGlothlin,
						<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn10" n="10">
							<p rend="footnote text">In a communication at the Syriac Symposium at Duke University in June 2011.</p>
						</note>
					on the basis of my analysis of Bardaisan’s notion of the resurrection in <hi rend="italic">Bardaisan of Edessa</hi>. Indeed, Aphrahat here observes that some unnamed Christian adversaries maintained that the dead will rise, to be sure, 
					but take up a heavenly body and spiritual forms, because Paul declared that heavenly bodies are different from earthly bodies (1 Cor 15:40). Also, in 
					<hi rend="italic">Dem</hi>. 8.17–19 Aphrahat clearly embraces the notion of spiritual death—the death of the soul—as the real death, an idea shared by Bardaisan, Origen, and earlier 
					by Philo, some Platonists, and Stoics.

				<p xml:lang="en">Like <ref target="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Gregory-of-Nyssa">Gregory of Nyssa</ref>, Aphrahat presents the life of ascetics as a prelude to eschatology (<hi rend="italic">Dem</hi>. 7.18), and the volume under review in general is

					Another tiny addition could be suggested for p. 79, on <hi rend="italic">Dem</hi>. 1.18. Since Biblical references are usually indicated in the notes, when Aphrahat states that faith “has 
					humbled the superb and has exalted the humble” one may add a note with a reference to the Blessed Virgin’s Magnificat Hymn in Luke 1:51–52: “He has scattered 
					the proud in the imagination of their hearts; he has put down the mighty from their thrones, and has exalted the humble.” In addition, concerning possible 
					quotations of, and echoes from, 3 Corinthians in Aphrahat’s <hi rend="italic">Demonstrations</hi>, it is now worth adding a fine study by J. Edward Walters that the authors could 
					obviously not take into consideration.

					Walters argues that Aphrahat indeed quoted this pseudepigraphon, considered it to be a letter by St. Paul, and drew 
					from it important motifs.

				<p xml:lang="en"><pb n="160"/>This is a careful book, also from the editorial point of view. There are very few typos, but note that on p. 229 “termine” should be deleted in 
					the phrase “è terminata termine l’esposizione sui pastori,” so as to read, “The Demonstration concerning the shepherds is finished.” Italian readers who do 
					not know Syriac or any of the other languages into which the <hi rend="italic">Demonstrations</hi> had been already translated, will be grateful to this team of scholars for making 
					Aphrahat’s inspiring work accessible to them.

            <anchor corresp="P1"/>[1] On 22-23
    July 2003, at the latest International Meeting of the Society
    of Biblical Literature (in Cambridge, England) a number of
    scholars from around the world met to discuss Syriac
    lexicography and to present papers to each other on various
    germane subjects. This group had been brought together by Terry
    C. Falla of Whitley College of the University of Melbourne, and
    will continue to convene annually during the International
    Meetings of the SBL.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P2"/>[2] The
    group is purposely constituted of scholars with a range of
    interests and specialities: computing, theoretical linguistics,
    syntax, translation technique, ecclesiastical literature,
    biblical versions, pedagogy, publishing, etc., and as well as
    being committed to producing tools to aid the study of Syriac
    also seeks to be a forum for the scholarly cross-fertilization
    of ideas. The group has the following mission statement:</p>

    Intimately connected with the conception of this project is

    volumes of the <hi rend="italic">Key</hi> will appear soon and its method
    will then be extended to include the rest of the Syriac New
    Testament. All this information will be incorporated into a
    database, which can be expanded to include other corpora such
    as the works of Ephrem. At the same time as the possibilities
    of a versatile database are explored the ISLP will seek to be
    at the cutting edge of lexicography from a linguistic
    perspective. As can be seen from the summaries of some of the
    papers, issues that are raised often also have considerable
    relevance to languages other than Syriac.</p>

            <anchor corresp="P5"/>[5] In order
    to provide a background to the papers presented at this
    conference David Taylor in his opening paper surveyed the
    development of Syriac lexicography from the fourth-century
    Syriac-Coptic glossary found in the Dakhleh Oasis of Egypt to
    the most recent dictionaries published by scholars of the
    Syrian/Assyrian churches in Kerala, Iraq, and Germany. (An
    annotated handlist of the printed lexica will be included as an
    appendix to the proceedings of the conference.) Particular
    attention was paid to the large Syriac-Arabic dictionaries
    produced in the 'first renaissance' environment of Abbasid
    Baghdad, to the revived interest in Syriac lexicography in the
    sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, and to the great standard
    reference works published in the late nineteenth century in
    Europe (Payne Smith and Brockelmann) and the Middle East
    (Qardahi, Brun, Audo, and Manna).</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P6"/>[6] The
    strengths and weaknesses of these various works were outlined,
    and Taylor especially emphasized the important contribution
    made by the middle-eastern lexica, which are too often
    overlooked by European and North American scholars. Arguing
    that the time had not yet come for a new comprehensive
    'Thesaurus Syriacus', the speaker then sought to identify a
    number of practical and useful tasks that could be undertaken
    by Syriac lexicographers, present and future, such as: lists of
    lexemes supplementing the present lexica; concordances to key
    Syriac authors; and article and monograph size studies of the
    development of Syriac word formation, the use of Greek and
    other loan words, and of terminology specific to certain
    subject areas, such as philosophy, Christology, and
    medicine.</p>

    Conceptual Framework for a New Comprehensive Syriac-English
    Lexicon</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P7"/>[7] For many
    reasons the time has come to reassess the theory and practice
    of classical Syriac lexicography and discuss what kind of
    Syriac-English lexicon would best serve the needs of the
    twenty-first century. The paper begins with how the scholars
    who contributed to this volume came together. It then outlines
    the need for a new Syriac-English lexicon and proposes a
    conceptual framework for a comprehensive lexicon to the Syriac
    New Testament with the aim of that framework providing a basis
    for the lexicalizing of other Syriac literature.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P8"/>[8] Five
    basic questions are addressed: for whom is the work intended
    (audience), what sort of information should be included
    (content), how much should be included (scope), how is that
    information to be ascertained (methodology), and how can it be
    organized in a user-friendly manner that is methodologically
    compatible with its contents and is aesthetically pleasing
    (arrangement and presentation)? A concluding section considers
    issues of implementation and comments on the need for a
    collaborative approach that draws on the insights of various
    specialist disciplines to complement the expertise of the
    lexicographer. The essay ends with a tribute marking the
    centenary of Jessie Payne Smith's <hi rend="italic">A Compendious Syriac
    Dictionary</hi> founded upon the <hi rend="italic">Thesaurus</hi> of R. Payne
    Smith.</p>

         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P9"/>[9] In any
    discussion of the shape of a new Syriac lexicon, the temptation
    is to focus on methodological issues from the point of view of
    the lexicographer and researcher. However, the needs of the
    majority of users, namely new learners of Syriac, should not be
    forgotten. Commercial considerations will also have a bearing
    on the project.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P10"/>[10] A
    new lexicon would have to be built up layer by layer, like a
    snowball, starting with the Gospels and then the New Testament,
    followed by other widely read texts such as the Peshitta Old
    Testament, Aphrahat and Ephrem. Other issues that would need to
    be discussed are the font and vocalization used; the inclusion
    of comparative philological data; the use of an intuitive
    abbreviation system; whether lemmata should be cited in
    alphabetical or root order, and in the emphatic or absolute
    form; the likely background of the lexicon's users and their
    aims in learning Syriac; and finally how to achieve
    typographical clarity for the work. The aim of the lexicon
    would be to be fully scientific while remaining as
    'user-friendly' as possible.</p>

         </p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P11"/>[11] The
    purpose of this paper is to sketch out general guidelines that
    can be taken into consideration for implementing a
    computational Syriac lexicon. The paper begins with an overview
    of previous lexical projects, starting from the encoding of
    Brockelmann's Lexicon Syriacum at UCLA in the 1960s. The schema
    of SEDRA III database model was presented to as an
    illustration.<lb/>

    system to model Syriac lexicography was sketched out. The model
    calls for capturing lexical and grammatical data, including
    phonology, morphology, syntax and semantics.</p>

            <hi style="font-style: italic; font-weight:normal">Squishes,

         </p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P13"/>[13] The
    Problem: Traditional views of part-of-speech classes see them
    as hard, 'either/or' categories. Several analysts have shown
    that (morphologically-defined) parts of speech may overlap (are
    'mixed') and may be heterogeneous (are 'gradient'). How are we
    to detect and deal with such mixed and gradient classes so that
    a coherent taxonomy can be devised?</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P14"/>[14] Our
    Solution: Dealing with non-discrete syntactic classes is a
    four-stage process. 1. We first use contextual information
    about the classes to compute their distances apart. 2. We then
    use this set of distances to produce a hierarchical clustering
    of the classes, on the basis of which we define a set of
    super-classes. 3. Next, we use the distances among these
    super-classes to infer a one-dimensional continuum (Ross's
    class squish) along which the super-classes are ordered. 4.
    Based on the class squish ordering, we plot each text token in
    a context space in which mixed and gradient classes are
    discernable. (The paper concludes by outlining directions for
    future work.)</p>

         </p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P15"/>[15] The
    single question addressed by this paper is that of whether
    syntactic information should be included in the Syriac lexicon,
    and, if so, what type of syntactic information this should be,
    and how it should be presented. The lexicon is the domain of
    words, of lexemes. Do these in themselves have a lexical part
    of speech isolatable from all environmental questions, or are
    they merely a product of the interaction of the pattern of
    elements in which they appear? Is there a basic value from
    which the various syntactic functions of an item can be deduced
    on the basis of generally applicable linguistic rules?</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P16"/>[16] From
    a formal point of view, words display distinct contrastive and
    combinatorial functions. It is the lexicon where these unique
    properties can be stored. The fact that an element may function
    as different parts of speech in a specific environment is the
    systematic product of the interaction of the basic qualities of
    the element itself with the context in which it occurs. Though
    the various functions which an element may have could be
    entered into the lexicon as separate items, reference should be
    made to the basic form from which the other functions are
    derivable on the basis of consistently applied syntactic rules.
    Traced within an extensive text corpus, an element manifests a
    limited number of shifts in part of speech and the possible
    shifts within the language can be represented in a single
    unidirectional chain of parts of speech.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P17"/>[17]
    Three separate elements of the Syriac language are considered:
    the particle <hi rend="italic">dalath</hi>, the participle, and verbal
    valency. Though these three are diverse in nature, the approach
    advocated as to which information should be presented in the
    lexicon is uniform. Language data can be viewed as a limited
    number of simple elements which can be combined in accordance
    with a finite set of syntactic rules. This results in
    structures which can be described hierarchically as building
    blocks and their combinatory patterns. The lexicon should
    present the basic attributes of the entry, and may then go
    further to list other possibilities dependent on the particular
    environment, but it should not lose the link to the basic
    property from which the others are systematically
    derivable.</p>

            <hi style="font-style: italic; font-weight:normal">On
    Matching Syriac Words with Their Greek Vorlage</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P18"/>[18] The
    question that lexicographers of the Septuagint ask is whether
    the Hebrew supposed to underlie the Greek can legitimately be
    used as an indicator of the meaning of the Greek. Likewise
    Syriac lexicographers approaching the New Testament must ask to
    what extent the Greek should guide their understanding of the
    Syriac. This paper dwells on some of the difficulties involved
    in matching Syriac words with Greek ones and also on some of
    the counter-intuitive or surprising results that comparison of
    the Syriac and Greek leads us to. Examples are taken from the
    Old Syriac and Peshitta Gospels.</p>
         <list type="ordered">
            <item>Syriac can equate a 'gender-neutral' term in Greek with a
      'gendered' term in Syriac.</item>
            <item>The Syriac Gospels frequently reverse the order of a pair
      of items in the Greek (as occurs sometimes in the Old
      Testament Peshitta), so that in examples like John 10:1 the
      Syriac word corresponding to the Greek is not the one that a
      superficial reading would lead us to believe.</item>
            <item>Syriac prefers the unmarked verb <hi rend="italic">'mr</hi> to
      introduce speech, whereas Greek uses more varied vocabulary.
      Consequently <hi rend="italic">'mr</hi> can be fulfilling functions that we
      might not expect.</item>
            <item>Greek plurals may correspond to Syriac singulars and vice
      versa. This sometimes gives us insight into the
      correspondence between the number of entities denoted and
      grammatical number.</item>

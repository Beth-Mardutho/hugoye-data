                <p xml:lang="en">This volume examines the Church of the East in the Early Modern
                    era. East Syriac Christianity typically receives less scholarly attention during
                    this period, when it was no longer spread throughout Asia. The book looks at
                    East Syriac manuscripts and the scribes who wrote them, with particular
                    attention to scribal production in Mesopotamia. It includes an Introduction,
                    seven chapters and Conclusions, followed by three appendices, a bibliography and
                    an index.</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">The Introduction begins by challenging the “narrative of decline
                    that was shared by Western and Middle Eastern Christians” regarding the
                    19th-century history of the Church (p. 2). Inspired and informed by the works of
                    David Wilmshurst, Amir Harrak, Jean-Maurice Fiey, Alessandro Mengozzi and many
                    other scholars, Murre-van den Berg notes at the outset her view of manuscripts,
                    and particularly colophons, as “literary productions reflecting on the religious
                    world of their time” (pp. 7-8).</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">The author’s extensive knowledge of East Syriac manuscripts and her
                    ability to parse their data is on display throughout the volume. Three themes
                    underlie much of this study: 1) “the centrality of religious ritual and the
                    importance of the sacred as a living reality in everyday life”; 2) the notion of
                    manuscripts as “objects that function in the liturgical construction,” like
                    icons; and 3) the fact that “scribes... constitute an essential but often
                    overlooked part of the process [of manuscript production]” (pp. 14-15).</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">Chapter 1, <hi rend="italic">Patriarchs, Popes and
                        Missionaries</hi>, provides the general historical and religious background
                    to the period covered by the volume, including an overview of the Church of the
                    East prior to the mid-16th century. Much of the chapter concerns the most
                    significant factor of this era relative to East Syriac Christianity: its
                    complicated relationship with the Roman Catholic Church. The author does an
                    excellent job describing the vicissitudes of that relationship, as different
                    branches of the Church of the East allied themselves with Rome at different
                    times. The story is told with attention to facts, but in a manner that makes
                    sense out of the seemingly endless list of patriarchs named Eliya, Shimʿon or
                    Yosep. As the author notes, “this process was far from smooth...reasons for
                    conversion to Catholicism differed greatly” (p. 76).</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">Chapter 2, <hi rend="italic">The Production of Manuscripts</hi>,
                    examines technical aspects of manuscript production. The author notes that “the
                    substantial number of manuscripts that have survived...indicates a period of
                    considerable cultural, ecclesial and literary activity” in the Church of the
                    East (p. 80). Graphs accompany the discussion of when and where manuscripts were
                    produced and the chapter concludes with a lengthy and informative discussion of
                    various aspects of manuscript production (e.g., paper sourcing, writing styles,
                    manuscript decoration). On many of these topics, the author notes the need for
                    further study (pp. 101, 102, 103, 108, 109).</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">Chapter 3, <hi rend="italic">The Colophons</hi>, concerns that
                    aspect of manuscript production which is easily overlooked by non-specialists,
                    but which historians know can prove to be a goldmine of information on the
                    historical context of manuscript writing. As the author suggests, colophons
                    exert a “profound and central function in the economy of the textual culture”
                    (p. 141). The chapter breaks down the constituent parts of typical colophons
                    (title, date and place of writing, scribal and donor names) and discusses the
                    use in them of Syriac verbs, the Seleucid dating system and scribal
                    self-deprecation; she also remarks upon the many women who commissioned
                    manuscripts.</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">Chapter 4, <hi rend="italic">The Texts of the Ritual</hi>, begins
                    the second part of the volume by examining different types of liturgical texts
                    copied between 1500 and 1850. The author notes, “the majority of the manuscripts
                    from the Ottoman period are directly connected to the liturgical life of the
                    Church of the East” (p. 145). The chapter goes on to consider liturgical texts
                    in general, including how the liturgy developed in both traditional and Catholic
                    circles. Following this, specific liturgical texts are considered: biblical
                    lectionaries, <hi rend="italic">ʿonyatha</hi>, <hi rend="italic">soghyatha</hi>,
                        <hi rend="italic">ḥuttame</hi>, <hi rend="italic">turgame</hi> and funeral
                        <hi rend="italic">madrashe</hi>. As elsewhere in the volume, the need for
                    further study is frequently emphasized (pp. 155, 170, 177, 181). Interestingly,
                    some of these works were translated not only into Arabic, but also into Turkish
                    (pp. 163, 165).</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">Chapter 5, <hi rend="italic">Popular Prose and Poetry</hi>,
                    considers texts used apart from formal liturgical settings, primarily by
                    non-elites. Several types of texts are examined, including those of a
                    para-biblical or hagiographic nature, discussing “holy men and women [seen] as
                    visible and tangible signs of divine incarnation” (p. 195). The author reminds
                    us of “the highly fluid boundaries between Bible, apocrypha and hagiography in
                    the Syriac tradition” (p. 197). Protective texts constitute another category of
                    popular texts, whether booklets containing charms, anathemas and prayers of
                    protection as templates to be copied, or personalized scrolls and amulets
                    prepared for specific individuals. As the author observes, “in real life the gap
                    between religion as expressed in the communal liturgy and these protective
                    practices was nowhere near as great as later scholars and clergy have sometimes
                    suggested” (p. 215).</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">Chapter 6, <hi rend="italic">The Scriptures of the Learned</hi>,
                    examines texts used by clerical and scribal elites: biblical commentaries,
                    liturgical commentaries, canon law, theology, ascetic and devotional texts,
                    history, philosophy, grammar and personal texts. For both canon law and
                    theology, the name of ʿAwdishoʿ bar Brikha is prominent, but most new
                    theological works come from the Catholic camp. Catholic influence is also
                    apparent in the ascetic and devotional literature from this period, with many
                    translations of Western Catholic works. Personal texts from the period include
                    the fascinating Arabic travelogue of Ilyas ibn Ḥanna, narrating travels in the
                    Americas during the late 17th century. In conclusion, “the prevailing negative
                    views of the erudition of the clergy of the Church of the East” need to be
                    nuanced (p. 268). Again, the author reminds us throughout the chapter of the
                    need for more research (pp. 233, 244, 245, 256, 261, 262, 266).</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">Chapter 7, <hi rend="italic">Knowledge, Power and Mediation</hi>,
                    acts as a theoretical reflection on the large amount of data introduced in the
                    previous six chapters, by asking the question “What was it that the scribes of
                    these manuscripts intended to achieve with their writing?” In short, three
                    things: “the storage and transferral of knowledge, the attribution,
                    legitimisation and exertion of power, and the mediation of divine merit, grace
                    and power” (p. 271). Regarding knowledge, most texts from this period treasured
                    knowledge “of the ritual framework and its accompanying stories” (p. 274).
                    Concerning the legitimization of power, the colophons are key, benefitting not
                    only the reader, but also “those mentioned in the colophon [who] acquire power
                    by virtue of the special status of the text” (p. 282). Finally, “the mediation
                    of the divine [must be] included in the discussion” (p. 286). Liturgical texts
                    mediate divine power through rituals and prayers; protective texts do so as a
                    result of being “worn, stored and sometimes even eaten by those who ordered
                    them” (p. 288).</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">In the <hi rend="italic">Conclusions</hi>, the author again reminds
                    us of her attempts to counter the narrative of “stagnation and oppression” in
                    the Church of the East by seeing these centuries as ones of “recovery rather
                    than decline” (p. 293). We are reminded too of the contrast between “the
                    traditional socio-religious community,” loyal to the Church of the East, and
                    “the modernising and globalising middle class,” ultimately won over to
                    Catholicism (p. 294). As the author notes, “conversion to Catholicism directly
                    challenged existing power structures within the Church of the East” and
                    “reflected the search for a religion that fitted the circumstances better than
                    the type of East Syriac Christianity that had evolved in northern Mesopotamia”
                    (p. 295). In the end, that search for a religion able to engage with globalism
                    “neatly coincided with the interests of missionaries and other agents from the
                    Catholic West” (p. 296).</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">The volume closes with three helpful appendices. Appendix A is a
                    list of all patriarchs of the Church of the East and its various Chaldean
                    offshoots from ca. 1500 on. Appendix B gives the text and translation of an
                    extensive gospel lectionary colophon. Appendix C is a list of all known East
                    Syriac authors from 1500 to 1850.</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">The volume has many strong points. The author displays deep and
                    consistent knowledge of pre-modern East Syriac manuscripts. The value she places
                    on manuscript colophons as a source of social information is clear throughout
                    the volume. Also commendable is her ability to bring religious studies theory to
                    bear on the subject matter, whether considering the manuscripts or the scribes
                    that produced them. It is clear that the author has a mastery of the historical
                    background, especially relations with other religious communities. At the same
                    time, in addition to those broad brush strokes, she is intimately aware of the
                    details of where, when, how and by whom the manuscripts were produced. Masterful
                    too are her treatment of Syriac literary genres, including texts that cross
                    genres (protective texts come to mind) and her matter-of-fact yet sensitive way
                    of dealing with relations between the Church of the East and its Catholic
                    offshoot(s).</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">Overall, the book is a welcome addition to the rather sparse
                    selection of sources on the Church of the East after the Mongol era. Scholars
                    from a variety of academic fields – Syriac Studies, Islamic Studies, Ottoman
                    Studies, Middle Eastern Studies and Religious Studies – will want to have this
                    volume on their bookshelves.</p>

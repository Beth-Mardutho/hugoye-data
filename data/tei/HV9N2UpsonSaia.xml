         <div type="abstract">
            <p>Syriac Dialogue hymns have been an
    important part of East- and West-Syriac liturgy since at least
    the middle of the fifth century CE. The hymns perform a
    distinctive method of biblical
    interpretation—“freeze-frame”
    exegesis—that expands biblical narratives in order to
    garner scriptural support for contemporary Christological
    positions. While providing useful theological training,
    however, the hymns convey several compromised portrayals of
    biblical protagonists, which are striking when compared with
    Greek and Latin treatments of the same figures.</p>

         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P1"/>[1] Much of
    the recent scholarship on ancient biblical interpretation has
    focused on the variety of figurative exegetical methods. Such
    projects have endeavored to problematize the traditional
    polarization between Antiochene typology and Alexandrian
    allegory, and rather to shift scholars’ focus to
    educational practices that formed both readers and reading
    methods, as well as the social, political, and religious
    functions of various exegetical practices.<note place="foot" xml:id="#FN1" n="1">
                    <p rend="footnote text">
             For example, see F. Young, <hi rend="italic">Biblical Exegesis
    and the Formation of Christian Culture</hi> (Peabody, MA:
    Hendrickson, 2002); D. Dawson, <hi rend="italic">Allegorical Readers and
    Cultural Revision in Ancient Alexandria</hi> (Berkeley:
    University of California Press, 1992). 
         </p>
                </note> In the quest to
    rethink the figurative exegesis of Latin and Greek
    Christianity, scholars have not paid enough attention to the
    exegetical approaches of Syriac Christians. The most obvious
    reason for this disregard is language; until recently, much of
    the Syriac Christian corpus has remained untranslated,
    hindering scholars’ access to and analysis of the
    material. A closer examination of exegetical methods from this
    tradition, however, further complexifies the categories of
    biblical interpretation in late antiquity and provides a
    fruitful avenue for further research.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P2"/>[2] In this
    paper, I will look at a distinctive form of interpretation
    found in the Syriac Dialogue hymns. These hymns, which were
    incorporated into Syriac liturgy from the early fourth century
    to the present day, utilized a method of exegesis that expanded
    biblical narratives, filling in gaps when the biblical stories
    were imprecise or ambiguous, in order to limit alternative
    “unorthodox” interpretations. The authors of Syriac
    Dialogue hymns fused an exegetical technique akin to Jewish
    narrative <hi rend="italic">aggadah</hi> with a Mesopotamian dialogue genre
    in order to devise a hymn form that could entertain as well as
    instruct Syriac congregations on a number of contemporary
    theological issues. In what follows, I will describe the method
    of exegesis employed by Syriac Dialogue authors, the pedagogic
    function of these hymns, and their unusual treatment of certain
    biblical protagonists.</p>

    Biblical Narratives</head>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P3"/>[3] There
    are over forty extant Dialogue hymns surviving in at least one
    Syriac church (the Syrian Orthodox, the Maronite, and/or the
    Church of the East).<note place="foot" xml:id="#FN2" n="2">

    Edition,” <hi rend="italic">Le Muséon</hi> 97 (1984):
    29–58. Although the much-anticipated American collection
    of the Dialogue hymns has been delayed, individual
    hymns—in Syriac and English translations—can be
    located in the following publications. Sebastian Brock has
    published fourteen individual Dialogue hymns in a Syriac

    Mary have been published in R. Beshara, <hi rend="italic">Mary: Ship of
    Treasures</hi> (Lebanon: Diocese of Saint Maron, 1988),
    65–67, 83–93 and in S. Brock, <hi rend="italic">Bride of Light:
    Hymns on Mary from the Syriac Churches</hi> (Kottayam: SEERI,
    1994), 111–134; English translations of four Dialogue
    hymns can be found in S. Brock, <hi rend="italic">Sogiatha: Syriac Dialogue
    Hymns</hi> (Kottayam: St. Joseph’s Press, 1987). For an
    English translation and commentary on the <hi rend="italic">Dialogue between

    Dialogue’—An Example from the Past,”

    57–70. 
         </p>
                </note> These hymns, which have been included in
    Syriac liturgy since the fourth century, share a common
    structure and format.<note place="foot" xml:id="#FN3" n="3">
                    <p rend="footnote text">
             Although the manuscript evidence dates to the
    eighth and ninth centuries at the earliest, internal evidence
    demonstrates a much earlier date of origin for this genre in
    Syriac literature. Sebastian Brock argues that the Dialogues
    were already adapted from Mesopotamian Precedence Disputes into
    a distinctive, Syriac genre by the time of Ephrem, whom he sees
    drawing freely upon the stylized form in his <hi rend="italic">madrashe</hi>.
    Both East- and West-Syriac traditions also share several
    <hi rend="italic">sogyatha</hi> in their liturgy, which points to a date of
    origin before their split. Moreover, the phrasing of certain
    theological concepts also indicates an early date. For example,
    several hymns commonly write that Jesus “clothed
    himself” or “put on” a body (<hi rend="italic">lbeš
    pagrâ</hi>), which would later be an unusual and
    imprecise way to describe the incarnation. Brock, therefore,
    estimates a common literary production of early Syriac Dialogue
    hymns among the East- and West-Syriac churches around the
    beginning of the fifth century, though the exegetical form is
    evidenced already in the fourth century by Ephrem. Brock,
    “Syriac Dialogue Poems: Marginalia,” 35–6.
    
         </p>
                </note> Each hymn is focused on a dialogue or
    debate between two main characters. After a brief introduction,
    the pair alternate arguments in support of their side of an
    issue. At the end of the debate, a winner is pronounced.
    Structurally, Syriac Dialogue hymns follow a 7 + 7 couplet
    meter<note place="foot" xml:id="#FN4" n="4">
                    <p rend="footnote text">
             In a few cases there is slight variation on this
    typical meter. For instance, the <hi rend="italic">Dialogue between Joseph
    and Benjamin</hi> has a 6 + 6, 6 + 6 meter, the <hi rend="italic">Dialogue
    between Mary and the Gardner</hi> an 8 + 8, 8 + 8 meter, and
    Ephrem’s <hi rend="italic">Dialogue between Death and Satan</hi> has a
    7 + 4, 7 + 4 meter. Brock, “Syriac Dialogue Poems:
    Marginalia,” 42, 48, 54.

                    <p rend="footnote text">
             The acrostic often commences after the introductory
    material at the beginning of the debate. Eight of the
    twenty-six hymns, however, have no alphabetic acrostic. See
    Sebastian Brock’s useful chart of the structural
    characteristics of each hymn in S. Brock, “Syriac Dispute
    Poems: The Various Types,” in <hi rend="italic">Dispute Poems and
    Dialogues in the Ancient and Mediaeval Near East: Forms and

         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P4"/>[4] The
    debate format and certain structural characteristics common to
    the Syriac Dialogue hymns were borrowed from the Mesopotamian
    Precedence Dispute genre, which typically involved a debate
    between two personifications who vied for superiority (e.g.,
    Summer and Winter, Silver and Copper, Pickaxe and
    Plough).<note place="foot" xml:id="#FN7" n="7">
                    <p rend="footnote text">

    Precedence Disputes see R. Murray, “Aramaic and Syriac
    Dispute-Poems and their Connections,” in <hi rend="italic">Studia
    Aramaica: New Sources and New Approaches</hi>, ed. M. J.
    Geller, J. C. Greenfield, and M. P. Weitzman (Oxford: Oxford
    University Press, 1995), 160; and S. Brock, “The Dispute
    Poem: From Sumer To Syriac,” <hi rend="italic">Journal of Canadian
    Society for Syriac Studies</hi> 1 (2001): 3–10. 
         </p>
                </note> Early Syriac Dialogues demonstrate the most
    affinity to the Mesopotamian genre. That is, the characters
    were personifications (e.g., <hi rend="italic">Dialogue between the Church
    and Synagogue</hi>) and they disputed who was greater (e.g.,
    <hi rend="italic">Dialogue between the Two Thieves</hi>). Later Syriac
    Dialogues, however, began to transform the genre. These
    Dialogue authors co-opted the context of dispute from the
    Mesopotamian genre, but replaced the disputants with biblical
    characters. Furthermore, these characters took opposing sides
    of an issue rather than debating which of them was greater.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P5"/>[5] In an
    attempt to fuse the Mesopotamian genre with biblical
    narratives, Syriac Dialogue authors expanded the biblical texts
    in a manner that paralleled the Jewish exegetical technique of
    narrative <hi rend="italic">aggadah</hi>.<note place="foot" xml:id="#FN8" n="8">

             I do not mean to imply that <hi rend="italic">aggadic</hi>

             The use of Jewish <hi rend="italic">aggadot</hi> in Greek
    and Latin Christian literature has long been a topic of
    interest to scholars of Patristics. Most scholars have been
    concerned with the points of contact between Jewish and
    Christian interpretations, but very few have been concerned
    with shared exegetical methods. Adam Kamesar’s article is
    the notable exception. Kamesar has argued that
    Alexandrian-Palestinian Christians used Jewish <hi rend="italic">aggadot</hi>
    for historical knowledge or background information (as a part
    of “historical” exegesis), while Antiochene
    exegetes were more skeptical of the historical validity of the
    <hi rend="italic">aggadic</hi> expansions. See A. Kamesar, “The
    evaluation of the narrative aggada in Greek and Latin patristic
    literature,” <hi rend="italic">Journal of Theological Studies</hi> 45.1

    Dialogue authors combined the Mesopotamian genre with expanded
    readings of the biblical stories to develop a distinctive form
    of biblical interpretation. Although multiple authors composed
    Syriac Dialogue hymns over a large span of years, a consistent
    exegetical method is employed in nearly every hymn. Syriac
    Dialogue authors typically utilized what I will call the
    “freeze-frame” approach to biblical
    narratives.<note place="foot" xml:id="#FN15" n="15">

                </note> After introducing the setting of a particular
    biblical story at the beginning of the hymn (often following
    the <hi rend="italic">Peshitta</hi> quite closely), the author would freeze
    the biblical story and expand that frame to fill in a more
    detailed conversation between two biblical characters. A
    question or doubt raised by a character in the biblical
    narrative often provided the starting point of the
    “freeze-frame” section since such expressions were
    easily expanded into a larger debate or dialogue. At the end of
    the hymn, the author pronounced an official ruling on the issue
    discussed and then resumed where the biblical narrative left
    off.</p>

    There are a number of slight variations from this typical
    “freeze-frame” pattern. In some Syriac Dialogue
    hymns the “freeze-frame” is not an expansion of a
    biblical verse, but rather an addition of a missing scene. For
    instance, one Dialogue hymn describes a conversation between
    Mary and the Magi who came to worship the newborn Jesus. In the
    canonical texts there is no recorded dialogue between the Magi
    and Mary and/or Joseph. It must be assumed by readers/hearers
    of the biblical stories though that when the Magi were
    presenting their gifts to Jesus they conversed with his
    parents. From this assumption, the Dialogue author fills in a
    scene that was absent from the biblical record.<note place="foot" xml:id="#FN23" n="23">

    Despite these slight variations in the
    “freeze-frame” approach, the majority of Syriac
    Dialogue authors consistently expanded the biblical narrative,
    opening up the stories to create a space for theological
    musing. In this way, Syriac Dialogue authors did not simply
    comment on the biblical narratives but rather placed their
    expansions and interpretations into the voices of the original
    biblical characters. These interpretations, therefore, appeared
    to have been sanctioned by the characters themselves, eliding
    the exegetical work of the authors. Additionally, since the
    hymns were sung and heard—rather than read—the line
    between what was originally in the biblical stories and what
    was added became blurred and the Dialogue authors’
    interpretations were legitimated as they were seamlessly
    interwoven into the canonical text. This use of biblical
    material is particularly successful because the new story
    contains “echoes of the old story.”<note place="foot" xml:id="#FN36" n="36">
                    <p rend="footnote text">
             David Dawson discusses a similar mode of
    “interpretation as composition” with regard to
    Valentinian allegory. He argues that the author of a revised
    biblical narrative “garners the unwitting sympathy, and
    perhaps even support, of readers who, were they to see how
    seriously their former favorite story had been undermined,
    displaced, or absorbed, might otherwise be shocked at the
    interpreter’s audacity.” See Dawson,
    <hi rend="italic">Allegorical Readers and Cultural Revision</hi>,

         </p>
                </note> Hearers of the
    hymns, who recognize the familiar story, are predisposed to
    receiving these new versions, possibly unaware of how—or

            <anchor corresp="P14"/>[14] The
    Syriac Dialogues thus created—and perpetuated through
    regular, liturgical performance—new biblical traditions

    Syriac Dialogue authors were not unique in this endeavor. It
    was not uncommon for Greek and Latin commentators to clarify
    ambiguous passages of scripture, in many instances, taking
    liberty to describe the intentions, rationale, and hidden
    thoughts of biblical protagonists. For instance, David Dawson
    has demonstrated how Valentinus inserted his biblical
    interpretations into new compositions that “did not
    distinguish quoted or borrowed material from what he
    create[d]... Instead he absorbed his sources almost entirely
    into his own imaginative compositions.”<note place="foot" xml:id="#FN37" n="37">

            <anchor corresp="P16"/>[16] The
    Dialogue hymns were a site of flexibility within a relatively
    stable textual tradition. It was here that interpreters could
    alter, add, or leave out portions of the biblical narratives to
    retell the story in a way that benefited their theological
    agendas. This method of expansion was attractive to Syriac
    authors because it provided not only a space for debate of
    pressing theological issues, but also biblical justification to
    support one side of the debate. When the biblical narratives
    were ambiguous, contradictory, or worse yet, silent on their
    contemporary issues, the Dialogue authors found a way to open
    up the canonical narratives so as to buttress their stance on a
    contemporary theological issue.<note place="foot" xml:id="#FN39" n="39">

    After reading the Syriac Dialogue hymns, their important
    pedagogical function becomes immediately clear. The biblical
    characters in the hymns were made to discuss in detail aspects
    of Christology (e.g., the nature of Christ, his incarnation,
    and his salvific resurrection),<note place="foot" xml:id="#FN40" n="40">

    Dialogue hymns were sung at important times of the liturgical

             Note that this Dialogue hymn conflates the

    “Paradise.” The author, therefore, assumed that the
    cherub who was commissioned to guard the garden paradise after
    the expulsion of Adam and Eve (Gen 3:24) would be the same
    cherub to admit Christians into the heavenly paradise. See S.

                </note> As the
    lines of the dialoguing characters were sung, the singers
    literally took on the voices of the characters, allowing them
    to enter thoroughly into the debates. In other words, the
    church service became one (if not the only) sanctioned site to
    debate the theological issues of the day. Although the singing
    of the Dialogue hymns allowed for the embodied expressions of
    various theological positions, the authors of the Dialogue
    hymns (and the church leaders who sanctioned their performance
    in the liturgy) in the end approved only one authoritative
    stance. The final pronouncement on the issue found at the end
    of each hymn left no room for church members to deviate. Just
    as the singers embodied the debate, so too they gave voice to
    the “orthodox” judgment ultimately endorsed by each
    hymn. Congregations, therefore, were instructed on church
    doctrine by embodying the doctrine itself through the
    performance of the hymns.</p>

            <anchor corresp="P21"/>[21]
    Additionally, the congregation members who were not part of the
    alternating choirs participated in community refrains (many of
    which were shared among various hymns). These refrains were
    interspersed between the stanzas and played a role in policing
    congregants to come down on the “proper” side of
    the issue. For instance, three Dialogue hymns shared the
    following refrain:</p>
         <quote>
      Praise to You, Lord for at Your coming<lb/>
      sinners turned from their wickedness and<lb/>
      entered into the protection of Eden’s Garden,<lb/>

            <lb/>
         </quote>
         <p>By the end of each hymn, the congregants would know which
    side of the issues constituted “wickedness” (e.g.,
    improper opinions regarding Jesus’ conception and
    incarnation) and likely monitored themselves to “turn
    from” such opinions.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P22"/>[22]
    Since the hymns were sung side by side with biblical readings,
    congregants were taught not only how to think about theological
    issues of their day but also how to interpret biblical stories
    in an “orthodox” manner. The hymns
    clarified—by limiting—the meaning or significance
    that could be extracted from the canonical stories. By pairing
    the biblical narrative with an authorized interpretation (in
    hymn form) the congregation was given the tools to interpret
    the biblical narratives “properly.”</p>

         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P23"/>[23] It
    is clear that composers of Syriac Dialogue hymns were chiefly
    concerned with imparting proper theological instruction to
    their congregants; the form and performance of such hymns were
    well thought out and organized to create such an effect. The
    hymns’ unqualified focus on presenting
    “orthodox” theology (particularly Christology),
    however, generated an interesting by-product concerning the
    depiction of biblical protagonists. Both the framework of
    expansion, which was launched from biblical protagonists’
    doubts and questions, and the concern to detail Christological
    disputes (e.g., the nature of Christ, his incarnation, and his
    salvific resurrection) overshadowed the desire to protect the
    reputation of some of the Bible’s most beloved
    characters. While many Greek and Latin interpreters strove to
    protect the reputations of their beloved forefathers, this
    concern was deprioritized in the Syriac Dialogue hymns.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P24"/>[24] With
    the goal to expand biblical scenes into more detailed
    theological discussions, the Syriac Dialogue hymns used the
    questions and doubts of biblical characters as starting points.
    These blemishes or momentary lapses of character noted in the
    biblical narratives were amplified in the Syriac Dialogues and
    served as a frame to initiate a discussion, as well as to keep
    it going. For instance, in the Lukan version of John the
    Baptist’s miraculous conception, readers will notice that
    Zechariah hesitates to accept the angel’s message, and
    questions the angel’s prophesy only once.<note place="foot" xml:id="#FN51" n="51">

         </p>
                </note> In the Syriac

    again.<note place="foot" xml:id="#FN52" n="52">

         </p>
                </note> This repeated contention is a narrative
    strategy that creates a space for the angel to explain in
    detail how and why God would enact the miraculous birth. This
    portrayal, however, runs the risk of depicting Zechariah as
    ignorant or dim-witted in order to allow room for instruction
    on the incarnation. In fact, by the end of the hymn, the singer
    or hearer might be more apt to agree that the angel’s
    punishment for Zechariah’s unbelief—striking him
    dumb until the birth of the child—is warranted much more
    so than a reader or hearer of the biblical text.</p>

    Likewise, in the <hi rend="italic">Dialogue between John the Baptist and
    Jesus</hi>, John’s repeated protests (when asked to
    baptize Jesus) frame the movements of the Dialogue. Each of
    John’s refusals allows a space in the hymn for additional
    theological arguments; the character Jesus is thus able to
    discuss the necessity of being baptized, the necessity of being
    baptized by a human rather than a heavenly creature, and the
    paradoxical ability of a divine being to be enclosed by a
    material river.<note place="foot" xml:id="#FN53" n="53">

         </p>
                </note> John’s refusals keep the Dialogue going

    make John vulnerable to being perceived as both stubborn and
    ignorant.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P26"/>[26] It
    is clear that Dialogue authors used the human flaws of biblical
    characters as a narrative strategy that both launched the
    Dialogues and kept the debates alive. The authors seemed
    unconcerned with how this technique might compromise the
    reputations of certain biblical characters. Moreover, the
    singers or hearers of the hymns might not have been offended by
    such depictions, considering them to be merely reflections of
    these characters’ humanity. This lack of concern to
    protect biblical characters at all costs from the
    <hi rend="italic">appearance</hi> of vulnerability, however, is striking in
    comparison with Greek and Latin Christian exegesis.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P27"/>[27]
    Unlike the authors of the Dialogue hymns, many Greek and Latin
    commentators went to great lengths to sanitize their biblical
    protagonists’ reputations. These commentators regularly
    explained away or justified the indiscretions of the beloved
    forefathers that might have been unsavory to both Christians
    and Christian adversaries.<note place="foot" xml:id="#FN54" n="54">
                    <p rend="footnote text">
             For example, in response to Faustus’
    claim that Abraham impatiently and lustfully pursued his
    servant Hagar when his wife Sara failed to conceive, Augustine
    launched a three-pronged defense. First, he claimed that
    Abraham did not indulge his bodily appetite irrationally, but
    rather under the guidance of reason, with divinely-instituted
    procreation as his goal. Second, Augustine cites 1 Corinthians
    7:4, to demonstrate that Abraham’s actions were
    consistent with marital obedience to his wife’s (also
    highly-rational) desire for children. Third, Augustine pays
    careful attention to the sequence of events in the biblical
    narrative to show that God had not yet told Abraham from whom
    his countless descendents would derive. (Augustine, <hi rend="italic">Against
    Faustus</hi> 22.1–59). Likewise, to defend
    Abraham’s willingness to commit patricide, many
    commentators portray Isaac as a willing victim. (1 Clement
    31:2–4; Philo, <hi rend="italic">On Abraham</hi> 172) Additionally,
    when confronted with Jacob’s double-deception of his
    brother Esau, commentators creatively read Genesis to claim
    that Esau willingly gave up his birthright, and that
    Isaac’s blindness was God’s way of ensuring that
    Jacob received the blessing. (Ephrem, <hi rend="italic">Commentary on
    Genesis</hi> 23:2; 25:2; Philo, <hi rend="italic">Questions on Genesis</hi>

                </note> The difference between these two
    sorts of exegesis might be prompted by the kinds of theological
    issues—and opponents—that were most pressing on the
    different Christian communities. On the one hand, the
    Marcionite and Manichaean opponents of Tertullian and Augustine
    advanced theological arguments that directly implicated
    particular biblical figures (particularly the patriarchs). For
    example, in order to invalidate the God of the Israelites,
    Marcionites attacked key figures of the Hebrew Bible. In
    response, Christians like Tertullian spent a great deal of
    energy interpreting the biblical narratives in such a way as to
    exonerate these major characters.<note place="foot" xml:id="#FN55" n="55">
                    <p rend="footnote text">
             For example, when Marcionites accused Moses

    Tertullian immediately defends him, maintaining that Moses

    of healing. Tertullian, <hi rend="italic">Against Marcion</hi> 2.22. 
         </p>
                </note> On the other hand, the
    range of theological issues addressed in the Syriac Dialogue
    hymns tended to focus on the Christological controversies
    surrounding the person and nature of Christ. This different
    focus might account for the disregard of Syriac Dialogue
    authors to preserve and protect the character of other key
    biblical protagonists; they need not protect characters that
    were not under attack. Thus, the need to define precisely the
    character and nature of Jesus, the central figure under
    dispute, overshadowed all others. As a result, Syriac Dialogue
    authors fearlessly expanded upon the blemishes of other
    biblical protagonists in order to stabilize important points of
    Christology.<note place="foot" xml:id="#FN56" n="56">

    as I argue, Syriac Dialogue authors strove to protect disputed

    conversation partner in four of the Dialogue hymns and in each
    one, although she may express doubt or hesitation, her doubts
    are consistently legitimated to protect her from negative

    understanding. (Although modern readers may cringe at what now
    appears to be a negative depiction of Mary’s
    intelligence, in the hymn, this gendered excuse guards her from
    seeming to lack faith.) Thus, Mary’s questions are not
    cast in terms of antagonism, but rather in terms of her
    inability to understand such magnificent claims; she says,

    Angel. By portraying Mary as guarding a secret the author
    protects her from seeming ignorant. On the contrary, Mary gains
    the upper hand by revealing to the Magi another secret that was

    the end, it appears that protecting Mary’s reputation is
    more important than preserving the integrity of her male
    counterparts. She is the only biblical figure, aside from
    Jesus, to require such safeguards. This attention to Mary
    confirms the vital role she played in Syriac Christianity.
    Since she was implicated so strongly in Christological issues,
    such as the conception and incarnation of Christ, her character
    deserved as much protection as her son’s.</p>

         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P32"/>[32] The
    Syriac Dialogue hymns are an important genre within the
    Christian literature of late antiquity. The authors of these
    hymns creatively interwove the Mesopotamian Dispute genre with
    an expanded reading of biblical narratives to craft a hymn form
    that entertained as well as instructed. Driven by current
    theological debate, they guided certain
    interpretations—and excluded others—through an
    expansion of biblical narratives. In this way, they also shored
    biblical support for their theological positions by putting
    their interpretations back into the mouths of revered biblical
    characters. Since their new interpretations were fixed within
    the liturgy of the Syrian churches (both East and West), they
    taught congregants how to think about certain theological
    issues, as well as how to interpret the Bible properly,
    creating a seamless unity between the biblical narratives and
    their interpretations of those narratives. An understanding of
    this distinctive exegetical method will hopefully point
    scholars to similar methods that can be located in Greek and
    Latin homilies and biblical commentaries.</p>_______<lb/>

             Although the manuscript evidence dates to the
    eighth and ninth centuries at the earliest, internal evidence
    demonstrates a much earlier date of origin for this genre in
    Syriac literature. Sebastian Brock argues that the Dialogues
    were already adapted from Mesopotamian Precedence Disputes into
    a distinctive, Syriac genre by the time of Ephrem, whom he sees
    drawing freely upon the stylized form in his <hi rend="italic">madrashe</hi>.
    Both East- and West-Syriac traditions also share several
    <hi rend="italic">sogyatha</hi> in their liturgy, which points to a date of
    origin before their split. Moreover, the phrasing of certain
    theological concepts also indicates an early date. For example,
    several hymns commonly write that Jesus “clothed
    himself” or “put on” a body (<hi rend="italic">lbeš
    pagrâ</hi>), which would later be an unusual and
    imprecise way to describe the incarnation. Brock, therefore,
    estimates a common literary production of early Syriac Dialogue
    hymns among the East- and West-Syriac churches around the
    beginning of the fifth century, though the exegetical form is
    evidenced already in the fourth century by Ephrem. Brock,
    “Syriac Dialogue Poems: Marginalia,” 35–6.

             In a few cases there is slight variation on this
    typical meter. For instance, the <hi rend="italic">Dialogue between Joseph
    and Benjamin</hi> has a 6 + 6, 6 + 6 meter, the <hi rend="italic">Dialogue
    between Mary and the Gardner</hi> an 8 + 8, 8 + 8 meter, and
    Ephrem’s <hi rend="italic">Dialogue between Death and Satan</hi> has a
    7 + 4, 7 + 4 meter. Brock, “Syriac Dialogue Poems:
    Marginalia,” 42, 48, 54. <ref target="#FNRef4">

         <p>
             The acrostic often commences after the introductory
    material at the beginning of the debate. Eight of the
    twenty-six hymns, however, have no alphabetic acrostic. See

    characteristics of each hymn in S. Brock, “Syriac Dispute

             The use of Jewish <hi rend="italic">aggadot</hi> in Greek
    and Latin Christian literature has long been a topic of
    interest to scholars of Patristics. Most scholars have been
    concerned with the points of contact between Jewish and
    Christian interpretations, but very few have been concerned
    with shared exegetical methods. Adam Kamesar’s article is
    the notable exception. Kamesar has argued that
    Alexandrian-Palestinian Christians used Jewish <hi rend="italic">aggadot</hi>
    for historical knowledge or background information (as a part
    of “historical” exegesis), while Antiochene
    exegetes were more skeptical of the historical validity of the
    <hi rend="italic">aggadic</hi> expansions. See A. Kamesar, “The
    evaluation of the narrative aggada in Greek and Latin patristic
    literature,” <hi rend="italic">Journal of Theological Studies</hi> 45.1

             Mary appeals to Eve as proof that humans can
    come into existence without intercourse, while also claiming
    the uniqueness of her Son and, therefore, the lack of need for

             David Dawson discusses a similar mode of
    “interpretation as composition” with regard to
    Valentinian allegory. He argues that the author of a revised
    biblical narrative “garners the unwitting sympathy, and
    perhaps even support, of readers who, were they to see how
    seriously their former favorite story had been undermined,
    displaced, or absorbed, might otherwise be shocked at the
    interpreter’s audacity.” See Dawson,

             Note that this Dialogue hymn conflates the
    Garden of Eden and Heaven, considering both to be the same
    “Paradise.” The author, therefore, assumed that the
    cherub who was commissioned to guard the garden paradise after
    the expulsion of Adam and Eve (Gen 3:24) would be the same
    cherub to admit Christians into the heavenly paradise. See S.

             For example, in response to Faustus’
    claim that Abraham impatiently and lustfully pursued his
    servant Hagar when his wife Sara failed to conceive, Augustine
    launched a three-pronged defense. First, he claimed that
    Abraham did not indulge his bodily appetite irrationally, but
    rather under the guidance of reason, with divinely-instituted
    procreation as his goal. Second, Augustine cites 1 Corinthians
    7:4, to demonstrate that Abraham’s actions were
    consistent with marital obedience to his wife’s (also
    highly-rational) desire for children. Third, Augustine pays
    careful attention to the sequence of events in the biblical
    narrative to show that God had not yet told Abraham from whom
    his countless descendents would derive. (Augustine, <hi rend="italic">Against
    Faustus</hi> 22.1–59). Likewise, to defend
    Abraham’s willingness to commit patricide, many
    commentators portray Isaac as a willing victim. (1 Clement
    31:2–4; Philo, <hi rend="italic">On Abraham</hi> 172) Additionally,
    when confronted with Jacob’s double-deception of his
    brother Esau, commentators creatively read Genesis to claim
    that Esau willingly gave up his birthright, and that
    Isaac’s blindness was God’s way of ensuring that
    Jacob received the blessing. (Ephrem, <hi rend="italic">Commentary on
    Genesis</hi> 23:2; 25:2; Philo, <hi rend="italic">Questions on Genesis</hi>
    4:196) With regard to the patriarchs’ sexual
    indiscretions, see E. Clark, “Contesting Abraham: The

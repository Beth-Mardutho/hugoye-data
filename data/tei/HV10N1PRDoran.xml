            <anchor corresp="P1"/>[1] Susan
    Harvey has given us a masterful treatment of the role of the
    sense of smell in Late Antiquity. To change the sensory image,
    it is a rich, generous platter. She alerts us to the way smells
    filled the late antique air and provides a fascinating insight
    into how the Constantinian revolution changed Christian
    attitudes towards perfumes and incense. She also conveys how,
    for the late antique Christian, the bodily life of Jesus meant
    that the senses would be involved in experiencing God’s
    kingdom.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P2"/>[2] In the
    first chapter, “The Olfactory World,” Harvey
    describes how Greeks and Romans breathed an air filled with
    scents and smells. Complex and pungent aromas attended
    sacrifices. Aromatics were in daily use: as pesticides to drive
    away insects and snakes, as air fresheners in the smelly
    environment of an ancient city, as counteracting bodily odors.
    They could be used for medicinal purposes or as poisons. Hence
    good smells were associated with good things, bad smells with
    bad. Here Harvey notes that Christians had critiqued pagan
    sacrifices before the full impact of the Constantinian
    revolution as had Greco-Roman philosophers; nevertheless they
    had  used sacrificial rhetoric to describe Christian
    liturgical usage.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P3"/>[3] In the
    second chapter, “The Christian Body: Ritually Fashioned
    Experience,” Harvey emphasizes the importance of the
    Constantinian change for the Christian use of aromatics.
    Christians now had a place and status in the world. The
    increasing number of Christian churches and their public
    liturgy meant that a ritual context was given as the place to
    learn sensory meanings, to distinguish good from bad smells.
    Holy oil was a component of Christian initiation and perfumed
    oil used for the baptized. There was a growing use of spices in
    oils, and liturgical perfume was seen as a sign of the presence
    of the divine. Harvey is excellent in tracing the role incense
    begins to play in ritual piety, expressly as evidence in Ephrem
    and the <hi rend="italic">Transitus Mariae.</hi> Excluded from Christian
    ritual for 300 years, incense contained both sacrificial
    symbolism as well as indicating the divine-human relationship.
    Unseen and yet experienced, smells wafting through the air
    connected the source to the one sensing. “Knowledge of
    God was instilled in the believer who inhaled the scent of
    worship.” (p. 80)</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P4"/>[4] Chapter
    3, “Olfaction and Christian Knowing,” is a treasure
    trove of ways in which olfaction was used as a powerful
    theological metaphor. The <hi rend="italic">Song of Songs</hi> with its rich
    sensual imagery gave a strong impulse to such use. A
    particularly beautiful example is where Ambrose of Milan calls
    Christ the flower of Mary. Just as the flower does not lose its
    odor when cut, torn or bruised, so Jesus on the cross exhaled
    the gift of eternal life. Besides such use, odor could be used
    diagnostically, as each person has their own individual smell.
    Divine visitation could fill a holy person with its fragrance,
    and this fragrance could then become known to those who visited
    the holy one. Harvey also mines the liturgical commentaries and
    her analysis of the consecration of the holy myron is
    superb.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P5"/>[5] Chapter
    4, to this reader, reveals the key problem that drives this
    work: How to reconcile the seemingly contradictory
    post-Constantinian developments of a more complex sensory
    ritual life for Christians and of a rising severity in
    asceticism? Harvey sees both these as responses to a
    “heightened importance of the physical realm”
    (p.156). She finds a reconciliation in the notion of the
    fragrance of virtue, and the way lives of ascetics are
    connected to ritual activity through olfactory images. The
    prime examples for her are the stylite saints: Stylite
    asceticism and incense piety point to a profound reconciliation
    between ascetic and liturgical discourses in late antiquity.
    She captures the late antique view that the foul smells
    surrounding sickness and death were a sign of humanity’s
    fallen condition, and wonderfully explores how the foul stench
    surrounding Simeon the Stylite’s ascetic endeavors could
    be transformed at his death into a paradisial fragrance. While
    her analysis works wonderfully well for the Eastern tradition,
    I would have liked her to suggest how this might apply in the
    Western tradition. While Martin of Tours once smelled the
    presence of the devil and Jerome has the body of Hilarion give
    off fragrance at his death, the life of Benedict contains no
    sensory images. Does this reflect a different view of ascetic
    endeavor, or perhaps a different attitude towards liturgy? Is
    Western liturgy more sight and sound than smell?</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P6"/>[6] Harvey
    ends her work with a fascinating contrast between
    Augustine’s description of heaven, based primarily on
    sight, and Ephrem’s, strongly based on olfactory
    experience. For Harvey, sense perception is a mode of religious
    knowing, and for Ephrem it is “the foundational
    experience of the human-divine encounter both in the present
    and in the life to come.” (p.238) With its insistence
    that we be alert to our senses and to our bodily existence,
    this book contributes to the ongoing discussion about the body
    and religion. It is a treat to read.</p>

    Professor Taeke Jansma died on May 30, 2007 in Voorschoten,
    near Leiden, The Netherlands, at the age of 87. Present-day
    Syriac scholars will not have seen new publications by
    Professor Jansma in the last thirty years or so, but several of
    his Syriac publications that appeared between 1949 and the
    mid-seventies have proven to be of such lasting significance
    that there is reason, in a journal devoted to Syriac studies,
    to reflect briefly on the work of this eminent scholar.<note place="foot" xml:id="FN1" n="1">

    Jansma was born in Almelo, in the province of Overijssel, in
    the east of The Netherlands, in 1919. In 1938, he went to
    Leiden to study theology and Semitics. Under the supervision of
    Professor P.A.H. de Boer (d. 1989) he wrote his dissertation,
    <hi rend="italic">Inquiry into the Hebrew Text and the Ancient Versions of
    Zechariah IX-XIV</hi> (no. 1), with which he earned his Ph.D. in
    1949. Chapters are devoted to the Targum, the Peshitta, and the
    Septuagint, while Syriac readings are used and referred to
    throughout the dissertation. Moreover, several of the
    additional theses, short statements that in the Dutch tradition
    accompany the dissertation, deal with Syriac. Already during
    his student years, therefore, Syriac must have been emerging as
    an important focus of his scholarly interests. Jansma acquired
    additional expertise in the Aramaic languages of Late Antiquity
    including Syriac, Jewish Aramaic, and Samaritan Aramaic during
    a period of study spent in Leeds and Oxford in 1949-50.</p>
         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P3"/>[3] In 1950,
    Leiden University appointed him full professor of “Hebrew
    language and literature, Israelite Antiquities, and Aramaic”,
    thus putting on his shoulder a heavy teaching load, which
    seemed to leave only a little room for Syriac. For nearly a
    quarter of a century Jansma’s teaching covered the whole field
    that had been entrusted to him. Syllabi and student notes that
    continued to circulate in Leiden even many years after his
    retirement are a clear indication of the effect his teaching
    had on students. He was a powerful teacher, who was always
    extremely well prepared and who was able to capture the
    attention and stimulate the imagination of students.</p>
         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P4"/>[4] When in
    the late fifties the Peshitta project of the “International
    Organization for the Study of the Old Testament” was set up in
    Leiden, under the direction of Professor de Boer, Jansma took
    upon himself the preparation of the edition of Genesis (which
    appeared in 1977 – no. 6). There can be no doubt that he was
    well-equipped to carry out this task, but he saw his work as
    much more than that of a text-critic. As he wrote in his
    dissertation “… text-critical work only goes part of the way.
    It may find its completion by an exegetical study,” for
    “judging and weighing is the work of exegesis.” (p. 59). This
    must have been the background to his exploration, from the
    mid-fifties on, of Syriac interpretations of Genesis. This
    exploration led to a number of important publications that
    arose out of Jansma’s reading of numerous published and
    unpublished Syriac commentaries, treatises, and homilies.</p>
         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P5"/>[5] In 1958,
    Jansma published a paper of monograph length: “Investigations
    into the Early Syrian Fathers on Genesis. An Approach to the
    Exegesis of the Nestorian Church and to the Comparison of
    Nestorian and Jewish Exegesis,” (no. 8). This is a remarkable
    and still very useful survey of relevant Syriac texts, with
    comments on the characteristics of each text, on its sources,
    and on parallel passages drawn from Greek-Christian as well as
    from Jewish writings. This study laid the groundwork for much
    of the later scholarship in the field of East-Syriac biblical
    interpretation. Along with the work of Professor Van den Eynde
    in Louvain (d. 1991), who also in the fifties started his
    exemplary edition and annotated translation of
    Isho<hi rend="sup">c</hi>dad of Merv’s Old Testament commentaries,
    Jansma’s studies opened the field, identified the main texts,
    and formulated interesting research questions. Subsequent
    students and scholars owe a very great debt of gratitude to
    these two scholars, Jansma and Van den Eynde. They worked on
    the same texts, sometimes came to the same conclusions, and
    admired each other’s work. They also had in common, however,
    that they shunned public events and felt very uncomfortable
    with personal attention – which helps explain why they never
    met.</p>
         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P6"/>[6] Other
    important publications that emerged from Jansma’s work in the
    field of Syriac exegesis include his edition and study of
    Syriac fragments from Theodore of Mopsuestia’s Commentary on
    Genesis (no. 16), his study of interpretations of the Creation
    and Paradise story in Jacob of Serug (no. 9) and Narsai (nos.
    20, 23, 26, and 27), and his work on Ephrem’s Commentary on
    Genesis (nos. 28, 33, 38). Text-criticism and the history of
    interpretation are clearly interwoven in Jansma’s study of
    specific Genesis readings in the Syro-Hexapla (no. 25),
    Bardaisan (no. 24), Ephrem (no. 35), and Barhebraeus (no. 32).
    His study of a number of anonymous homilies (in particular nos.
    11 and 12) should be mentioned under this rubric as well.
    Jansma’s critical notes on the published texts and translations
    of Ephrem’s Commentaries on Genesis and Exodus (nos. 28, 31,
    33, and 38) as well as on Narsai’s Homilies on Creation (no.
    26) remain indispensable for those who study these texts
    today.</p>
         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P7"/>[7] In
    addition to the biblical text and its interpretation, the
    figure of Bardaisan and his legacy became an important theme in
    Jansma’s work. What was initially intended as a review of
    H.J.W. Drijvers’ monograph <hi rend="italic">Bardaisan of Edessa</hi> (1966)
    grew into a full monograph, which was published in Dutch in
    1969: <hi rend="italic">Natuur, lot en vrijheid. Bardesanes, de filosoof der
    Arameeërs en zijn images</hi> (no. 5). The most significant word
    of the title is the last one, “images.” Jansma strongly argued
    that the different sources providing information on Bardaisan
    and his teaching cannot be brought together into one coherent
    picture. We can hardly go beyond the different “images” which
    each of the sources create and construct. Present-day students,
    therefore, are like visitors in a gallery of paintings spanning
    nearly 18 centuries of history. We see, one after the other,
    portraits of Bardaisan, positive or negative, painted by such
    skilled artists as his disciple Filippus, Sextus Julius
    Africanus, Ephrem, … and in recent times, among others, by
    Schaeder, Levi della Vida, and Drijvers. Jansma himself clearly
    did not want to be one of these artists. With remarkable
    sharpness he tried to read each of the ancient sources in its
    own right, trying to understand what it was doing in its own
    context, and painfully aware (and “filled with unspeakable
    bitterness,” as the final sentence of the book has it) that the
    real Bardaisan escapes from us, that we know neither his
    writings nor his thoughts, and that we have not been able to
    glimpse his face.</p>
         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P8"/>[8] Jansma’s
    book on Bardaisan happened to be the very first monograph on a
    Syriac topic that I read as a beginning student of Syriac. The
    author’s erudition, which normally would be intimidating for an
    inexpert reader, is balanced with a very accessible and truly
    beautiful language and style. Moreover, the book is only very
    lightly footnoted. The reader is skillfully guided through the
    world of Edessene and Syriac Christian culture, and important
    lessons in literary and historical criticism are taught.</p>
         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P9"/>[9] A very
    different period of history is the scene of another of Jansma’s
    monographs, published in 1959: <hi rend="italic">Oost-Westelijke
    verkenningen</hi> (“East-West explorations” – no. 4). It is
    built on a parallel reading of two travelogues: the Latin
    report by William of Rubroeck of his journey to the Mongol
    court in 1253-1255, and the Syriac narrative of Barsauma’s
    travels to the Middle East and Europe at the end of the 13th
    century. Closely following the texts and explaining them to his
    readers in a lively fashion, Jansma delineates the ways in
    which the Flemish monk saw Mongolia and the East-Syrian prelate
    from the Beijing region saw Europe. The skills of the literary
    critic and of the historian, which would become so prominent in
    the Bardaisan book ten years later, are already to be found
    here. At the same time, this book shows the versatility of the
    author, who felt at home with any Syriac text between Bardaisan
    and Barhebraeus.</p>
         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P10"/>[10] In
    1973, the Leiden chair of Hebrew and Aramaic was split up.
    Jansma decided to leave the Hebrew part to a newly appointed
    colleague, and to become the first incumbent of the new Aramaic
    position himself. This could have been the beginning of a new
    phase in his career, one entirely devoted to teaching and
    research in the field of Aramaic and Syriac. Unfortunately,
    soon thereafter his health no longer allowed him to continue
    his work. He retired early, in his mid-fifties. Although he
    recovered to some extent, he did not resume academic work and
    chose not to participate in university life, in spite of his
    close physical proximity to it. This was a source of great
    sadness for his students and colleagues, who had to find
    consolation in their memories and in Jansma’s written work. His
    passing away now, more than thirty years later, at an advanced
    age, accentuates the pain of his early departure and long
    absence. However, in view of the rich diversity of his
    scholarship and its remarkable depth, our feelings should in
    the first place be ones of admiration and profound gratitude.
    May he rest in peace!</p>

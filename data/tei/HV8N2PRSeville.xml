         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P1"/>[1] This
    volume continues the long-standing Cistercian Studies
    Series’ tradition of translating monastic literature of
    all periods into English and joins a growing section dedicated
    to Syriac spirituality. Indeed it is an important
    contribution, allowing us a glimpse into one lesser known,
    pre-monastic strand of asceticism on the eastern fringe of the
    Roman Empire. The late fourth, early fifth century
    community to which this work was addressed is stratified into
    different levels of Christian behavior and observance. 
    The anonymous author focuses most of his attention on two of
    these levels, what the translators have termed “the
    Perfect” and “the Upright.” The Perfect
    ones have renounced all earthly desires and through following
    the great commandments (for example, to treat everyone better
    than oneself, to not judge others, to live free from care,
    etc.), mortifying their bodies, and practicing absolute poverty
    in the imitation of Christ, they have attained enlightenment
    and seek to educate other Christians. The second-tiered
    Upright have not overcome their struggle with material goods
    and thus lead a life engaged with worldly pursuits and work to
    minister to the physical needs of the Perfect.  Their
    spiritual disciplines include attempting to fulfill the moral
    and cultic rules found in the “inferior
    commandments” (i.e. the Ten Commandments) and the Golden
    Rule.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P2"/>[2]
    Kitchen’s extensive introduction begins by acquainting
    the reader with the general origins of Syriac
    Christianity. Emphasizing its ascetic flavor, he concisely
    describes the earliest Syriac literature, its use of vivid
    imagery and symbolism, and the unique practices that make
    Syriac Christianity distinct from its Mediterranean
    counterparts.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P3"/>[3] After a
    detailed examination of scholarship throughout the last century
    pertaining to the <hi rend="italic">Liber Graduum</hi> (with well-documented
    footnotes), the introduction proceeds to an overview of the
    structure of the work (or its lack thereof), brief descriptions
    of each <hi rend="italic">mēmrā</hi>, and general themes that
    connect the work together.  Highlights of this latter
    section are the translator’s discussions of the
    frequently overlooked “fledgling” or intermediate
    ascetic ranks, such as “the sick and the children,”
    and consideration of some of the pastoral problems of his
    community. For instance, tensions exist among the various
    levels concerning who merits material support, and external
    charges of elitism must be answered.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P4"/>[4] Kitchen
    rightly downplays the role of the <hi rend="italic">Liber Graduum</hi> in the
    Messalian controversy. Although historically several
    scholars had hoped that this was the missing <hi rend="italic">Asketikon</hi>
    of the Messalians, this claim could not be proven through its
    doctrinal content. The <hi rend="italic">Liber Graduum</hi> does
    demonstrate some Messalian tendencies, like the indwelling of
    demons, but never fully exhibits unorthodox beliefs. From what
    we know of the surviving descriptions of Messalian beliefs and
    practices, such as the total efficacy of unceasing prayer in
    contrast to the spiritual inefficacy of the visible Church and
    sacraments, these ideas are not supported by our anonymous
    author.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P5"/>[5] The
    translation has been made from Michael Kmosko’s edition
    found in <hi rend="italic">Patrologia Syriaca</hi> 3: Paris, 1926; the
    enumeration of the <hi rend="italic">mēmrē</hi> and the column
    numbers inserted into the translation follow this
    text. Kitchen and Parmentier present a fluid translation
    that is faithful to the spirit of the work overall, skillfully
    preserving the frank discussion of how these practices ought to
    be lived out and what the relationships among various
    Christians ought to be.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P6"/>[6] In
    addition to the introduction and translation, Kitchen and
    Parmentier have provided a bibliography of other modern
    translations of sections of the <hi rend="italic">Liber Graduum</hi>, several
    pages of studies covering the history of scholarship on this
    work, and a few brief listings on Syriac Christianity in
    general. There is also an index to the extensive
    scriptural references of the <hi rend="italic">Liber Graduum</hi> that has
    been extended to include some post- and extra-canonical
    writings and an index to proper names and places.  A
    subject index would be desirable for such a lengthy and
    thematically inter-connected work. But these materials
    along with the comprehensive introduction provide a solid entry
    point for anyone interested in Syriac Christianity, and the
    work as a whole offers scholars a valuable resource for the
    early development of the ascetic life in Syria.</p>

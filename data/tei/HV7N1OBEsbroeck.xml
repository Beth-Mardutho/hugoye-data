    Professor Michel van Esbroeck died in Louvain-la-Neuve,
    Belgium, on Friday morning, November 21, 2003, suddenly and
    prematurely. He just had come back from a trip to Rome, driving
    through the night, as was his wont. The news of his death
    reached his American colleagues and friends as they gathered in
    Atlanta, Georgia, for the annual meeting of the Society of
    Biblical Literature and the American Academy of Religion. It
    was received with disbelief and shock. Michel van Esbroeck was
    a truly remarkable scholar in the field of Eastern Christian
    studies. While the main focus of his work was on Georgian and
    Armenian Christian literature, his interest and competence
    covered other fields as well, and he had a number of fine
    publications in the field of Syriac.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P2"/>[2] Michel
    was born on June 17, 1934 in Malines (Mechelen), a Belgian town
    well known to Syriac scholars for the publication of
    Ephrem’s works by Thomas J. Lamy (Malines, 1882-1902).
    Michel often jokingly described himself as “flamand
    francophone” (“French speaking Flemish”),
    thus indicating the inadequacies of our linguistic and cultural
    categorizations. He himself was in fact a man of culture
    without borders, who did not fit into ready-made categories and
    who mastered an extraordinary number of languages, both ancient
    and modern.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P3"/>[3] He
    entered the Society of Jesus in 1953 and was ordained a
    Catholic priest in 1970. Since 1962 he was associated with the
    <hi rend="italic">Museum Bollandianum,</hi> the Brussels headquarters of the
    Bollandists, a group of Jesuit Fathers engaged in the scholarly
    study of Christian hagiography. In the early sixties he studied
    Armenian and Georgian with Gérard Garitte at the
    Catholic University of Louvain and spent some time at the
    Université St.-Joseph in Beirut, where he studied Arabic
    and Syriac. Meanwhile he also worked on his Coptic and
    Ethiopic; for the latter language he was in regular contact
    with Victor Arras, the renowned editor of the Ethiopic texts on
    the Virgin Mary’s death and the only authority on
    Ethiopic then living in Belgium. For his doctorate Michel
    embarked, under the supervision of professor Garitte, on a
    study of the earliest Georgian homily collections. He obtained
    the degree of Doctor in Oriental History and Philology at the
    University of Louvain in 1975. His dissertation was published
    as <hi rend="italic">Les plus anciens homéliaires géorgiens.
    Étude descriptive et historique</hi> (Publications de
    l’Institut Orientaliste de Louvain 10; Louvain-la-Neuve,
    1975).</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P4"/>[4] In the
    following years, Michel made several trips to the Soviet Union,
    where he was able to study Eastern Christian manuscripts in
    Moscow, St. Petersburg (then Leningrad), Yerevan, and Tbilisi.
    To these trips Syriac scholars owe, among other things,
    Michel’s detailed description of the famous Syriac
    manuscript Leningrad (N.S.) no. 4, published in
    <hi rend="italic">Mélanges Antoine Guillaumont</hi> (1988).</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P5"/>[5] In the
    early eighties, Michel taught Classical Armenian and Georgian
    at the Pontificio Istituto di Studi Orientali in Rome and, for
    one year (1985), at the Institut Catholique in Paris. In 1987,
    he accepted the chair of “Philologie des Christlichen
    Orients” at the University of Munich. As the successor of
    Julius Assfalg, he was responsible for research and teaching in
    six languages: Armenian, Georgian, Syriac, (Christian) Arabic,
    Coptic, and Ethiopic (Ge’ez).</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P6"/>[6] After
    his retirement, in 1999, Michel continued to travel, to
    lecture, and to attend conferences, where his scholarly
    interventions, his engaging conversations, and his piano
    improvisations always were very much appreciated. He traveled
    to Armenia, the Middle East, and India. He lectured at the
    University of California, Los Angeles, made an extensive trip
    to China, and kept up his contacts in Rome, where he planned to
    move after his temporary stay in Louvain-la-Neuve. His friends
    and colleagues in Paris were looking forward to a prestigious
    lecture which he was invited to deliver at the Collège
    de France on January 14, 2004. A Festschrift celebrating his
    seventieth birthday was in preparation (this will now be turned
    into a memorial volume and is due to appear in St. Petersburg,
    as the first volume of <hi rend="italic">Scrinium. Revue de patrologie,
    hagiographie critique et histoire ecclésiastique</hi>,
    to be edited by A. Mouraviev and B. Lourié). No one was
    considering the possibility that Michel would be slowing down,
    least of all Michel himself!</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P7"/>[7] Michel
    did major text editions and translations in Greek and Georgian:
    two Greek homilies attributed in the manuscripts to either
    Basil of Caesarea or Gregory of Nyssa (in collaboration with
    Alexis Smets, Sources chrétiennes 160, 1970); a Georgian
    treatise attributed to an otherwise unknown author Barsabas of
    Jerusalem (Patrologia Orientalis 41, 1982); the Georgian
    version of Epiphanius of Cyprus’ “On weights and
    measures” (CSCO 460-461 / Iber. 19-20, 1984); and a
    Georgian Life of the Virgin Mary, attributed to Maximus
    Confessor (CSCO 478-479 / Iber. 21-22, 1986). A great number of
    shorter texts, in various languages, were edited, translated,
    and studied by him in articles which appeared in scholarly
    journals and collective volumes.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P8"/>[8] His
    doctoral dissertation (<hi rend="italic">Les plus anciens homéliaires
    géorgiens</hi>, 1975) consists of a detailed description
    and analysis of six early Georgian homily collections. The
    Georgian materials are compared to homily collections in other
    languages of the Christian East. The Syriac collections, which
    had just begun to be studied in a systematic way by
    Joseph-Marie Sauget, assume an important place in this
    comparison. The similarities between the various traditions as
    well as the specific content of the Georgian tradition thus
    clearly emerge. Among the Georgian homilies that have no
    parallel in any of the other traditions are nine homilies
    attributed to Melitius, bishop of Antioch between 360 and 381,
    of whose works only very little is preserved in Greek. Michel
    strongly argued in favor of the authenticity of these nine
    homilies. On three occasions Melitius quotes Ephrem and refers
    to passages which can be identified in the Syriac Hymns on the
    Nativity and in the Commentary on the Diatessaron. If the
    homilies are authentic, these references are among the very
    earliest external attestations concerning Ephrem’s works,
    made by an author who must have had direct or indirect access
    to the Syriac Ephrem.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P9"/>[9] The
    exploration of the Georgian homily collections provided Michel
    with many topics which he elaborated in ensuing publications.
    Of particular importance are his studies of the traditions
    surrounding Mary’s death (her “Falling
    Asleep”, Dormition, Transitus, or Assumption). Fifteen of
    his articles on this theme were reprinted under the title
    <hi rend="italic">Aux origines de la Dormition de la Vierge. Études
    historiques sur les traditions orientales</hi> (Collected
    Studies Series, Aldershot: Variorum, 1995). Georgian, Armenian,
    Coptic, and Arabic traditions are discussed here and a more
    general essay on “Les signes des temps dans la
    littérature syriaque” is included as well.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P10"/>[10]
    Syriac topics also are dealt with in a number of other studies,
    e.g., the Syriac Cross-finding legends, the Syriac version of
    the Agathangelos story, Syriac legends concerning the apostles
    (Philip and Andrew, in particular), and the Syriac transmission
    of Gregory of Nyssa’s panegyric on Gregory Thaumaturgus.
    Michel’s analyses of texts and of their complicated
    transmission often are very specialized and technical; they
    always attest to his intimate familiarity with the historical,
    cultural, theological, and liturgical aspects of the Christian
    East, in its various interrelated traditions.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P11"/>[11]
    Michel was known to colleagues and students as an extremely
    erudite and imaginative scholar, always willing to share his
    knowledge and enthusiasm with others, unswerving in his
    commitment to his work, and at times uncompromising. May this
    restless seeker and traveler have found his
    <hi rend="italic">lmênâ d-shaynâ</hi>, his Harbour of
    Peace!</p>

    bibliography of books and articles prepared by Michel himself.
    It contains seven books and 222 articles or chapters in books
    or collective volumes.</p>

         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P1"/>[1] As the
    first volume in its new dissertation series “Gorgias
    Dissertations: Early Christian Studies,” advertised on
    the book cover as “Ancient Christian Studies,”
    Gorgias Press published this past summer a recent dissertation,
    defended in Sweden in April 2001. In the study, entitled
    <hi rend="italic">John Rufus and the World Vision of Anti-Chalcedonian
    Culture</hi>, the author, Jan-Eric Steppa, refines the work he
    began as a master’s thesis on anti-Chalcedonian
    hagiography in a Syro-Palestinian setting. While the second
    half of both works show the same structure, the Ph.D.
    dissertation as a whole is a more comprehensive study,
    involving the cultural aspects of this literature. Given such a
    first in a new series, the present review will comment on both
    Steppa’s immediate work and on the achievements and
    shortcomings of Gorgias Press’s new series.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P2"/>[2] Steppa
    introduces his study with a brief review of models, constructed
    by Bacht, Frend, and more recently by Roldanus, that intend to
    explain the resistance of the ascetic community in Palestine to
    the Council of Chalcedon (A.D. 451). While Steppa sees kernels
    of truth in the claim that the motives of loyalty to the
    Alexandrian Patriarch, ascetic authority, and monastic
    involvement in ecclesiastical affairs were driving forces for
    the monks, he otherwise dismisses those earlier attempts as
    insufficient and intends to provide an improved model with the
    present study. Briefly discussing his methodological background
    in more general terms and along the lines of Averil Cameron and
    Patricia Cox, he understands the nature of biography and
    hagiographical writing as an interplay between fiction and
    history. Consequently, he isolates the three
    “hagiographic themes” of “the idea of the
    holy man, the rhetorical power of miracles and visions, and the
    representation of heresy” as “the characteristic
    features” of the works of John Rufus, insofar as those
    are extant. It is Steppa’s proposition that a discussion
    of those themes allows one to find the motivating force for
    anti-Chalcedonian monks in Palestine. Steppa also claims that
    it was the unique characteristic of anti-Chalcedonians to have
    “conce[ived] of the world as the arena of a cosmological
    war between God and the evil powers of the material
    world” (p. xxxv). However, the mere reference to the Book
    of Daniel or Revelation suffices to caution such claims.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P3"/>[3] The main
    body of the book consists of five chapters, entitled “The
    Stage of Resistance,” “The Texts,” “The
    Images of Authority,” “Signs and
    Revelations,” and “The Image of the Enemies.”
    The first two chapters, filling roughly the first half of the
    book, provide background information regarding the
    chronological development of the stages of the controversy as
    well as a presentation of aspects of John Rufus’s life
    and works. The second half of the study is a discussion of
    specific motives in Rufus’s works, which according to
    Steppa constitute key features of anti-Chalcedonian cultural
    identity. The reader would welcome a definition in the early
    part of the book of what exactly constitutes that concept of
    “culture” which Steppa assumes and references (p.
    166). Without a definition of terms, claims can be taken into
    any direction without control. His main interest appears to be
    the “world vision” of anti-Chalcedonians. Yet the
    attainment and proper understanding of such a “world
    vision” is not feasible without a consideration of the
    concrete material manifestations and social conditions and
    relations that shaped people’s lives. Occasionally, the
    book touches on socio-historical aspects, e.g., in the attempt
    to identify an anti-Chalcedonian, ascetic attitude towards work
    (pp. 104-105). Yet such adventures remain fragmentary and
    unrepresentative, since they are neither comprehensive nor
    balanced. For example, in his discussion of this ascetic
    attitude towards work Steppa neither mentions nor considers
    Rufus’s choice of the ascetic models of Melania and
    Pinianus and their embrace and appreciation of work as
    essential to the life of a [future] anti-Chalcedonian ascetic,
    namely Peter the Iberian himself (<hi rend="italic">Life of Peter the
    Iberian</hi> 28-29).</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P4"/>[4] The five
    chapters of the study can conveniently be divided into three
    parts. The first part, ch. 1, is a discussion of the setting of
    the events in time, space, and ideological framework, treating
    “the events in Palestine immediately after the Council of
    Chalcedon in 451,” anti-Chalcedonian asceticism in Gaza,
    Egypt as haven of orthodoxy and the “birthplace of
    monasticism,” and two fields of tension, one being that
    between ascetic retreat versus active community involvement,
    the other being that between the radical choice for orthodoxy
    and the willingness to compromise if necessary. While creating
    a new synthesis and presentation from earlier studies of the
    same source material, Steppa points to significant elements in
    the overall picture that have not yet received sufficient
    attention, e.g., the concern for the preservation of
    Trinitarian orthodoxy as a driving motive for
    anti-Chalcedonians in their opposition to Chalcedon. The
    discussion is strong in presenting the influence of Egyptian
    monasticism on anti-Chalcedonian ascetics in Palestine.
    Throughout, the book successfully details parallels between
    John Rufus’s works and the <hi rend="italic">Life of Antony</hi>. It is
    regrettable that the study leaves out a consideration of the
    relevance and impact of Basilian ascetic ideas, which are
    clearly reflected in the primary texts, even in the ones quoted
    in the study itself (e.g., p. 94).</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P5"/>[5] With a
    wealth of detail, in the second part of the study Steppa
    assembles in ch. 2 a picture of John Rufus as author. He also
    provides basic information concerning Rufus’s extant
    works. Since Rufus’s authorship of the three works
    discussed, i.e., the <hi rend="italic">Life of Peter the Iberian</hi>, the
    <hi rend="italic">Commemoration of the Death of Theodosius</hi>, and the
    <hi rend="italic">Plerophories</hi>, is not unanimously held in modern-day
    scholarship (e.g., Orlandi), at least an acknowledgement of
    those dissenting views would have been in place. The somewhat
    negligent treatment of facts, e.g., Peter the Iberian dying in
    489 AD on p. 58 and in 491 AD on p. 61, raise doubt as to the
    ultimate reliability of the overall picture of Rufus’s
    life and work presented in this chapter.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P6"/>[6] In the
    third part of the study, chs. 3, 4, and 5, roughly the second
    half of the book, Steppa turns to a detailed discussion of the
    above mentioned “hagiographical themes.” The first
    theme, with which he deals in ch. 3, is that of the
    anti-Chalcedonian holy man. Steppa sees him (or her) as a mere
    instrument in the hand of God, who in turn works with
    “absolute initiative” (p. 100). Consequently, the
    claim is formulated that this feature of non-negotiable
    instrumentality is the distinctive moment, characterizing the
    anti-Chalcedonian holy man as virtuous model for respective
    ascetics in Palestine. In the course of his discussion, Steppa
    suggests the matrix of the four images of the holy man as
    model, intercessor, prophetic witness, and extraordinary sign
    as typical of Eastern monastic hagiography and usefully applies
    the first three to the evidence found in Rufus’s texts.
    His own discussion of extreme forms of asceticism in the case
    of Heliodorus should also be counted as in incident of
    “extraordinary sign,” thus widening the relevance
    of this category beyond the scope he assigns to it (p. 85). The
    wider audience will benefit from Steppa’s valuable
    attempt at contrasting the program of correlating orthodoxy
    with asceticism found in John Rufus with that of Cyril of
    Scythopolis. While Rufus’s ascetics in renouncing the
    civilized world are drawn to the disorder of the wilderness,
    Cyril’s holy desert dwellers in fact are portrayed as
    preferring the order of the civilized world. Moreover, while
    Rufus appears to locate much of ascetic authority in personal
    charisma and “individual progress” made “on
    the path of asceticism,” for Cyril attainment of truth
    turns out to be a result of “obedience to the
    ecclesiastical hierarchy” (p. 111).</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P7"/>[7] In the
    discussion of the second theme, i.e., of frequent visions and
    miracles employed in the presumably cosmological struggle,
    which constitutes ch. 4, Steppa plays off against one another
    the two functions which are fulfilled by visions and miracles
    in Rufus’s works, significantly more prominent in the
    <hi rend="italic">Plerophories</hi> than in the <hi rend="italic">Life of Peter the
    Iberian</hi>, namely that they work as “express
    confirmations of God’s verdict against the Chalcedonian
    bishops rather than as rhetorical markers of the virtuous
    qualities of the saintly protagonists.” Given the
    centrality of the <hi rend="italic">Plerophories</hi> in this regard, a
    discussion of the concept “plerophoriae” and its
    use either as noun or in derived forms in verbs, adverbs, and
    the like, would have been helpful. A glance into Lampe’s
    <hi rend="italic">Patristic Lexicon</hi> provides sufficient references that
    allow for a comparative study between Rufus’s and other
    early Christian authors’ use of the term, thus allowing
    the researcher to sharpen or relativize any distinctly
    anti-Chalcedonian connotations of its usage. Particularly in
    this chapter, Steppa recounts chains of events, taken from the
    stories in Rufus’s works, a feature of the study which is
    helpful for those researchers who are not be able to consult
    the Syriac text or the French translation of the
    <hi rend="italic">Plerophories</hi> directly. Not infrequently these stories
    are left to speak for themselves, without clear guidance for
    the reader as to what exactly the connecting moments or
    important aspects of a given piece are, other than being
    incidents of a “vision” predicting the horrors of
    Chalcedon. Again, a distortion of details in the summaries of
    individual scenes (e.g., p. 128, the church referred to in
    <hi rend="italic">Plerophories</hi> 11 is the Church of the Ascension; pp. 131
    and 138, Syriac <hi rend="italic">dukto</hi> [Plerophories 41 and 38] means
    “place,” not “road”) calls into
    question the soundness of the conclusions drawn on the basis of
    such abbreviated presentations. Rufus’s construction of a
    connection between Peter the Iberian and Peter of Alexandria
    also intends to join the leader of ascetics in Palestine with
    the famous leader of the Church in Egypt, as Steppa points out.
    For Rufus, there is evidence of a connection between the Monk
    Romanus and Peter the Iberian and more prominently between
    Theodosius of Jerusalem and the Apostle James (p. 136, fn. 58).
    Yet beyond Steppa’s reading, one should notice that
    ultimately this evidence points to Rufus’s overall
    preference for connecting significant leaders with one another
    and ideally with apostolic authorities in order to be able to
    lay claim to that apostolic foundation of the faith of
    anti-Chalcedonians. In that case, retrospectively, the
    important connecting moment between Peter the Iberian and Peter
    of Alexandria (beyond the latter’s prominent role as
    martyr, which opens up yet another field of reference and
    influence) is their common apostolic namesake. In the end, one
    may disagree with Steppa’s evaluation of Rufus’s
    application of the label “holy man.” Instead of
    seeing that character of the anti-Chalcedonian “holy
    man” “fade into the background and join a diverse
    group of protagonists that includes venerable ascetics, simple
    priests and deacons, intellectuals, and women” (p. 141),
    one may be inclined to reason in the other direction and
    acknowledge that in Rufus’s assessment, everyone who
    holds on to the true faith becomes a “holy man or
    woman,” and therefore is appropriately labelled as such
    throughout the text (e.g., <hi rend="italic">Plerophories</hi> 35: “the
    holy woman Eliana”; <hi rend="italic">Plerophories</hi> 44: “the
    holy bishop Epiphanius”; <hi rend="italic">Plerophories</hi> 45:
    “holy ones, old Cilician monks”; or also in clear
    contrast, <hi rend="italic">Plerophories</hi> 56: “the unholy
    Juvenal”).</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P8"/>[8] The
    third theme, the image of the enemy as heretic, forms the
    subject matter of the final chapter. Having established and
    documented that the rules of hagiography require the heretic as
    a counter-figure to the holy man, Steppa goes into greater
    depth when discussing the perception of Chalcedon as an
    anti-Trinitarian heresy in the eyes of anti-Chalcedonians, as
    well as their refusal to participate in common eucharistic
    services as the accepted means of separation from heresy. Both
    of these are important moments in the development of
    anti-Chalcedonian self-understanding, which Steppa rightly
    acknowledges. Yet he does not take the time to discuss the
    significance of such convictions and actions in their impact on
    ecclesiastical identity. What is needed is more detailed
    investigation and reflection concerning those earliest stages
    in the process of establishing a separate anti-Chalcedonian
    Church. To describe the notion of heresy through recourse to
    the image of disease is certainly a possibilty; but the only
    concrete example from Rufus’s works cited in the text
    (<hi rend="italic">Plerophoriae</hi> 80 discussed at p. 158) does not bear out
    any such claim. The woman’s illness is not described or
    suggested as in any way linked to her prior forced attendance
    at the Chalcedonian liturgy. Rather the accompanying
    circumstances of her illness, presumably delirium, seem to be
    used to link her backwards with previous events, but are not
    caused by them.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P9"/>[9] In his
    conclusion, Steppa locates the doctrinal dimension of
    Rufus’s theological worldview within the parameters of
    anti-Chalcedonianism as it was defined by the thought of
    Severus of Antioch and studied by Lebon. His final comments
    that future researchers could fruitfully pursue the
    intellectual, social, liturgical, and ecclesiological
    dimensions of the controversies can only be seconded.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P10"/>[10] One
    finds contradictions in the study, e.g., seemingly at-random
    choices between a translation derived from Raabe’s German
    translation and attempts at a closer reading of the Syriac
    text, the language in which Rufus’s works are exclusively
    preserved, (e.g., p. 2, citation of <hi rend="italic">Life of Peter the
    Iberian</hi> 52, where one should read “circumcised”
    instead of “excommunicated,” versus an attempt
    later on [p. 100] to draw out more fully and in sharper
    contours the portrait of the “enemy,” and thus
    employing the actual meaning of the Syriac word). Such
    inconsistencies between the translation and the understanding
    of the original text reveal the lack of a coherently developed
    picture of events and characterizations attempted in this
    study.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P11"/>[11] A
    major point of critique with Steppa’s overall approach to
    the subject matter rests with his lack of accounting for the
    literary chronology of Rufus’s <hi rend="italic">opera</hi> and its
    implications. He mixes quotes from those three works that can
    reasonably be attributed to Rufus into a largely
    undifferentiated amalgamate (except for an afterthought briefly
    on pp. 121-122). Thus he fails to take into account with
    sufficient clarity and rigor the discernible historical
    development of the literary production of Rufus’s work.
    Clearly, the <hi rend="italic">Life of Peter the Iberian</hi> as arguably the
    first one of his works does <hi rend="italic">not</hi> feature holy men, i.e.,
    most obviously Peter the Iberian, as “having no
    importance of their own as human beings in the world” (p.
    xxxvi). Steppa himself provides the counterexample from the
    <hi rend="italic">Life of Peter the Iberian</hi> 19 (pp. 119-120, with
    misleading cross-references in the footnotes), identifying
    Peter’s vision of Christ as a monk as an illustration of
    “the theological idea of the constant interplay between
    God’s will and the holy man’s own initiative”
    (p. 120). Thus an awareness of, and a more nuanced approach to,
    the different stages of Rufus’s writing career would have
    helped to better elucidate the impact of the role of the author
    in the construction of what is potentially an anti-Chalcedonian
    <hi rend="italic">Weltanschauung</hi>.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P12"/>[12]
    Steppa’s discussion presupposes a relationship between
    hagiography, history, and truth. Following Cameron and Cox, he
    suggests that the truth claim in this relationship was
    expressed by the construction of a historical narrative which
    was primarily and almost exclusively intended to construct
    communal identity. With an emphasis on deconstructionist
    analysis, the question to what extent the “play”
    between history and fiction ever emphasized the side of
    “history” is not discussed. While a lot can be
    gained from studying Rufus as a hagiographer, such an approach
    is far from sufficient. Although any historian, no matter how
    hard she or he tries, ultimately will admit that the
    historiographical product is and cannot be free from
    ideological concerns, in order to be fully understood,
    Rufus’s work does need to be appreciated as
    historiography, a perspective not pursued by Steppa.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P13"/>[13]
    Steppa’s bibliography reflects a selectively adequate
    approach to literature on asceticism and hagiography in the
    context of Chalcedonian / anti-Chalcedonian struggles in the
    larger Syro-Palestinian milieu. Yet his choices are
    unnecessarily restrictive and fail to allow him to engage in
    discussion with current scholarship on asceticism in the Gaza
    area (e.g., Jennifer Hevelone-Harper, “Letters to the
    Great Old Man: Monks, laity, and spiritual authority in
    sixth-century Gaza [Palestine],” Ph.D. thesis, Princeton
    University, 2000), contemporary monastic violence in Palestine
    (e.g., the final chapter in John Michael Gaddis, “There
    is no crime for those who have Christ: Religious violence in
    the Christian Roman Empire,” Ph.D. thesis, Princeton
    University, 1999), or even, more pertinently, studies of
    key-figures of the Palestinian anti-Chalcedonian milieu (e.g.,
    Kathleen M. Hay, “Evolution of resistance: Peter the
    Iberian, itinerant bishop,” in: <hi rend="italic">Prayer and
    Spirituality in the Early Church</hi> , pp. 159-168; or Cornelia
    B. Horn, “Beyond theology: The career of Peter the
    Iberian in the Christological controversies of fifth-century
    Palestine,” Ph.D. thesis, The Catholic University of
    America, 2001). Given that so much rests on the discussion of
    the correlation between charismatic authority of the ascetic
    versus ecclesiastical or institutional authority, one wonders
    why none of these respective studies is consulted in order to
    set the anti-Chalcedonian version à la Rufus into its
    proper context. Insofar as an object of research is to be
    defined appropriately both by reference to the quality of its
    inner core and by the extension of its outer borders, one also
    would expect some discussion of those ascetics who switched
    their allegiance in the course of the historical development of
    the controversy. Michael Kohlbacher’s on-going work on
    Markianos of Bethlehem (e.g., in <hi rend="italic">Studia Patristica</hi> 29)
    would be an excellent starting point for such investigations.
    Overall, the book reflects the background and influence of
    selected voices of the “holy man” discussion. It
    lacks a more detailed study of the primary texts, e.g.,
    tracking down Scriptural allusions, which would have helped in
    coming to a fuller understanding of the meaning of rhetorical
    and literary choices in the inner-textual context.</p>

    first glance, the overall text layout on the page and the
    design on the front cover of the series are pleasing. The
    expensive price for a paperback is to be explained by the
    limited circulation that is to be expected for such specialized
    studies. At second glance, however, glaring errors in the text
    distort the picture. Omissions of complete citations of works
    at their first occurrence in the text (e.g., xxxv), reversal of
    date and place of publication in bibliographic entries (p.
    176), misspellings of the names of ancient authors
    (“Isodore” on p. 176), misspelled foreign names (p.
    178), and other such mistakes and oversights fall within the
    proper framework of proofreading a Ph.D. thesis for
    publication. The admittedly demanding task of proofreading and
    editing such works includes avoiding, e.g., inconsistencies in
    choice of italics or styles of punctuation, typographical
    errors (e.g., for the last three items pp. xiii-xiv and 139),
    mixing of lower case and upper case layout in headlines (p.
    xv), repetitions of complete sentences within the text (p. 76),
    wrong word choices (throughout, e.g., p. 140), sentence
    fragments (e.g., pp. 140 and 150), or completely misleading
    cross-references (e.g., p. 120, fn. 18; p. 126, fn. 33). To
    have available a dissertation series in the field of Eastern
    Christian or Syriac studies, which has a quick turn-over is
    certainly useful in the short run. Yet the desirability of such
    a series will only be proven in the long run if the overall
    quality of the manuscript preparation and book production
    increases significantly.</p>

    Overall Steppa’s study is useful, not least because it
    raises issues that need to be pursued in future, in-depth
    research. It accomplishes valuable work by sifting monastic
    literature for examples that illuminate the concepts of
    “holy man,” “ascetic attitudes towards
    visions and dreams,” and “conceptions of the
    heretic.” Steppa has beneficially applied those concepts
    with their attributes and specifications in ascetic literature
    to Rufus’s works and it is to be hoped that his research
    in this direction will continue and deepen. The book
    contributes to the study of Palestinian asceticism by
    highlighting the significance of ideological constructions of
    communal identity. Yet while the author has “brought into
    some light” what he perceives to be “specific
    characteristics of anti-Chalcedonian culture,” how
    “characteristic” they ultimately are remains to be
    seen. If his claim that “John Rufus’ works
    uncover[.] a world vision that is focused on the notion of the
    absolute initiative of God, whereas the holy men are reduced to
    [being] merely instruments for God’s announcement of his
    judgement upon Chalcedon” (p. xxxv) needed no
    modification, then anti-Chalcedonian identity, as created on
    paper by Rufus, would have quite a bit in common with both Old
    Testament prophecy and Radical Reformers, and thus would not be
    so “specific[ally] characteristic[.]” afterall.</p>

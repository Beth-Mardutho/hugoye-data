            <p xml:lang="en">The expression “Syriac Masora” refers to manuscripts
                containing vocalized excerpts from biblical and patristic works, which constituted
                the core of the Syriac educational system in the early medieval periods. This term
                was coined in the late nineteenth century by W. Wright and J. Martin as an analogy
                to the work of the famous Masoretes, who standardized the proper reading of the
                Hebrew Bible. Despite some attempts to apply other expressions, based on the genuine
                Syriac tradition (e.g., the “<hi rend="italic">Qarqapta</hi> tradition” or “<hi
                    rend="italic">shmahe</hi> manuscripts”), the term “Masora” gained general
                acceptance, although the fact that this term appears in the quotation marks in
                Loopstra’s book suggests that it still needs justification.</p>
            <p xml:lang="en">The present book continues a series of publications by Jonathan
                Loopstra, which started with his PhD thesis, defended in 2009. The thesis included a
                facsimile publication and an annotated transcription of the part of manuscript Vat.
                Sir. 152 containing the “names and readings” extracted from patristic writings. In
                2015, Loopstra prepared a facsimile edition and transcription of the only known East
                Syriac “masoretic” manuscript, BL Add. 12,138, which contains the biblical “Masora”.
                In his latest book, the author states that he is planning both further editions of
                the masoretic manuscripts and systematic studies of the history of the Syriac
                Masora.</p>
            <p xml:lang="en">With these publications, Loopstra provides modern scholars with
                invaluable sources for the history of the Syriac language and the Christian
                educational system. Syriac masoretic manuscripts open a window into the reading and
                writing practices of Syriac scribes in the tenth and eleventh centuries, which may
                greatly contribute to modern studies of Syriac grammar, phonology, and
                transcription. The Syriac Masora is also an important source for the history of the
                interaction between Greek and Syriac languages, as most of the “names and readings”
                that appear in the masoretic collections derive from Syriac translations from the
                Greek. More than that, each masoretic collection turns out to be a concentrated
                library, which on several folios may contain information about texts occupying whole
                codices.</p>
            <p xml:lang="en">The book under review provides a further witness to the
                tradition of the Syriac Masora. It contains two parts. The first one is an
                introduction to the patristic Masora, and its historical and educational context.
                The second part presents the patristic Masora preserved in manuscript Damascus Syr.
                7/16 (dated 1004 <hi rend="smallcaps">c.e</hi>.) and an analysis of its Greek
                sources. It includes a careful transcription of each excerpt (with vocalization) and
                locates it in a Syriac manuscript that contains the full version of the excerpted
                treatise, and identifies the underlying Greek text by means of references to the PG.
                This part will certainly prove to be an invaluable tool for modern editors of the
                works of, e.g., Basil the Great and Gregory of Nazianzus.</p>
            <p xml:lang="en">In the first, introductory part of his book, Loopstra outlines
                the main characteristics of the patristic Masora and attempts to reconstruct its
                instructional function. Here, the author refrains from drawing clear conclusions.
                Rather, he suggests various explanations of the possible <hi rend="italic">Sitz im
                    Leben</hi> of the masoretic collections.</p>
            <p xml:lang="en">The collections of the patristic Masora appear later than the
                biblical masoretic manuscripts (which include also the East Syriac manuscript BL
                Add. 12,138). All extant manuscripts containing the patristic Masora are of the West
                Syriac origin. Most of them were composed between 980 and the late eleventh century
                in the region of Melitene (some are connected with the regions of Nineveh and
                Tikrit). However, they reflect a long pedagogical tradition, which probably began in
                the seventh century and fade in the thirteenth. They contain translations that
                derive from the scholars of the famous monastery of Qenneshre and thus reflect the
                West Syriac educational background.</p>
            <p xml:lang="en">The patristic Masora includes the works of Ps.-Dionysius the
                Areopagite, Basil of Caesarea, Gregory of Nazianzus, and Severus of Antioch. Some
                additional treatises appear in various manuscripts as appendices. Chapter 5 of the
                book outlines the content of one such appendix, in manuscript Damascus Syr. 12/22,
                containing excerpts from the works of Ephrem the Syrian, Isaac of Antioch, and Jacob
                of Serugh. This appendix demonstrates how the texts of the classical Syriac writers
                were read in the period of the late Syriac Renaissance. However, most of the
                masoretic collections contain a standard set of sample texts, though they may differ
                in some details. For example, sometimes the masoretic manuscripts contain multiple
                variants of the same words, thus serving as a sort of a critical apparatus to the
                texts.</p>
            <p xml:lang="en">The differences between various manuscripts are significant
                enough to consider them as individual collections. Loopstra pays attention to the
                common scribal errors found in different manuscripts, which suggests that their
                compilers made use of the earlier lists or collections of “difficult words and
                readings.” However, Loopstra reaches the conclusion that no original collection or
                “master” manuscript may be reconstructed by way of textual criticism.</p>
            <p xml:lang="en">The order of words excerpted in the masoretic manuscripts
                follows that of the full text of the treatises. Thus, the masoretic manuscripts were
                most likely used together with the full texts of the patristic works and were
                intended to provide help for the correct vocalization, and in some cases for a
                better understanding of these works. Thus, their readers not only needed to have
                both manuscripts in front of them, but also required teachers who would instruct
                them. There is some evidence that the excerpts included in the masoretic collections
                were used in grammatical training, for the same passages appear in treatises on
                grammar. The patristic Masora includes also elements that derive from glosses and
                marginal notes in the non-masoretic manuscripts. Moreover, the masoretic manuscripts
                contain their own glosses and scholia, scribbled in the margins, which reflect an
                ongoing teaching practice that included both the proper vocalization and
                pronunciation of particular elements, and their interpretation.</p>
            <p xml:lang="en">Each part of the book would have been worthwhile to have been
                published separately. The amount of materials packed in the whole volume is immense,
                and the book is destined to serve as a reference tool for scholars working with
                different patristic texts. It would therefore have been very helpful if the volume
                had included indexes, to facilitate navigation and a quick search. Although the
                second part contains a useful index of Greek, Hebrew, and Latin words that appear in
                the patristic Masora in manuscript Damascus Syr. 7/16, neither a subject index nor
                an index of references for the introductory part has been included. Instead, a list
                of Syriac manuscripts to which the author refers in the introductory part is
                included into the bibliography, but this does not provide help for searching the
                first part of the book. Nonetheless, it is certainly worth reading this book from
                beginning to end in order to gain insight into the Syriac intellectual and
                pedagogical life during one of the most exciting and productive epochs of Syriac
                culture, the period around the turn to the second millennium <hi rend="smallcaps"

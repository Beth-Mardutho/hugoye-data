         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P1"/>[1] The
    volume at hand inaugurates an exciting new series. Entitled
    <hi rend="italic">Eastern Christian Texts</hi>, this series is published by the
    Middle Eastern Texts Initiative (METI) of Brigham Young
    University. Like its counterpart, the well-received <hi rend="italic">Islamic
    Translation Series</hi>, likewise published by METI, this series
    offers English translations of seminal works, accompanied on
    facing page by texts in their original language. In terms of
    scope, <hi rend="italic">Eastern Christian Texts</hi> is to include works from
    all of the diverse eastern Christian communities. In terms of
    audience, it is aimed both at specialists and non-specialists.
    Accompanying this new series is another, <hi rend="italic">The Library of the
    Christian East</hi>, also published by METI. This second series
    will offer extensive introductions to important authors, with
    selections of their writings in translation, as well as surveys
    of important themes in the history of eastern Christianity. For
    an overview of these series, a presentation of their
    international advisory boards, and prospectives for future
    volumes, the reader may wish to consult METI's website
    (<ref target="http://meti.byu.edu/">http://meti.byu.edu/</ref>).</p>
         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P2"/>[2] The
    present volume is the first translation into English of Yahya
    ibn <hi rend="sup">
               <hi rend="italic">c</hi>
            </hi>Adi's (d. 974) <hi rend="italic">Tahdhib
    al-akhlaq.</hi>�This work is a multifarious ethical compendium.
    In part, it is concerned with philosophical issues: the nature
    of human moral qualities; the character of the tripartite soul;
    the cataloguing and definition of virtues and vices; and how
    the baser parts of the soul might be made subject to its
    rational part. In part, it is a mirror for princes, offering a
    description of the perfect ruler and gentle advice for those
    less than perfect—not least among their neglected duties being
    the support of scholars. In part, it is a hortative discourse,
    aiming at the "instruction of prospective students and future
    leaders ... be they Muslim or Christian, in order to inculcate
    in them the requisite moral attitude for the practice of the
    philosophical way of life" (xlii), that they might become as
    "the perfect man" (<hi rend="italic">al-insan al-kamil</hi>).</p>
         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P3"/>[3] There
    can be no doubt that Yahya's work merits its place at the head
    of a series designed to present seminal works of the eastern
    Christian tradition. Its author was one of the most famous and
    most prolific of Christian Arab philosophers. A member of the
    Syrian Orthodox Church, he was a student of al-Farabi and of
    al-Farabi's own teacher, Abu Bishr Matta ibn Yunus, and was
    himself the teacher of many who would go on to renown of their
    own. He is a figure perhaps best known for his contributions to
    the formation of the Aristotelian school of Baghdad. Moreover,
    of Yahya's many works, the present is one of his most popular,
    a fact well illustrated by the number of manuscripts in which
    it survives (more than twenty) and by the number of times it
    has been edited (to date, twenty). The most recent and best of
    these editions was prepared by Samir Khalil, published as
    <hi rend="italic">Yahya ibn <hi rend="sup">
                  <hi rend="italic">c</hi>
               </hi>Adi (893-974): Tahdhib
    al-ahlaq</hi> (Beirut: CEDRAC, 1994). It is this text, sans
    apparatus, that has been taken as the basis of the present
    translation and printed on the facing page, with full
    vocalization.</p>
         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P4"/>[4] Griffith
    opens his volume with an introduction to the life of Yahya, the
    context within which he lived and wrote, a presentation of
    Yahya's <hi rend="italic">Reformation of Morals</hi>, and a placing of it in
    its social and literary context. As Griffith argues, Yahya's is
    a singular work. It shares much with earlier discussions of
    ethics in the Hellenic, pre-Islamic, and Persianate traditions.
    There are superficially similar works in the Muslim
    philosophical tradition. Even so, Yahya's work is unique. While
    he drew on sources many and diverse, Yahya crafted from those
    sources his own vision of the philosophical life. And
    strikingly, this vision is absent religious reference. Its
    conceptual framework is the human being and the pursuit of
    happiness through humane ideals. This is not to say that the
    work is opposed to the monotheisms of the early medieval Near
    East. Indeed, as Griffith argues, it offers an understanding of
    the philosophical life, such that it might be pursued by
    adherents of any of the faith traditions, having as its ideal
    perfect humanity (<hi rend="italic">insaniyah</hi>), "that is to say, humane
    behavior in the social sphere ... a prerequisite for the
    well-being of both philosophy and religion in society" (p.
    xliii).</p>
         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P5"/>[5] As to
    manner of translation, Griffith's goal was "accurately to
    express the thought of Yahya ibn <hi rend="sup">
               <hi rend="italic">c</hi>
            </hi>Adi in a
    literal rendering of the Arabic, consistent with the
    requirements of intelligible English expression" (p. xlvi).
    That he achieved that goal is evident throughout. Indeed, he
    has achieved far more. Yahya's cannot have been an easy work to
    translate. Modern English frequently lacks words, clearly
    defined in semantic range, with which to express the sorts of
    ethical states, virtues, and vices discussed by Yahya. And what
    words there are often exist only in religious discourse.
    Yahya's translator carefully avoids English terms that bear
    overly religious significance, and has remained faithful to
    Yahya's own vision of "perfect humanity."�Furthermore, Yahya's
    text is composed in a form of ornamental, rhythmic prose, in
    which style at times takes precedence over the ordered
    presentation of ideas. Rather than Yahya's normal, syllogistic
    manner of presentation, in this text each rhetorical period is
    meant to be savored in for itself. The work is, as it were, a
    collection of beautifully ornate proverbs and bons mots,
    delicately interwoven. Yahya's translator captures a sense of
    the gossamer beauty of his Arabic original, and has enabled
    Yahya's graceful prose to shine through, even in English
    guise.</p>

                <p xml:lang="en">Monographs on the <hi rend="italic">Liber Graduum (Book of
                        Steps/Buch der Stufen)</hi> are still rare, although depending upon one's
                    language skills it is still humanly possible to read all the articles and
                    studies on this book. Gisela Fuchs' doctoral dissertation at the University of
                    Bonn has approached this enigmatic early Syriac work by an in-depth study of a
                    recurring cluster of ideas, images and references to the activity of Satan and
                    evil occurring throughout the corpus. Burrowing deep inside the language and
                    imagery of the <hi rend="italic">Liber Graduum (LG)</hi>, Fuchs unveils
                    surprising and often unnoticed dimensions in this anonymous collection. The
                    converse of the old adage can be true: by looking very closely at the individual
                    trees, one can better understand the forest.</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">Indeed, the references to Satan and his rebellion are, pun
                    intended, "legion." At first sight, the anonymous author's language about Satan
                    appears to be part of the biblical vocabulary employed heavily by him, but Fuchs
                    sees at play a more fundamental dynamic for the economy of the <hi rend="italic"
                        >LG</hi>. Concentrating upon four <hi rend="italic">m?mr?</hi> (Number
                    Seven: "On the Commandments of the Upright"; Fifteen: "On Adam's Marital
                    Desire"; Twenty-One: "On the Tree of Adam"; and Twenty-Three: "On Satan and the
                    Pharaoh and the Israelites") Fuchs identifies the central theme permeating <hi
                        rend="italic">LG</hi> as the argument and battle with Evil and labels the
                    author's persistent efforts to attain "victory over evil" as the <hi
                        rend="italic">summa theologica</hi> of the <hi rend="italic">LG</hi>. The
                    title of this monograph, "Rebellion and Fall," reflects the nature of humanity's
                    struggle with Evil. The return to the lost Paradise of Eden by Adam and the
                    regaining of his original Perfection by means of <hi rend="italic"
                        >apokatastasis</hi>, Fuchs nevertheless insists, is the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Hauptthema</hi> of <hi rend="italic">LG</hi> which prefigures the attempt
                    of the Perfect (<hi rend="italic">gm?r?</hi>) of the <hi rend="italic">LG</hi>
                    community to re-enter Eden.</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">The typology underlying this narrative is signified by the
                    relationship between Satan and Adam. Satan is the <hi rend="italic">typos</hi>,
                    the Rebel who fell and was overthrown from heaven, who then becomes the teacher,
                    instructing and tempting Adam to obey him rather than God. Adam becomes the
                    student of Satan and obeys him, becoming the anti-type, for "Adam fell from
                    heaven with that same fall by which the Rebel had slipped and fallen" (<hi
                        rend="italic">m?mr?</hi> 21, section 18). "He (Adam/human being)," moreover,
                    "obeyed Satan and became Satan" (23.4). Fuchs traces the two variant traditions
                    which state that Adam "fell from heaven" (???) and "was driven out" (???) of
                    Paradise, noting that the two other principal characters in the biblical saga –
                    Eve and the Snake  are considered by these traditions as "extras" who were not
                    essential in the ongoing drama. Adam wanted to be like God, and thus was induced
                    by Satan to enjoy eating with no mention of Eve's famous encouragement. Fuchs
                    could have cited here Philoxenos of Mabbug's memorable dictum from his <hi
                        rend="italic">Discourses</hi> that "the lust of the belly is the beginning
                    of all sin" (<hi rend="italic">Discourse</hi> 10.60).</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">The literal and figurative nexus of this falling and eating is the
                    Tree in the Garden of Eden. Fuchs aligns the uses of a "Baumsatanologie" (21.1;
                    cf. Fuchs pp. 165-166) as sources of the fall and expulsion of Adam and Eve from
                    Paradise. They obeyed and learned from Satan, and so Satan is "personified" as
                    the Tree, from which people still eat. The author of the <hi rend="italic"
                        >LG</hi> countered with a "Baumchristologie": people eat from "the Tree of
                    Life, that is our Lord" (20.7); "The good tree, in that world of light invisible
                    to the eyes of flesh, is our Lord Jesus" (21.2); "...the Tree of Life of the
                    Garden of Eden by which people are saved from death, this Tree being the
                    Life-giving Spirit..." (29.19).</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">Fuchs identifies a passage as a "hymn of the Fall of Adam" (15.7),
                    in which Adam watches the animals and desires to become like them sexually.
                    Hating the celibacy of the angels, he wants to become greater than they are and
                    to be like God, causing the angels great distress. Showing how the "imitation of
                    the animals" echoes Psalms 49:13 and 8:6, Fuchs then offers an excursus from
                    other sources on this tradition of humans watching the animals in order to learn
                    how to behave sexually.</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">This activity of animal watching is used several times by the
                    Author to illustrate the straying desires of Adam and Eve for sexuality and lust
                    and their lack of trust in God's providence. They hated celibacy or holiness
                    (<hi rend="italic">qaddīšūtā</hi>), so God relented and allowed them to
                    marry. The couple did not realize that God possessed the ability and will to
                    eventually give them children without lust or sexuality. In this vein, the
                    Author recites the surprising tradition that "If all people desire to become
                    holy (i.e., celibate), I (God) would create for them children just as I made a
                        <hi rend="italic">daughter</hi> for Adam from himself, without marriage and
                    without lust" (25.3; Syriac text, <hi rend="italic">Patrologia Syriaca</hi> III,
                    737:26-740:2). This subtle insertion reflects the concept that Adam had in
                    essence given birth to Eve, by the agency of God and without sexuality (Adam's
                    rib), and therefore she was his daughter  which itself is a prefiguration or
                    type of the Virgin Birth.</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">What the Author has been rehearsing throughout his writings, Fuchs
                    deduces, is a protological anthropology which presents the narrative of the
                    origins of human existence and the emergence and fall of Evil, a predominantly
                    negative and still functioning narrative. She identifies two early works that
                    provide similar tendencies towards such a protological anthropology as
                    background for the Author, the <hi rend="italic">Apocalypse of Moses</hi> and
                    the <hi rend="italic">Life of Adam and Eve</hi>. The former work appears to have
                    been translated from Syriac into Armenian and a Greek version is extant as well,
                    and the latter has some of its content in the Syriac <hi rend="italic">Cave of
                        Treasures</hi>. How much access the Author would have had to these works or
                    knowledge of their traditions remains a question.</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">Fuchs' analysis and insight into this strong current in the <hi
                        rend="italic">LG</hi> of the origins and operation of Evil, along with the
                    pairing of Satan and Adam as type and anti-type in the Author's reconstruction
                    of salvation, demonstrate an intellectual curiosity and creativity that invites
                    the reader to look more deeply into this text. Her perception that these
                    traditions and motifs provide the primary hermeneutic for the entire work has
                    tremendous validity, especially as the practical theology and spiritual
                    direction of the Author towards the implementation of Perfection continue to be
                    deciphered.</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">A gentle note, nonetheless, about these "trees" which constitute
                    this "forest" is worth mentioning. Fuchs recognizes that the return of Adam and
                    his descendants to Perfection and re- entering Eden is the essential movement of
                    this work. The Author expends much time and energy presenting the nature of this
                    return to Perfection and how he believes it should be accomplished in this
                    non-Edenic world. The reason the <hi rend="italic">LG</hi> is one of the most
                    important texts for early Syriac Christianity lies not so much in its
                    theological construction of the Perfect and Upright way of life, but in our
                    ability to read how this construction and movement was implemented, worked well
                    for a time, and failed perhaps miserably, and anonymously. The unique scenario
                    of the Perfect falling from Perfection, with the lowly Upright rising to near
                    Perfection in the Author's estimation, leaves behind much of the biblical
                    imagery, tradition history, and innumerable motifs employed, especially given
                    the virtual mid-sentence ending of <hi rend="italic">m?mr?</hi> 30, in which the
                    fate of the Author and his community disappears from history. The "trees" Fuchs
                    has identified and classified tell us a tremendous amount about the character of
                    early Syriac Christianity and the influences at play upon it and especially the
                        <hi rend="italic">LG</hi>, yet we still are straining to encompass the whole
                    forest of the <hi rend="italic">LG</hi> in one glance.</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">Fuchs has provided a rich resource for the nooks and crannies of
                    the discourse in the <hi rend="italic">LG</hi>. One gains a new appreciation for
                    the depth of learning and sophistication of that anonymous author, comprehending
                    more about his theological mind-set and worldview. Anyone who embarks upon the
                    study of this early Syriac work should find a place for this volume on their
                    desk at the beginning of their journey.</p>

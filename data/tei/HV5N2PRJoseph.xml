         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P1"/>[1] I would
    like to start with a crtitical observation made by Chip Coakley
    that especially puzzled me; let me quote his remarks: "With
    matters religious, ecclesiastical and missionary, Joseph is
    less comfortable. The reader who is told that 'after the
    Council of Ephesus, those who adhered to the teachings of
    Nestorius organized their own church' which was subsequently
    'forced to move in the direction of Mesopotamia and Persia' (p.
    41, a statement admittedly at variance with most of the rest of
    the chapter) will naturally be somewhat wary of the treatment
    of ecclesiastical matters later on in the book."</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P2"/>[2] The
    citation above combines two of my sentences into one and omits
    a part of each sentence, creating some unintended but
    troublesome distortions. The omitted parts of my remarks are
    placed within brackets: "After the Council of Ephesus, those
    who adhered to the teachings of Nestorius organized their own
    church, [establishing themselves first in Edessa. They were
    driven out of there soon after the Council of Chalcedon],
    forced to move further east in the direction of Mesopotamia and
    Persia."</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P3"/>[3] Since I
    could not see any discrepancy between the citation and "the
    rest of the chapter" and because Coakley did not explain the
    contradiction that was apparent to him, I reluctantly wrote and
    asked him to explain what was "at variance" between his
    citation and what followed, noting that I would comment on his
    explanation in my response. Below are the three points that
    Coakley kindly made in answer to my query; I will respond to
    point #1 after I've commented on points 2 and 3:</p>
         <p>1."What I did not like here was chiefly 'organized their own
    church'. The idea of having a separate church, with a different
    hierarchy, was, I think, slow in coming - and when it did
    happen, it happened with the so-called Monophysites. The
    "Nestorians" never - did they? - organize a separate hierarchy
    anywhere. At certain times, certain bishops in the Roman Empire
    were sympathetic to Nestorius, but that is quite different from
    'organizing their own church'."</p>
         <p>2. "...the phrase 'further east in the direction of
    Mesopotamia' sounds as if you don't realize that Edessa is
    already in Mesopotamia. A small matter, no doubt, but
    potentially confusing."</p>
         <p>
            <hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> there are two Mesopotamias involved here:
    1.Western Mesopotamia, ruled by the Roman/Byzantine empire, and
    2.The rest of Mesopotamia, ruled by the Persians. To write that
    "Edessa is already in Mesopotamia," is literally half-true; it
    is "already" in Byzantine Mesopotamia but not in the
    Mesopotamian territories under Persian domination, as Coakley
    seems to assume. For long a disputed frontier province,
    Mesopotamia's western region finally became Roman in 216 A.D.
    and continued as one of Roman/Byzantine empire's eastern
    provinces for almost four ceturies, until 609.</p>
         <p>3. "The church of Persia did not see itself as 'adhering to
    the teaching of Nestorius' - they may have heard of him, but
    they hardly knew what his "teaching" was - until the 7th
    century at the earliest."</p>
         <p>
            <hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> Here Coakley clearly places Edessa in
    Persian Mesopotamia. A second look at what I have actually
    said--3rd paragraph of p.1 above--shows: 1 The church of Persia
    is not mentioned at all; that is a subject yet to be discussed;
    2. In my text the subject of the verb "forced", is
    "They"--referring to "those who adhered to the teachings of
    Nestorius" in Byzantine Edessa. In Coakley's restructuring of
    my two sentences, where the name of Edessa is omitted, the
    subject of "forced" is "church"-- which to Coakley, is "The
    church of Persia..." of his point #3.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P4"/>[4] Coakley wrote that
    he did not like my statement that "those who adhered to the
    teachings of Nestorius organized their own church"--his point
    #1 above. The point that I was emphasizing in that sentence was
    that after the christological controversies of the 5th
    century--which I had just finished discussing--'Nestorianism'
    continued to be preached and taught in the Roman empire.This
    fact is well summed up by Arthur J. Maclean, of the Archbishop
    of Canterbury's Assyrian Mission fame. Nestorianism, wrote
    Maclean, "retained some footing in the Roman empire...", "for a
    considerable time...", before it reached "the later Nestorians"
    of Persia. (Maclean's article in <hi rend="italic">Encyclopedia of Religion
    and Ethics</hi>, under "Nestorianism", 1917 edition.)</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P5"/>[5] As briefly noted
    in my first two introductory chapters, Edessa was for long a
    stronghold of Syriac learning and tradition in Byzantium,
    highly regarded by the Aramaic-speaking eastern Christians.
    Edessa was also a center of Greek learning, translated into
    Syriac--"Greek learning in Syriac disguise," Han J.W.Drijvers
    calls it. At the theological school of Edessa, Nestorian
    doctrine was studied and developed, and so successfully, that
    its leading opponents were eventually able to obtain from
    emperor Zeno the closure of the school, in 489. It is pertinent
    to note here that even after Zeno, during the reign of emperor
    Anastasius, who succeeded Zeno, we still read of abused
    "Nestorian clergy" in the very capital of the empire,
    Constantinople. (J.B. Segal's <hi rend="italic">Edessa</hi>, p.102.)</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P6"/>[6] If a religious
    congregation has clergy, bishops, priests, a theology that it
    passionately upholds, and has a foothold in the Roman empire
    for a considerable time, why isn't it, by definition, a
    "church"? Do all churches of late antiquity have a "hierarchy"?
    We know that Edessa grew into one of the leading religious
    cities of Byzantium; its local Christianity, despite its links
    to Antioch, showed "a great variety of forms". (See R.
    Lavenant, <hi rend="italic">Encyclopedia of the Early Church</hi>, 1992, under
    "Edessa" ).</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P7"/>[7] The Nestorian
    exiles from Edessa found their way to nearby Nisibis, a town in
    Persian Mesopotamia since 363. There they started the famous
    school of Nisibis which became the center from which Nestorian
    teachings spread, leading to the establishment of "the later
    Nestorians", members of "the church of Persia"; that section of
    the chapter is marked by my heading 'NESTORIANISM' FINDS A HOME
    IN PERSIA (pp.41-44).</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P8"/>[8] In the same
    paragraph discussed above, Coakley writes: "It is also an
    ominous sign, that having banished the name 'Nestorian' from
    the title, the author retains it elsewhere in the book, even in
    the chapters covering the period after 1918 when it clearly
    includes people other than members of the Church of the East.
    For all that it may be a handy term, no theologically sensitive
    writer could do this." Let me just say that as a member of the
    Church who belongs to an earlier generation, when the name
    Nestorian was still used--and as one who had a favorite uncle
    named Nestorius--I did not feel the need to be either
    diplomatically or theologically correct. If the term was
    banished from the title of the revised edition, it was meant to
    be changed only in the title, as explained in my prefatory
    remarks, which Coakley well covers in his review.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P9"/>[9] Explaining where
    he would really "fault" me ("and others"), Coakley writes that
    I am "hardly interested in the primary, religious work of the
    missions (there are no tabulations of parishes, schools, books
    printed, etc. - they would be dull, to be sure), but only in
    the secondary, social and political, effects of this work."
    Perhaps I should note here that the title of my book is <hi rend="italic">The
    Nestorians and Their Muslim Neighbors</hi>, with the subtitle:
    <hi rend="italic">A Study of Western Influence on Their Relations</hi>. In the
    subtitle of the revised edition, "Western influence" of the
    original is more specifically identified as <hi rend="italic">Encounters with
    Western Christian Missions, Archaeologists, and Colonial
    Powers</hi>.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P10"/>[10] Nowhere in his
    review does Coakley say anything about the missions and
    Islam--how Islam was viewed by the early missionaries; the role
    that they hoped a "reformed Nestorian church" would play in the
    conversion of Islam, seen on its deathbed; or on the reaction
    of Muslims as they heard what they held holy being denigrated
    by these Western clergy. Even when commenting on my concluding
    chapter ('From Missions to Ecumenism'), where I survey Western
    Christian Missions' admirable reassessment of their position
    with regard to Islam--and other non-Christian faiths--Coakley
    sees there only "a discussion of the exercise of 'rethinking
    missions' ... and a section entitled 'The Roman Catholic Church
    and Islam', neither of which", he writes, "is particularly
    relevant to the Assyrians."</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P11"/>[11] According to
    Coakley my "praise" for the missionaries is limited "more or
    less, to their role in the relief of suffering during World War
    I". John P. Ameer raised a similar point in his review that
    recently appeared in an issue of <hi rend="italic">JAAS</hi>. In its next issue
    I will have a statement addressing that question, largely
    citing passages from the book that seem to be overlooked.
    Coakley, referring to page 69 of my text, writes, quoting a
    part of my sentence, that "these missions were the agents of
    'the political and cultural imperialism of the 'Christian
    powers'." The passage in question actually says the
    following:</p>
         <p>"Unfortunately for the evangelists, they had arrived at a
    difficult time for their spiritual campaign. The Russo-Persian
    conflict had already intensified Christian-Muslim animosities.
    Gradually through the nineteenth century, these out-of-the-way
    places, where the Nestorians had found refuge for the last five
    centuries or more, were to become a hornets' nest, disturbed by
    the political and cultural imperialism of the 'Christian'
    powers."</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P12"/>[12] The statement
    above does not say that "these missions were the agents" of the
    European powers; Coakley's clause actually distorts the meaning
    and intent of the above passage.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P13"/>[13] These
    differences of opinion on the missions aside, let me express my
    agreement with some of Chip Coakley's other critical
    observations. He is right that I am not an ecclesiastical
    historian, something that I have never claimed. On the history
    of the early church, as I have noted before, I have depended
    solely on reading scholarly secondary sources, some of them
    written by a few readers of this newsletter. I have learned
    much from the contributions of Chip Coakley himself; I dare say
    that no one has found his details more fascinating than I have.
    I agree with his comments on the absence of copy-editing; I
    myself was shocked and irritated by the number of typographical
    mistakes that mar many a page of the text. I take full
    responsibility for whatever inadequacies there are; how I wish
    I had paid a professional proof-reader to have a second look at
    the typed manuscript. Finally, I want to thank Chip Coakley for
    the gracious and favorable words that he has said about my book
    as a whole. In my attempt to clarify my position--an unpleasant
    task--I trust that I have not mis- interpreted him.</p>

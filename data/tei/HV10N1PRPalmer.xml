         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P1"/>[1] The
    legend of Mar Qardagh is a Syriac text probably written around
    600 C.E. at Arbela, modern Irbīl in northern Iraq. It
    is set in the same place some two hundred and fifty years
    earlier, when the hero, Qardagh, was stoned to death as a
    consequence of his anti-Zoroastrian activities. Emphasis
    is laid on the patriotism of Qardagh, a commander of troops in
    a zone bordering on the Christian Roman Empire; his conversion
    to Christianity did not make him sympathize with the enemies of
    the Sasanian King of Kings and his rejection of his family and
    their Zoroastrian Faith did not lessen his determination to
    avenge his people when they were attacked by the
    Romans. Today Christians in the same region are sometimes
    suspected by Muslims of sympathizing with the Western Powers
    which recently invaded Iraq. In the sixth century there were
    many military confrontations between the Romans and the
    Sasanians, who claimed the whole territory once taken from the
    Parthians by Pompey an others and, earlier, from the
    Achaemenids by Alexander. In the first half of the seventh
    century, the frustrations of the Near East, for so long fought
    over by Romans and Persians, where brought to an end by an
    unexpected Arab invasion of both empires and the region which
    Garth Fowden has described as the Mountain Arena came to
    dominate both the Iranian plateau and (to some extent) the
    Mediterranean Basin. The legend of Mar Qardagh has a political
    message, as well as a religious one: being a Christian in the
    Church of the East is not the same as sympathizing with an
    Empire which proclaims the Christian Faith, nor is the adoption
    of the other-worldly values of the Gospel a justification for
    opting out of one’s own world, when it comes to defending
    the community into which one was born from external
    aggressors.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P2"/>[2] W. gives
    us a tolerably reliable English version of the legend of Mar
    Qardagh to set beside the Latin of Jean-Baptiste Abbeloos and
    the German of Hermann Feige, both published in 1890; he also
    gives us the first ever monograph on the legend. This is
    no Bollandist endeavour to eliminate historically suspect
    elements from the legend and so make it acceptable as history.
    This legend has no value, Paul Peeters had claimed,
    contradicting Theodor Nöldeke, as a source for the events
    it describes; and W. agrees with Peeters, though he admits
    Wiessner’s point (p. 117) that there may be a tenuous
    link with a fifth-century Sasanian governor called Qardagh the
    <hi rend="italic">nekōrgan</hi>, who (according to the correspondence of
    Barsauma of Nisibis) resolved a border dispute involving the
    raids of pro-Roman Arab tribes. The value of the legend to the
    historian is as a literary testament of its own time. The
    story of Mar Qardagh enables us to ‘breathe the climate
    of northern Iraq on the eve of the Islamic conquest’, the
    place and the time of its composition (p. 1, acknowledging
    Freya Stark as the source of the phrase ‘literature is a
    sort of climate which one breathes’).</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P3"/>[3] As a
    source for history of the Church of the East, the legend was
    studied, long after Nöldeke and Peeters, by two students
    of Syriac-speaking Christianity, Jean-Maurice Fiey and Gernot
    Wiessner; the former was most interested in historical
    geography, the latter in the Persian epic motifs which are the
    subject of W.’s second chapter. The late Sasanian
    Empire has been studied by specialists in Persian and Arabic,
    with some contributions by archaeologists. Among earlier
    authors only Wiessner had adduced the legend of Mar Qardagh as
    a source for this period; Walker claims that the Qardagh legend
    ‘provides new and unexpected evidence for this tradition
    [<hi rend="italic">i.e</hi>., the Iranian epic tradition] among the
    Christians of northern Iraq’ (p. 163). With this
    formula W. does scant justice to Wiessner’s
    contribution.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P4"/>[4] The
    legend contains a philosophical dialogue in the Greek style,
    the aim of which is to show that Zoroastrians make a
    categorical mistake in worshipping as eternal entities things
    which were made by the Creator of the Universe, such as the sun
    and the moon, fire and water, air and earth. This dialogue
    was translated into English by Philippe Gignoux in 2001, as W.
    acknowledges in a footnote on p. 28; one might have expected W.
    to justify the more important discrepancies between
    Gignoux’s translation and his own.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P5"/>[5]
    W.’s translation, Part I of his book, is placed on pp.
    19-69 after his introduction (pp. 1-18) and before the
    interesting selection of photographs with instructive captions
    (pp. 73-83) and Part II, consisting of five chapters and an
    Epilogue (pp. 85-285).  Chapters 1-3, on ‘The Church
    of the East and the Hagiography of the Persian Martyrs’,
    ‘ “We rejoice in your heroic deeds!”
    Christian heroism and Sasanian epic tradition’ and
    ‘Refuting the eternity of the stars: philosophy between
    Byzantium and late antique Iraq’ have been touched on in
    the preceding paragraphs. We turn now to the rest of Part
    II.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P6"/>[6] Chapter
    4, on ‘Conversion and the family in the <hi rend="italic">Acts</hi> of
    the Persian Martyrs’, contains what is perhaps the most
    original insight of this monograph. W. notes that the
    <hi rend="italic">Acts</hi> of the earliest Sasanian martyrs ‘typically
    emphasize the solidarity of Christian families, especially the
    affective bonds between mothers and their sons’, whereas
    those of the late Sasanian martyrs tend to focus on ‘the
    persecution of the daughters and wives of vociferously
    “pagan” families’, though they
    ‘include, more often than not, scenes of
    reconciliation’ (p. 244f.). ‘The Qardagh
    legend presents, by comparison, an utterly uncompromising view
    of Christian ascetic heroism’ (p. 245). What is not
    altogether satisfactory is W.’s explanation of these
    literary trends and, in particular, of the unique status which
    he claims for his text.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P7"/>[7] Chapter
    5, on ‘Remembering Mar Qardagh: the origins and evolution
    of an East-Syrian martyr-cult’. Here W., while regretting
    ‘the badly underdeveloped state of Christian archaeology
    in former Sasanian lands’, pays tribute to the pioneering
    work of Fiey on the cults of the East Syrian saints and martyrs
    (p. 248), but remarks on how few other studies there have been.
    He tends to believe, though admitting that specific proof of
    continuity has yet to be excavated, that the annual market at
    Melqi, outside the walls of Arbela, attested by the legend of
    Mar Qardagh, is of pre-Christian origin and that its religious
    focus in earlier times was the cult of the goddess Ishtar. This
    goddess, whose statue may have been moved out every two years
    from her primary temple in the city of Arbela to Milqia (a name
    very like that of Melqi) outside the walls for the duration of
    her festival, has a warlike aspect (p. 251), but little else in
    common with the saint. The evidence is a
    ‘persuasive’ reconstruction by A. Livingstone of a
    fragmentary text. Melqi plays a prominent part in the
    story of Qardagh’s life and it was there that his
    monastery was later situated, presumably on the ruins of the
    church—no need, surely, to distinguish between the
    ‘great and handsome church’ in §98 of B and
    that in the corresponding section of the Mosul
    MS—mentioned in the last paragraph of the text.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P8"/>[8] On p.
    267 W. points out that the main stream of the West-Syrian
    tradition ignores Qardagh, although he was commemorated in the
    fourteenth-century calendar of Tur ‘Abdin.  In this
    connection it is worth remarking that Tur ‘Abdin is a
    plateau which includes the northern slopes of Mount
    Izlo/Izlā, on the southern slopes of which several
    monasteries existed which belonged to the Church of the
    East. This ridge had once been the frontier between the
    Roman (Tur ‘Abdin) and Persian Empires, a fact ignored in
    Map 2 on p. 4, which, like most other maps of the Roman
    frontiers, places the greater part of Tur ‘Abdin in
    Sasanian territory. Far be it from me to suggest that my
    book, <hi rend="italic">Monk and mason on the Tigris frontier: the early
    history of Tur ‘Abdin</hi> (University of Cambridge
    Oriental Publications, 39; Cambridge University Press,
    Cambridge, 1990) ought to be included in the sizeable
    bibliography of modern scholarship (29 pages); but that is
    where the relevant geographical evidence is
    collected. That there was, throughout the centuries,
    intellectual exchange between West-Syrian and East-Syrian monks
    living in close proximity to one another in this remote and
    agricultural region could be assumed, if it had not been
    demonstrated (which, I think, it has). This route for the
    transmission of the ideas of John Philoponus from West-Syrian
    circles (in which, for doctrinal reasons, he was favoured) to
    the Church of the East (where they are found, unexpectedly, in
    the legend of Qardagh) might perhaps be added to those
    enumerated in n. 150 on p. 203.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P9"/>[9] The
    conclusions of the several chapters are resumed in the
    Epilogue, where W. also suggests that the revival of the cult
    of Mar Qardagh at Alqoš after the First World War should
    be connected with the continuing tendency in the Church of the
    East (and to a lesser extent among Syrian Christians generally)
    to bolster the identity of a small ethnic group by reference to
    the past glories of the Assyrian Empire (p. 285). Already
    in the fourteenth century Rabban Saliba of Hah, the Syrian
    Orthodox compiler of the calendar cited in my last paragraph,
    highlighted this ‘nationalistic’ association in his
    brief entry: ‘Mar Qardagh of the
    <hi rend="italic">genso/gensā</hi> of Sennacherib, who was crowned on a
    Friday.’ The Syriac word <hi rend="italic">gensā</hi> can
    mean family or nation; this recalls §3 of the legend,
    where we read (in W.’s translation, p. 20): ‘Now
    holy Mar Qardagh was from a great people (<hi rend="italic">gensā</hi>)
    from the stock of the kingdom of the Assyrians
    (<hi rend="italic">’tōrāyē</hi>). His father was
    descended from the renowned lineage of the house of Nimrod, and
    his mother from the renowned lineage of the house of
    Sennacherib.’</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P10"/>[10] The
    beauty of the presentation is unfortunately let down by the
    shortcomings of the proofreading, particularly in the
    transcription of Syriac: I counted more than a hundred
    misspellings. The translation is also marred by a number
    of errors. Students of Christian architecture need to know that
    the word translated as ‘vaulted chancels’ in
    §69 (p. 69) is not a plural, but a transcription of the
    Greek κογχη, meaning
    ‘apse’; and students of philosophy should compare
    all the existing translations of the dialogue on creatures, as
    the following short extract from §17 (p. 28 f.) shows:</p>
         <p> ‘The blessed one said to him,
    “Do you not worship the sun and the moon, fire and water,
    air and earth, and call them gods and goddesses?”</p>
         <p>‘Qardagh said to him, “Yes, I
    worship them because these things are eternal entities and have
    not been made [this should be: and no creatures; the Syriac is
    <hi rend="italic">w-law ‘bīdē</hi>, not <hi rend="italic">w-law
    ‘bīdīn</hi>].”</p>
         <p>‘The blessed one said to him,
    “Now from what have you deduced that the luminaries are
    eternal entities and have not been made [see above]?”</p>
         <p>‘Qardagh said to him, “From their
    constant course and because of the [var. B] immutability [B
    reads ‘mutability’; the reading
    ‘immutability’ comes from A!] of their nature, and
    from the fact that they endure [Syriac: <hi rend="italic">mkatrīn</hi>,
    which is ‘abide’] by the strength of their nature
    and are not changed like other things, and are set on high
    above [the conjunction <hi rend="italic">w-</hi> is here strongly
    adversative; translate: ‘<!--<u>-->but<!--</u>--> are set on
    high’].” ’</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P11"/>[11] In
    §18 (p. 29) the word <hi rend="italic">qāpsīn/qāpes</hi>
    is translated first as ‘store up [their warmth]’,
    then as ‘restrain [its rays]’; the former
    translation is inadmissible. I found as many mistakes on
    each of the following pages of the dialogue. On p. 30
    ‘they also are not alive’ should be ‘they are
    not even alive’, as in l. 4 f. of the same section (p.
    29). In §19, l. 2, ‘greater’ should be
    ‘to a greater degree’; in l. 5, ‘organs of
    the body: the brain <hi rend="italic">etc</hi>.’ should be
    ‘organs of the body, such as the brain
    <hi rend="italic">etc</hi>.’; in l. 8, ‘parts’ should be
    ‘things’; in l. 9, ‘in’ should be
    ‘of’; in l. 10 f. ‘the whole world would be
    destroyed’ should be ‘that would entail the
    destruction of the whole world’; in l. 11,
    ‘bond’ should be ‘girdle’; in l. 13,
    ‘plants’ should be ‘roots’. On p.
    31 (§20), l. 1, the word ‘qualities’ has been
    supplied by the translator and
    <hi rend="italic">mārānā’īt</hi> should be
    ‘in a sovereign manner’, not ‘chiefly’;
    in. l. 2, ‘receive’ should be ‘have
    received’; in l. 4 <hi rend="italic">metnged</hi> should be translated
    ‘is afflicted’, not ‘is blinded’, and
    ‘suffers’ should be ‘suffers harm to his
    sight’; in l. 10 ‘have been made’ should be
    ‘creatures’ (see above) or ‘created
    entities’, as in l. 13; in l. 15, ‘rout’
    should be ‘defeat’; in l. 16,
    ‘dissolved’ should be ‘liquefied’ and
    the word ‘even’ should be omitted; in l. 17,
    ‘vanishes’ should be ‘evaporates’; in
    l. 19, ‘heated’ should be ‘ignited’ and
    ‘by the luminaries’ should be ‘by fire’
    (although this involves emending the text); in l. 20,
    ‘each of them’ should be followed by
    ‘singly’ and ‘even of’ should be
    ‘including’.  In n. 58 on p. 31 W. writes:
    ‘Literally “has come into being”
    (<hi rend="italic">hwāyā hū</hi>).’ This should be:
    ‘Literally: “is a contingent being”
    (<hi rend="italic">hwāyā-[h]w</hi>).’ The corrections
    necessary on these three pages suffice to show that no
    scholarly argument can be based solely on this translation.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P12"/>[12] One
    might also have hoped to see more sensitivity to the way the
    author plays on Syriac words, particularly on the word
    <hi rend="italic">mšī<hi rend="u">h</hi>ā</hi>
    ‘Messiah’, which has almost the same appearance on
    the page as <hi rend="italic">mšaynā</hi>
    ‘domesticated’, from <hi rend="italic">šayyen</hi>
    ‘he pacified’ (see p. 50, l. 1: ‘From when I
    put on Christ, the peace of the world, I did not want of my own
    volition to clothe myself in the rage of battles’), while
    the root <hi rend="italic">mšah</hi> means both ‘anoint’
    and ‘measure’ (see p. 22, l. 7:
    ‘intemperate’ =
    ‘unchristened’). By no means all allusions to
    the Bible are noticed; for example, the child Samuel also said,
    ‘Here I am!’ when he heard his name called by a
    supernatural being in the night (p. 23).</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P13"/>[13] If
    one is not too pedantic, though, this book is enjoyable and
    instructive to read. It certainly gives a more panoramic
    view than any previous study of the legend, with more
    suggestive insights and more abundant documentation, though
    perhaps the contribution of Wiessner to the conception of
    Chapter 2 might have been more generously
    acknowledged.</p>_______<lb/>

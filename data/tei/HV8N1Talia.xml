            <p>Celebrating a joyous occasion with a poem
    is an ancient and honored tradition among the ancient Semites.
    This felicitous ode is composed by this writer in honor of Fr.
    Sidney Griffith, Professor of Semitics at the Catholic
    University of America on the occasion of his festschrift
    presentation. The language of this
    “soġīt<hi rend="sup">h</hi>ā” is the Neo-Aramaic dialect of
    the plains of Mosul (ancient Nineva), northern Iraq. More
    especially, it is the dialect of the town of Tel-Kape, 18 miles
    north of the city. Various Neo-Aramaic dialects are still
    spoken in Iraq, Iran, Syria and Turkey. Their tomorrow is
    uncertain. Historical and political changes have compromised
    the future of these small Christian communities whose mother
    tongue is Neo-Aramaic.</p>

            <anchor corresp="P1"/>[1] The
    genesis of this “soġīt<hi rend="sup">h</hi>ā<note place="foot" xml:id="FN1" n="1">
                    <p rend="footnote text">
             The word soġīt<hi rend="sup">h</hi>ā is used here not in the classical
    Syriac mode but only in its aesthetic acclamation and
    versification. Since this word is a Syriac appellation for an
    occasional poem that extols and praises a person or an event
    – Saint Ephraim being the exemplar of this style –
    we have elected to give it this rubric. Given the spirit of
    this occasion the poem is presented hereby as a
    “soġīt<hi rend="sup">h</hi>ā”
         </p>
                </note>” was the presentation of a
    festschrift<note place="foot" xml:id="FN2" n="2">
                    <p rend="footnote text">
             The venue for this presentation was a reception
    given by Beth Mardutho: the Syriac Institute, at the closing of
    the Fourth North American Syriac Symposium, held at Princeton
    Theological Seminary, July 9-12, 2003. This was, indeed, a most
    propitious and auspicious occasion to make this presentation.
    This writer is grateful to Dr. George Kiraz, President of Beth
    Marduth: the Syriac Institute, for graciously accepting this
    felicitous poem for publication in <hi rend="italic">Hugoye</hi>.
         </p>
                </note> to Fr. Sidney Griffith, Professor of Semitic
    languages at the Catholic University of America. Dr. Monica
    Blanchard, of the Institute of Christian Oriental Research at
    the university, kindly invited this writer to preface the
    presentation with an introduction<note place="foot" xml:id="FN3" n="3">
                    <p rend="footnote text">
             This writer extends his deep appreciation to Dr.
    Monica Blanchard for her gracious invitation to make the
    introductory remarks before the presentation of the festschrift
    to Professor Griffith and for including it in the festschrift
    publication.
         </p>
                </note>. It was, indeed an honor and
    a privilege to do so. Professor Griffith has been a colleague
    and a friend for more than three decades.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P2"/>[2] Scholars
    and laymen of Syriac studies and Christian Arabic literature
    are well apprised of Professor Griffith’s contribution in
    these two fields. His erudition in the field of early Christian
    studies, especially of the Syrian Church, has deepened our
    understanding and appreciation of its ecclesiastical and
    literary heritage, as well as bringing to light opaque
    theological and doctrinal developments of the Christian Orient.
    His research in the field of Christian-Moslem dialogue in the
    formative years of Islam has expanded our understanding of the
    nature of this intellectual interlocution that took place
    between these two religions.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P3"/>[3] But his
    examination of these two disciplines is appreciated not only
    for its intellectual rigor and perspicacity but also for
    bringing hope and heartening to those who belong to the Syrian
    Church. We, whose mother tongue is Neo-Aramaic and whose
    liturgical language is still sung in that mellifluous,
    classical Syriac<note place="foot" xml:id="FN4" n="4">
                    <p rend="footnote text">
             Churches using the classical Syriac in their
    liturgy are: the Assyrian Church of the East, Chaldean,
    Maronite, Syro-Malabar, Syro-Malankar, Syrian Catholic and
    Syrian Orthodox.
         </p>
                </note>, irrespective of church affiliation, see in his
    chrestomathy a consolation and a catharsis. The future of this
    church in its native land is, sad to say, very dim, perhaps in
    its twilight. In consequence of his enlarging the horizon of
    Syriac studies, the Syrian Church, in all of its denominations,
    is now engaged in an ecumenical dialogue with the Western
    churches, and in an inter-denominational one. This new dialogue
    has brought a prospect of an ecclesiastical harmony and the
    promise of a theological concord within the Syrian Church. His
    love for this Oriental Church, seen through his copious
    writings, has brought hope that this ancient church, which has
    produced so many luminaries from Saint Ephraim to Aphrahat, the
    Persian Sage, will be sustained and survive in its motherland.
    Scholars of Syriac and Christian Arabic, among them Professor
    Griffith, are a perpetual fount of assurance. This church,
    whose language was spoken by our Lord, is endeavoring not to
    disappear in its homeland.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P4"/>[4] On such
    an occasion the expected thing is to proffer salutary words in
    praise of the honoree. So when Dr. Blanchard invited this
    writer to preface the presentation the first instinct was to
    make a felicitous sentiment to the gathering at this
    reception<note place="foot" xml:id="FN5" n="5">
                    <p rend="footnote text">
             See above, footnote no. 2.
         </p>
                </note>. However, after some rumination on the nature of
    the remarks, and it was obvious what they should be, thoughts
    turned to the ancient Semites, by asking, “What would
    they do?” Historically, on such an occasion the subject
    of the celebration would be feted with a poem, a
    soġīt<hi rend="sup">h</hi>ā or a
    tešbo<!--<u>-->h<!--</u>-->tā, if you please. This tradition has
    been an honored one among the ancient Semites and is still
    practiced by their modern descendents. It was in this spirit
    that this writer elected to compose a poem celebrating the
    presentation of a festschrift to Professor Griffith. It is
    presented here as a token of deep respect and affection<note place="foot" xml:id="FN6" n="6">
                    <p rend="footnote text">
             Owing to the restriction of time at this reception
    this writer read a much shorter version of this poesy. The full
    text is presented here, together with an introduction and a
    bibliography.
         </p>
                </note>. But it is
    not only this writer who is presenting this poem on this
    special occasion. For it is also the Syrian Church, with its
    multi-denominational communicants, its churches, monuments,
    monasteries and convents, who are partaking in this festive
    presentation. They all sing, “Thank you for being a
    Ru<!--<u>-->h<!--</u>-->ā Bassimtā 'u Bēt
    Yulpānā.”</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P5"/>[5] The poem
    is written in the Neo-Aramaic dialects of the villages and
    hamlets of the plains of Mosul (ancient Nineva), of northern
    Iraq. Specifically, it is the dialect of the town of
    Tel-Kape<note place="foot" xml:id="FN7" n="7">
                    <p rend="footnote text">
             The Iraqi census of 1961 showed a population of
    7307, all of them belonging to the Chaldean Catholic rite.
    Today, due to economic reasons, internal conflicts and three
    international wars, the number is around 3000, one fifth of
    them Moslems.
         </p>
                </note>, situated eighteen miles north of Mosul. The
    vernacular of this area, called Surath (i.e. Syriac), is one of
    a large sub-group of dialects historically referred to as
    Neo-Aramaic. For the student of Semitic philology these
    dialects are of paramount importance, for each dialect exhibits
    its own peculiarities, linguistic, historical and
    socio-cultural. And while some research has been done in these
    dialects, very little study has been done on their relationship
    to Aramaic and classical Syriac. Furthermore, political and
    religious reasons have hindered any serious field research in
    the different dialects. Most of the research has centered on a
    descriptive grammar<note place="foot" xml:id="FN8" n="8">
                    <p rend="footnote text">
             Due to the difficulty of doing linguistic field
    work in the villages of these dialects, most of the research
    for the descriptive grammar is done through the use of an
    “informant,” usually far away from the geographical
    area. Clearly, the further away from these towns the less
    chance of the accurate linguistic information reaching the
    researcher.
         </p>
                </note> of a particular geographical area or a
    village. A serious philological study of these dialects is
    still the hope of students of Syriac.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P6"/>[6] In the
    last fifty years these dialects have been the recipients of
    many foreign words, thus greatly diluting the historical
    integrity of the Neo-Aramaic. Furthermore, immigration has
    emptied many of the villages that speak Neo-Aramaic of their
    inhabitants. Hence there is an urgent need to study these
    dialects. Their survival, like the presence of Christianity in
    its land of birth, is at stake.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P7"/>[7] The
    number of those speaking the different dialects of Neo-Aramaic
    has been declining since the first decade of the twentieth
    century. Two major events have had a profound effect on these
    dialects and those who speak them. The first one was the
    genocide against the Christians of the Ottoman Empire,
    specifically the Armenians and Syrian Christians. While the
    former suffered the most, the latter<note place="foot" xml:id="FN9" n="9">
                    <p rend="footnote text">
             The Neo-Aramaic speaking communities that
    experienced the many massacres between 1910-25 were situated in
    <!--<u>-->T<!--</u>-->ūr <hi rend="sup">c</hi>Abdīn
    and Mardin (Turkey), and Iraqi Kurdistan and Mosul (Iraq). They
    included Assyrians, Chaldeans, Syrian Catholics and Syrian
    Orthodox.
         </p>
                </note> suffered enough casualties
    that it caused the second catastrophic event. This was the
    emigration from areas where the many massacres took place,
    resulting in a depopulation of most villages of their Christian
    communities. Most of the immigrants were dispersed throughout
    the Arab world, with a large number emigrating to the West,
    especially the USA. The political and religious unrest of the
    last fifty years has accelerated this migration. Among
    immigrants whose native language is Neo-Aramaic, there is a
    tendency to marginalize it since the language of their adopted
    country is the medium of communication. For the first
    generation of these immigrants, Neo-Aramaic has become an
    anachronism. Its only relevance to them is the fact that it is
    related to classical Syriac, the liturgical language of their
    respective churches.</p>

    Historically Neo-Aramaic has been an oral vernacular. It has
    not been formally taught in schools, and has produced a limited
    religious and secular literature. There have been some printed
    liturgical compositions, with distribution limited to priests
    and deacons. Some occasional pieces are published in religious
    publications, such as festal poems, eulogies or specific
    communal commemorations. Early in this century there were few
    attempts to publish newspapers but they did not come to
    fruition. The one Neo-Aramaic speaking community that has
    produced a substantial literature is the Chaldean town of
    Alkosh<note place="foot" xml:id="FN11" n="11">

    Urmia, in Iran. The latter was far more successful in producing
    a fairly extensive and varied literature, including newspapers
    and books<note place="foot" xml:id="FN12" n="12">

                </note>. Given the occasional theme of this paper no
    attempt is made to discuss the descriptive grammar of this
    Neo-Aramaic vernacular, neither have we chosen to discuss the
    historical relationship to classical Syriac. Hopefully, such a
    work will be presented at a different venue. The poem is
    presented herewith in the Syriac script, following as much as
    possible a phonetic transcription. However, where a word has
    gone through only a minor consonantal shift, such as
    <hi rend="italic">“ara”</hi> (earth) for classical
    “<hi rend="italic">ar<hi rend="sup">c</hi>a</hi>” we
    have given the classical and not the vernacular. Nevertheless
    in the transliteration we have been faithful to the phonetics
    of the vernacular in order to give the reader a full
    appreciation for the orthographic and syntactical shift from
    classical Syriac to this dialect of Neo-Aramaic. The English
    translation mirrors the style and spirit of the Neo-Aramaic of
    the poem. It is the Neo-Aramaic (i.e. vernacular Syriac) which
    this writer learned at home and from the literati in this
    dialect, in Iraq and the United States.</p>

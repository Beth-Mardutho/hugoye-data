                <p xml:lang="en">The innovative contributions and careful methods of this
                    volume are apparent from the very first page—indeed, they are present in the
                    subtitle of the volume itself. Reflecting on the use of the term “intersections” to
                    describe the varied points of connection, convergence, and divergence central to the
                    studies contained here, the editors say that, “[t]his term is purposefully general
                    so as to allow room for various modes of contact, interaction, etc., without biasing
                    the conversation with terminol-ogical preconceptions from the outset” (Butts and
                    Gross, p. 1). This careful framing has paid dividends for the editors. The studies
                    of this volume are richly varied, both in terms of subject matter and methodology;
                    they range from critical reflections on historiographical and literary trends
                    (Gross, pp. 121–144; Münz-Manor, pp. 231–254) to narrower studies of particular
                    authors and texts, set in richly understood, and in some cases newly redescribed,
                    contexts (Cohen, pp. 89–102; Young, pp. 321–326). This variation provides a valuable
                    snapshot into an academic question of long standing (just how much <hi rend="italic"
                        >did</hi> Jews and Syriac Christians interact?), revealing a terrain of answers
                    whose variety tells the reader as much about the history and background of the field
                    as it does about the current multiplicity of methods and disciplines.</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">While the studies themselves are arranged alphabetically by
                    author, the editors indicate that there are two main types of interaction present in
                    the contacts between Jews and Syriac Christians studied here, and that these help us
                    to categorize the studies. These are explicit and implicit interactions: texts where
                    “others” are named explicitly, and texts where they are merely suggested (Butts and
                    Gross, p. 2). Even with this distinction named, however, the lines between them lay
                    blurred: the editors point out that figures like Ephrem are the subject of studies
                    which attempt to find his implicit, unnamed connections to Judaism (such as in his
                    exegesis), as well as analyses of his more explicit attacks against Jews. A
                    comprehensive study of Ephrem and his relationship to Judaism, then, involves both. </p>
                <p xml:lang="en">Explicit references to Jews are much rarer than materials which
                    suggest an implicit connection. Becker (47–66), Cohen (89–102), Moss (207–229),
                    Rubenstein (256–279), and Walters (291–319) mostly work with these sorts of texts in
                    the present volume. In order to study these texts in context, of course, all of
                    these authors are attentive to implicit assumptions and language connecting authors
                    and their others: in a way, this volume is a testament to just how critical it is to
                    consider questions of othering, identity, and influence holistically, and from a
                    variety of angles. The broader, more methodologically focused pieces, which treat a
                    variety of sources at once, are some of the most successful examples of this:
                    Becker, Gross, Herman, Kalmin, Koltun-Fromm, Münz-Manor, and Ruben-stein all display
                    deft hands and insightful readings of sources that are read together rarely, and
                    equally rarely with such care.</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">The two types of connections that the editors delineate
                    reflect, in their isolated expressions, two different sets of historical assumptions
                    and historiographical trends. These can heuristically be seen as attempting to
                    reconstruct a historical reality, on the one hand, and as analyzing rhetoric, on the
                    other. Another strength of the pieces herein, however, is that they all combine
                    these methods, to some degree. They foreground the rhetoric of the sources, trying
                    first to understand the work that the written material itself is trying to
                    accomplish, and only then to turn a lens onto the world that might be reconstructed,
                    posited, and formed outside of the text itself. These techniques are certainly not
                    unique to Syriac studies, or even the question of connection between Jews and Syriac
                    Christians, but the way they appear in this edited volume provides a constructive
                    terrain for analysis. </p>
                <p xml:lang="en">Michal Bar Asher-Siegal, for example, follows an argument by
                    Shlomo Naeh that a uniquely Syriac understanding of the word <hi rend="italic"
                        >herutā</hi> can help us make sense of a particular narrative in rabbinic
                    literature. While none of the materials she examines explicitly name, describe, or
                    engage a religious other, by bringing different sources together, Bar Asher-Siegal
                    writes a textured account of how narratives and tropes from Christian monastic
                    literature might be incorporated in rabbinic texts. Sergey Minov asks a similar set
                    of questions in “Staring Down a Laundress,” while Christian Stadel introduces an
                    entirely new category of shared texts between Jewish and Syriac worlds: that of
                    Judaeo-Syriac itself. Simcha Gross troubles some of these categories even further,
                    calling into question the generally accepted orthodoxy of the Jewish origins of
                    Syriac Christianity, an argument whose ramifications will be felt for years to come.
                    We gain insight into boundaries both porous and rigid, and the great variety of
                    manners in which power and knowledge might flow between them. </p>
                <p xml:lang="en">One of this volume’s great strengths, in addition to the
                    breadth and variety visible in the individual contributions, is the effective
                    combination of more programmatic, theoretically oriented pieces, and more sharply
                    focused analyses. Rather than simply a map of the “way forward,” or a series of
                    studies that claim to use new and better methods, <hi rend="italic">Jews and Syriac
                        Christians</hi> is both the map, and the terrain represented therein. It is
                    undoubtedly rare for a volume to achieve this so successfully, but by including, for
                    example, Becker’s “Syriac Anti-Judaism: Polemic and Internal Critique” alongside
                    Walters’ “Anti-Jewish Rhetoric and Christian Identity in Aphrahat’s <hi
                        rend="italic">Demonstrations</hi>,” readers gain understanding of not only the
                    particular problems, issues, and questions surrounding individ-ual authors, but also
                    the broader stakes and perspectives in how we frame and ask our questions. Walters
                    places Aphrahat’s anti-Judaism into the broader context of Syriac Christian
                    anti-Judaism more generally; at the same time, Becker differentiates the presence of
                    anti-Judaism as internal critique from the more violent legacies of medieval Europe.
                    The two together suggest that there are real, material legacies of late ancient
                    group formation; and, additionally, they show that the lines that demarcate “self”
                    and “other” are, even in ancient polemical texts, much more difficult to navigate
                    than we often assume. This is but one example of how the volume successfully
                    sharpens the study of interactions between Jews and Syriac Christians, and expands
                    the questions scholars ask.</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">While some of the questions asked in <hi rend="italic">Jews and
                    Syriac Christians</hi> have a long history in scholarship, and some of the texts
                    analyzed are well known, taken as a whole, this volume marks out new terrain, and
                    even begins investigating it. While it was not intended as an introductory volume to
                    the interactions between Jews and Syriac Christians in late antiquity, it would
                    serve that purpose admirably, and any serious scholar of either field would be well
                    served to engage the arguments herein. </p>

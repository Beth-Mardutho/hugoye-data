            <anchor corresp="P1"/>[1] Stephen
    Davis’ recent book, <hi rend="italic">The Cult of St. Thecla: a
    Tradition of Women’s Piety in Late Antiquity</hi>, is an
    important and substantial contribution to our study of the cult
    of saints in ancient Christianity, and further, to our
    reconstruction of women’s piety during the late antique
    period.  The book marks an exciting shift in the treatment
    of saints:  turning our attention from multivalent
    presentations of the saint herself, to focus on the piety of
    those ancient Christians who were her devotees.  Davis
    brings together the great array of types of evidence that
    attest to devotion to the saint, beginning with an astute
    discussion of the second century apocryphal <hi rend="italic">Acts of Paul
    and Thecla</hi> that gave rise to the cult itself.  
    From there, he leads us through a rich gathering of literary
    texts, including variations, translations, expansions of and
    additions to the apocryphal story;  other types of
    literary attestations to Thecla found in sermons, letters, the
    <hi rend="italic">vitae</hi> of other saints, or other narrative texts; 
    inscriptions and epigraphical data containing prayers to Thecla
    or indicating persons bearing her name;  pilgrim
    ampullae,  combs and other personal items inscribed or
    decorated with her image;  wall paintings, textiles,
    lamps, and grave stelae depicting the saint;  and shrines
    dedicated to her veneration.  The breadth of evidence,
    both literary and material, for devotion to Thecla is indeed
    impressive. </p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P2"/>[2] Insofar
    as scholars have looked at this evidence previously, it has
    most often been dealt with in discrete contexts.  Pilgrim
    flasks bearing Thecla’s image, for example, have been
    studied in the context of pilgrimage art and activity in late
    antiquity.  Davis’ intent, however, is not simply to
    document the saint’s popularity across the huge
    geographical expanse of the ancient Christian world—to
    some extent this has been done before.  Instead, his
    purpose is to reconstruct the piety of the saint’s
    devotees:  the practices, rituals, expressions, values,
    institutions, traditions, and artifacts by which ancient
    Christians articulated and enacted veneration to St.
    Thecla.  In this effort, Davis produces a fascinating
    picture of a cult that seems to have been especially important
    for women, both in popularity and in social and religious
    consequences.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P3"/>[3] Davis
    sets out to examine the cult of St. Thecla in two specific (but
    highly important) geographical locations, Asia Minor and
    Egypt.  Asia Minor might be considered the "epicenter" of
    the cult, for Thecla’s shrine at Seleucia was one of the
    most popular pilgrim sites of the late antique and early
    Byzantine periods.  Its extensive archaeological remains
    are enhanced by literary evidence of its activity, shown not
    only in the elaborate miracle collection associated with it but
    also, most famously, by the account the fourth century pilgrim
    Egeria provides of her visit there in the 380s.  Combining
    these materials allows Davis to suggest the particular pattern
    of devotional activity followed by pilgrims who visited the
    shrine.  The liturgical structuring of the pilgrim’s
    visit, its material framing by the buildings that defined the
    shrine within its landscape of mountain, rock, and spring, and
    the connections drawn between the saint’s second century
    legend and later miracle accounts from the shrine all served to
    shape the pilgrim’s expectations and experiences during a
    visit.  Whether articulated in narrative form (as in
    Egeria’s diary) or through devotional artifact (a flask
    of holy oil carried away as a sacred memento), the
    pilgrim’s participation in Thecla’s cult was always
    a carefully contextualized involvement—the joining of an
    individual’s experience to that of larger collective
    devotion within the life of the church.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P4"/>[4] If the
    evidence from Asia Minor might be taken as somehow normative
    for the cult of St. Thecla in late antiquity, that from Egypt
    shows us how the cult could flourish in a different
    region.  Indeed, it flourished to such an extent that it
    eventually established its own form indigenous to that
    area.  Here Davis presents genuinely fresh material. 
    From Athanasius’ letters he culls evidence for special
    devotion to Thecla among the community of Alexandria’s
    consecrated virgins.  Traveling into the scattered civic
    communities of Egypt’s sprawling deserts, he finds a
    wealth of pilgrim flasks, wall paintings and grave stelae
    attesting not only to the veneration of Thecla, but further to
    important interactions between her cult and those for St. Menas
    and others.  Davis’ collection of this material
    evidence is one of the best features of the book.  These
    traces allow him to posit a context in which to see Coptic
    legends presenting a different, localized Egyptian Thecla as
    something more than disconnected or derivative developments of
    the earlier Acts and miracle stories from Asia Minor.  For
    Davis reads these Coptic legends as the emergence of a Thecla
    cult indigenous to Egypt, expressing a devotion to the saint so
    widely shared among Christians of Egypt that they found a way
    to inscribe the saint’s story into their own history and
    landscape.  This section of the book is especially
    intriguing, with Davis’ reading of the hagiographical
    material particularly insightful.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P5"/>[5] Whether
    in Asia Minor or in Egypt, and whether working with narrative
    or material evidence, throughout his study Davis insists that
    the cult of St. Thecla consistently fostered certain values of
    particular significance for women.  Time and again,
    Thecla’s presentation in legend, image, or artifact
    celebrates the values of asceticism (virginity) and pilgrimage
    (itineracy), in terms that serve to empower women’s
    religious authority and to challenge their traditional social
    locations.  Davis notes repeatedly how the literary
    evidence in particular indicates the efforts of the
    ecclesiastical structure to curtail and domesticate the piety
    of Thecla devotion, whether through Athanasius’ direction
    of the activities of the Alexandrian virgins or the inclusion
    of married women among those who obtain miracles at
    Thecla’s shrine (here we find Thecla saving marriages by
    reconciling estranged spouses:  hardly the "happy ending"
    envisioned in most of the apocryphal acts of the
    apostles!).  The socially problematic portrayal of Thecla
    in her second century legend seems to have created immediate
    dilemmas regarding the status, roles, and activities of women
    in early Christian communities, as we know from
    Tertullian’s disgruntled complaints.  Davis is
    arguing that such challenge to the social order was continued
    within and through the very piety that characterized devotion
    to this saint.  For her devotees not only perpetuated the
    telling of her (socially disruptive) story, but further,
    themselves engaged in mimetic acts of devotion expressive of
    the same qualities.  Favoring virginity or chastity in
    marriage, often intent on religious travel (pilgrimage) that
    might defy adequate male supervision, Thecla’s late
    antique devotees were not always submissive to traditional
    institutional authorities, nor easily assimilated into those
    structures.  It would seem, Davis argues, that the
    (social) effects of Thecla’s story profoundly marked the
    lives of her devotees, for many generations.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P6"/>[6] Because
    Davis has produced such a rich study of the Thecla cult in two
    distinct regions, the book begs for more.  Evidence for
    devotion to Thecla in Syriac tradition, for example, if less
    extensive archaeologically than what remains in Egypt, is no
    less significant in the issues it raises (see the article in
    the present issue of Hugoye by Burris and Van Rompay). 
    Moreover, one would like to see how Davis’ model might be
    addressed to the cults of other saints.  Such explorations
    lie beyond the scope of this book, but not beyond the scope of
    its readers!  Davis has done a great service with this
    study.  May others respond in kind.</p>

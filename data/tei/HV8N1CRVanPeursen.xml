            <anchor corresp="P1"/>[1] From 1
    to 6 August 2004 the city of Leiden hosted the XVIIIth Congress
    of the International Organization for the Study of the Old
    Testament (IOSOT). Part of this congress was a seminar entitled
    'The Bible of Edessa: Towards a New English Translation of the
    Syriac Bible'. The conveners of this seminar were Bas ter Haar
    Romeny and Wido van Peursen. The project to prepare a new
    English translation of the Peshitta was launched in the late
    nineties by the Peshitta Institute, Leiden. The first seminar
    devoted to theoretical, practical and editorial questions
    involved in this project was held in 1999 (see <ref target="../Vol2No2/">Hugoye 2/2</ref> [1999].) The aim of the seminar at
    the IOSOT conference was to reconsider the editorial decisions
    that were the outcome of the first seminar and to reflect on
    the theoretical issues underlying the translation.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P2"/>[2] The
    programme of the seminar consisted of two parts. The first part
    contained three papers on the textual basis of the English
    translation, linguistic aspects of the translation, and the way
    in which the reception history should be accounted for in the
    annotations. The second part contained two papers by people who
    had already made much progress in their translation and could
    tell from experience what problems are encountered. This was
    followed by a general discussion, based on the article 'The New
    English Annotated Translation of the Syriac Bible (NEATSB):
    Retrospect and Prospect' by K.D. Jenner et al., which appeared
    in Aramaic Studies 2/1 (2004) 85-106.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P3"/>[3] Bas ter
    Haar Romeny presented the first lecture of the seminar. He
    discussed the textual basis of the English translation. In 1999
    it had been decided that the BTR text of the Leiden Peshitta
    edition would be the basis of the translation, 'though only in
    the perspective of a well-founded text-critical and
    text-historical evaluation'. At first sight this decision was
    an unequivocal choice to take the main text of the edition as
    the source of the English translation, but the added remark
    about the text-critical evaluation left open the possibility
    that variants containing text-critically preferable readings
    could end up in the main text, with the BTR readings given in
    an apparatus. Ter Haar Romeny argued for the latter option. The
    most important reasons in his argument were the fact that the
    Leiden edition is not a critical edition (its initiator P.A.H.
    de Boer emphasised over and again that the main text should
    only be consulted together with the critical apparatus) and the
    observation that the editors of the Peshitta volumes display
    different policies regarding variant readings to be included in
    the main text.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P4"/>[4] The
    second lecture, by Wido van Peursen, dealt with the linguistic
    issues of NEATSB. From the very start of the NEATSB project,
    those involved in it believed that linguistics should play a
    prominent role in the project. The main reason was the peculiar
    situation that NEATSB is a translation-of-a-translation, in
    which Syriac is both target language (of the Peshitta) and
    source language (of the English translation). Van Peursen's
    paper illustrated how linguistic considerations can contribute
    to the preparation of the translation, taking as an example
    linguistic and text-critical issues in the field of clause
    combination.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P5"/>[5] The
    third lecture, by David Taylor, focused on the commentary on
    the book of Psalms by Daniel of Salah. In the 1999 seminar it
    had been decided that 'significant information about the
    reception history' should be included in the annotations.
    Taylor discussed the information that the commentary by Daniel
    of Salah on the Psalms, the earliest Syriac commentary on this
    book (from 542 CE), can provide for establishing dated readings
    and developmental stages of the Peshitta text, and the
    information it gives about early Syriac interpretation.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P6"/>[6] David
    Shepherd presented the first paper in the second part of the
    seminar. In his translation of the Peshitta of Job he found a
    clear tendency to diverge from the word order found in the
    Hebrew text. In Job 2:5, for example, the Hebrew 'bone and
    flesh' has been translated in the Peshitta with 'flesh and
    bone'. This reversal of the word order occurs in other places
    as well and may be due to the fact that the translators were
    familiar with the expression 'flesh and bone' in the New
    Testament (Luke 24:39).</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P7"/>[7] Gill
    Greenberg, the NEATSB translator of Jeremiah, gave the second
    paper in this part of the seminar. The Massoretic Text of
    Jeremiah uses a number of words related to 'evil' and
    'wrongdoing'. The Peshitta employs another set of words for
    this semantic field. However, the correspondences between the
    Hebrew and the Syriac are very diverse and, it seems,
    inconsistent. This raises the question of what the English
    translator should do: should he or she feel free to render them
    with those English words for 'wrongdoing' that are most
    appropriate to the context, or be more consistent in the
    translation of the Syriac words.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P8"/>[8] Two
    other lectures during the IOSOT conference, although not
    scheduled in the NEATSB seminar, were devoted to the Peshitta
    as well. One was by Craig Morrison, who translates Samuel in
    the NEATSB project, and the other by Herry van Rooy, the NEATSB
    translator of Ezekiel. Morrison discussed the relationship of
    the Peshitta of 2 Samuel with 1 Chronicles. There are some
    indications that the translator or a later copyist of the
    Peshitta of 2 Samuel borrowed from either the Hebrew or Syriac
    text of 1 Chronicles. Because of the overall independent
    character of the Syriac translations of 2 Samuel and 1
    Chronicles, even in those cases where the Hebrew text is
    difficult, Morrison argued that the borrowing occurred not at
    the time of translation but during the transmission.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P9"/>[9] Herry
    van Rooy discussed the Peshitta of Ezekiel 1. His paper
    addressed three issues: inner-Syriac variation, the relation
    between the Peshitta and the Massoretic Text, and the relation
    between the Peshitta and the Septuagint. The Peshitta follows
    the Hebrew text rather closely and can be characterised as a
    'relatively verbatim translation', even in those cases where
    the Septuagint shows divergent readings.</p>

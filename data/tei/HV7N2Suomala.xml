         <div type="abstract">
            <p>In 1891, Isaac Hall published a Syriac
    dialogue that blends elements of Exod 19-34 in which Moses
    ascends Mt. Sinai to receive the Torah, and spends 40 days and
    nights with God. This dialogue between God and Moses
    incorporates legal and ethical issues, as well as explores
    issues of God’s origin and nature. The text seems to have
    no other counterparts in Syriac literature, but has parallels
    in four other manuscript traditions:  1) Arabic Christian,
    2) Ethiopian Christian and Falasha, 3) East African Muslim, and
    4) Spanish Muslim. This paper will explore those parallels, and
    investigate the possibility of a common source.</p>

         <lb/>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P1"/>[1] During
    the course of my dissertation research on Moses and God in
    dialogue in post-biblical literature,<ref target="#FN1">1</ref> I came upon a Syriac
    dialogue, “The Colloquy of Moses on Mount Sinai,”
    published by Isaac Hall.<ref target="#FN2">2</ref> The dialogue is set on Mt. Sinai
    and is loosely based on Exod 19-34. In this dialogue between
    Moses and God, Moses asks rather simple, straightforward
    questions. To each of the questions, God provides a response.
    Hall could not provide a date or setting for the text, although
    he speculated that it might have some connection to the
    Nestorian liturgical tradition. He notes that the text he
    received from a contact in Urmia in 1889 was part of a
    manuscript that also contained “The Story of Arsenius
    King of Egypt.” This manuscript, along with two others
    that contain “The Colloquy”, is held by the
    Houghton Library at Harvard University.<ref target="#FN3">3</ref>
         </p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P2"/>[2] As part
    of his description of “The Colloquy”, Hall points
    to the close connection between the Syriac and Arabic Christian
    manuscript tradition by noting the existence of three
    additional Karshuni versions.<ref target="#FN4">4</ref> Graf demonstrates that “The
    Colloquy” is in fact well attested in Christian Arabic
    traditions, particularly Karshuni, and he suggests that the
    material in these manuscripts has Syriac origins.<ref target="#FN5">5</ref> Most of the mss
    in this group are dated to the 16<hi rend="sup">th</hi> and
    17<hi rend="sup">th</hi> centuries although there are at least four can
    be dated to the 15<hi rend="sup">th</hi> century. One of the mss is
    dated as late as the 19<hi rend="sup">th</hi> century.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P3"/>[3] The
    Syriac “Colloquy”, with respect to both form and
    content has no clear parallels within the Syriac literary
    tradition,<ref target="#FN6">6</ref> the wider Christian tradition,<ref target="#FN7">7</ref> or even the
    classical Islamic tradition. At first glance, it would appear
    that there are parallels between “The Colloquy” and
    the numerous dialogues between Moses and God in rabbinic
    literature. However, upon closer examination, aside from the
    dialogue form, the content and the style of “The
    Colloquy” does not correspond to any of the rabbinic
    dialogues.<ref target="#FN8">8</ref>
         </p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P4"/>[4] Is this
    text simply an anomaly? How can we account for it, given the
    lack of precedent in Jewish, Christian and Muslim literature?
    Interestingly, there are parallels, but not necessarily where
    one might expect to find them. In addition to the Syriac
    Christian manuscripts (including those in Arabic), dialogue
    texts with similar content and structure are found among: 1)
    Ethiopian Christians and Jews (Falashas), 2) Muslims of
    Mozambique (or perhaps Kenya), and 3) Spanish Muslims.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P5"/>[5] Steven
    Kaplan has recently connected this Syriac text to both the
    Ethiopian Christian as well as Falasha traditions. He has
    published a translation of the Ge’ez version, <hi rend="italic">Nagara
    Muse</hi>, of this dialogue, part of the Falasha corpus of
    literature which was received from the Ethiopian church with
    very few revisions. <ref target="#FN9">9</ref> There are at least four
    manuscripts—three in the Faitlovich collection, and one
    in a private collection. The manuscripts include dates: two of
    them contain the years 1757/58 and one records 1754/55.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P6"/>[6] Another
    dialogue that appears connected to this group also originates
    in Africa. The Swahili <hi rend="italic">Epic of Moses (Utenzi wa Musa)</hi>
    is considered among the first literary works discovered in
    northern Mozambique. Tentatively dated to the late nineteenth
    century, the text may have been written in Kenya. It is fairly
    close in length to the Syriac and Ge’ez texts, about 330
    stanzas, and is written in the Utenzi poetic form. One of the
    three versions of this text found in a copy book by discovered
    by Prof. Eugeniusz Rzewuski of Warsaw University was translated
    by Jan Knappert.<ref target="#FN10">10</ref>
         </p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P7"/>[7] Not
    finding specific precursors in either the Christian or Jewish
    literary traditions, I turned to Islamic biblical legend and
    commentary. As it turns out, there is a rather substantial
    manuscript tradition of dialogue texts involving Moses and God
    in sixteenth century Spain. These texts form part of the body
    of <hi rend="italic">aljamiado</hi> and <hi rend="italic">morisco</hi>
    literature—material written or transmitted by Spanish
    Muslims in Spanish with Arabic characters. The
    <hi rend="italic">aljamiado</hi> period really only lasted for little more
    than a century, concluding in 1609, at which point a large
    portion of the population fled Spain for North Africa. These
    dialogues are dated not later than 1609, when the last of the
    <hi rend="italic">Moriscos</hi> fled Spain. In these manuscripts there are
    direct parallels to the Syriac, Ge’ez, and Swahili
    dialogues—both in form and in content—although
    theologically they are closer to the Swahili text. There are
    three manuscripts at la Real Academia de la Historia in Spain
    that contain these dialogues—Gay. T. 19, 8, and
    13.<ref target="#FN11">11</ref>
         </p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P8"/>[8] These
    dialogue texts are linked by form and content. The question and
    answer format or what in linguistic terms is called an
    adjacency pair (a completed verbal unit, i.e., a question and
    its answer, a request and its performance, a statement and a
    response) dominates each dialogue. In these dialogues, the
    central conversation partners are God and Moses, although
    characters such as Iblis and angels also make appearances and
    contribute to the dialogues.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P9"/>[9] With
    respect to content, the questions that Moses asks fall into
    three categories: 1) those that pertain to ethical, moral, and
    ritual issues, 2) those that reflect a desire to know more
    about the nature and origin of the Divine, and 3) those that
    pertain to final judgment and redemption. In the first
    category, each of the texts, to differing degrees, emphasizes
    care for the poor and the orphans, proper treatment of parents,
    burial rites and responsibilities, consistent prayer, avoiding
    anger, slander, oppression, bringing about peace, and honoring
    the neighbor. An example of concern about proper ritual occurs
    in each text when Moses asks God about a reward for the person
    who digs a grave:</p>
         <quote>
      Syriac<lb/>
      And Moses … said, “He that digs the grave of a
      departed brother believer, what is his reward? And God said
      to him, I will clothe him with a robe of the light of my
      divinity, and I will pardon him [his] sins.<ref target="#FN12">12</ref>
         </quote>
         <quote>
      Ge’ez<lb/>
      [Moses asks] What will you give to the one who digs a grave
      for his brother in the faith? [God responds] I will write his
      name in the Book of Life with the prophets the apostles, the
      martyrs and the saints.<ref target="#FN13">13</ref> And I will place him in the
      Garden [paradise]…<ref target="#FN14">14</ref>
         </quote>
         <quote>
      Swahili<lb/>
      The digger of graves will live in heaven. The one who buries
      his mother with love will live in a palace in
      paradise.<ref target="#FN15">15</ref>
         </quote>
         <quote>
            <hi rend="italic">aljamiado</hi>
            <lb/>
      [Moses asks] What will the reward be for the one who buries
      the deceased? [Allah responds] I will prepare for him a
      palace in paradise.<ref target="#FN16">16</ref>
         </quote>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P10"/>[10] The
    general pattern found in these examples is one where Moses
    inquires as to the reward for a particular behavior (in other
    cases, he asks about the punishment), and God generally
    responds with a specific compensation—sometimes in this
    world, sometimes in the hereafter, and occasionally in both.
    The questions are short, and God’s responses are
    equivalent in length, if not slightly longer. In the texts
    above, the only text that does not indicate Moses’
    question is the Swahili, which tends to have fewer questions
    from Moses and longer monologues on God’s part covering a
    wider area of issues. It appears as if Moses’ questions
    are implied in the Swahili text, and the material takes on the
    character of a summary of the conversation between God and
    Moses.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P11"/>[11] Very
    frequently in the four textual traditions under examination,
    the rewards and punishments are similar. For example, the only
    text above which does not specify paradise as part of the
    reward is the Syriac, but it does indicate “a robe of the
    light of my divinity.”<ref target="#FN17">17</ref> A typical example of where the
    four traditions do agree on rewards is when Moses wants to know
    what the one who walks with or carries the bier of the dead
    will receive. In each text, either sins or debts or both will
    be forgiven.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P12"/>[12] A
    further ritual concern has to do with prayer. Interestingly,
    the Syriac and Ge’ez texts include rewards for those who
    pray at all of the appointed times throughout the day—in
    the evening, during the night when people sleep, before dawn,
    and at the third, sixth and ninth hours. The <hi rend="italic">aljamiado</hi>
    and Swahili texts aren’t as specific, for example:</p>
         <quote>
            <hi rend="italic">aljamiado</hi>
            <lb/>
      [God asks] Moses, do you want me to hear and respond to your
      prayers? [Moses] said, Yes, Lord. [God responds] Then pray at
      night when people sleep.<ref target="#FN18">18</ref>
         </quote>
         <quote>
      Swahili<lb/>
      [God says] Make your prayers numerous at every hour.<ref target="#FN19">19</ref>
         </quote>
         <p>The <hi rend="italic">aljamiado</hi> texts indicate other times for prayer
    throughout the day, corresponding to Islamic practice, although
    they are not every three hours as found in the Syriac and
    Ge’ez texts, which reflect Christian practice.<ref target="#FN20">20</ref>
         </p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P13"/>[13]
    Concern for the ‘other’ is a key theme in all of
    these texts; whether it be parents, neighbors. widows, orphans,
    the hungry, the poor, a large part of the conversation between
    God and Moses has to do with these groups of people and their
    proper treatment. Each of the texts under study is very
    explicit, and some of them add significant detail in
    differentiating between these groups. A poor person, for
    example, might not have money, or clothing, food or shelter, or
    even friends. The Swahili text, though perhaps the least
    expansive, provides a good summary of the content found in each
    of the texts. Here God tells Moses to “respect your
    neighbor, be generous to the poor and to the orphans, and live
    in peace with all people,” indicating proper behavior,
    and then concludes with positive reinforcement, “I will
    reward you later.”<ref target="#FN21">21</ref>
         </p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P14"/>[14] The
    second category of questions reflects Moses’ desire to
    know more about the nature and origin of the Divine. For
    example, in each tradition Moses wants to be able to see God,
    very much like Exod 33:18-20, where Moses says
    “‘Show me your glory, I pray.’ And he said,
    ‘I will make all my goodness pass before you…
    But,’ he said, ‘you cannot see my face; for no one
    shall see me and live.’” In the <hi rend="italic">aljamiado</hi>
    texts, Iblis actually tempts Moses to ask this question.</p>
         <quote>
      Syriac<lb/>
      [Moses says] I beg you that I might see you with my eyes?
      [God responds] You are not able to see me, Moses. [Moses
      persists, saying] If I see you, I will tell the children of
      Israel that I have seen God, and I will speak the truth with
      them. [God commands] Arise, pray, O Moses.<ref target="#FN22">22</ref>
         </quote>
         <quote>
      Ge’ez<lb/>
      [Moses says] O Lord, can I see you with my eyes? [God
      responds] O Moses, I will let you see me so that you can
      justly say that you have seen God who is above the water.
    </quote>
         <quote>
      Moses pray and demand to see me. <ref target="#FN23">23</ref>
         </quote>
         <quote>
      Swahili<lb/>
      [Moses says] My Lord! I wish to see you! [The narrator
      explains that] Moses saw what seemed like a valley of bright
      light. He fainted again… he heard hundreds of angels
      calling him: Moses! You have sinned! The Lord cannot be seen!
      And Moses felt as if the mountains were crumbling and the
      earth was sinking away.<ref target="#FN24">24</ref>
         </quote>
         <quote>
            <hi rend="italic">aljamiado</hi>
            <lb/>
      [Moses says] Now show me yourself so that I might see you.
      [Allah responds]… O Moses, son of Imran, you have
      asked for a mighty thing… O Moses, you cannot see
      me.<ref target="#FN25">25</ref>
            <lb/>
            <lb/>
      [Moses says] O my Lord, let me see your face.… [Allah
      responds] O Moses you cannot see me. [Moses persists] My
      Lord, as I hear your word [voice?] let me see your face
      because my community doubts.<ref target="#FN26">26]</ref>
         </quote>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P15"/>[15] The
    Swahili and <hi rend="italic">aljamiado</hi> texts indicate that as a result
    of this request, the earth quakes and Moses faints for up to
    three days, at which point he is revived by God and his senses
    are restored. At the outset, God tells Moses in the Syriac, the
    Swahili and the <hi rend="italic">aljamiado</hi> texts that this request
    cannot be granted. In the Syriac text, however, God finally
    allows Moses a glimpse of heaven, and in the <hi rend="italic">aljamiado</hi>
    text, Moses faints when he sees a glimpse of God’s
    grandeur. In the Ge’ez text, Moses sees God’s
    presence but cannot perceive what is before him.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P16"/>[16]
    Following this line of questioning, Moses also asks God in each
    of the texts where God lives or where God is, and where God was
    prior to the creation of the universe. The Syriac, Ge’ez,
    and <hi rend="italic">aljamiado</hi> texts all have a similar progression of
    questions and answers: 1) Lord, are you near or far? God
    responds by saying that God is both above and below everything,
    and that God dwells in every place; 2) What is your clothing
    and your food? God responds variously; in the Syriac, for
    example, God says that the tears of sinners are food, and the
    praises of angels and the repentance of humans is clothing; 3)
    How did you exist before you created heaven and earth? God says
    that God resided with the holy throne; 4) What kind of throne
    was it? Where were you before the throne? Who was bearing the
    throne? Again, God answers these questions to various degrees
    in the dialogue texts. 5) O Lord, do you sleep? In each text we
    learn that God does not sleep, and God provides a parable to
    illustrate the point. The Swahili text is again probably the
    least expansive in this area, not asking as many questions but
    containing more of a summary of the questions asked in the
    other traditions.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P17"/>[17] The
    third category of questions is addressed by all of the
    traditions except the Ge’ez text, which does not deal
    with a final judgment or redemption. The Syriac, the Swahili
    and the <hi rend="italic">aljamiado</hi> traditions, however, connect Adam to
    both Moses and the contemporary audience being addressed. The
    Syriac text points to the redemption of Adam from Gehenna
    through Jesus Christ, and the restoration of Adam and his
    descendants to the Garden of Eden.</p>
         <quote>
      O Moses, this is the word between me and your father Adam:
      After five thousand five hundred years I will descend to
      deliver him, and will pay his debts and sins; and I shall
      receive mocking, and spitting upon my face, and they shall
      fix nails in my hands and feet, and put on my head a crown of
      thorns, and smite me with a spear, and kill me; and they
      shall bury me, and I shall rise from the grave after three
      days; and I shall ascend to heaven and take up with me Adam
      and his children, and make him inherit the kingdom of
      heaven.<ref target="#FN27">27</ref>

         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P18"/>[18] The
    <hi rend="italic">aljamiado</hi> and Swahili texts, in contrast, point to
    numerous Adams with a final human Adam who is the ancestor of
    Moses as well as all human beings. Because this human Adam
    sinned, and was expelled from the Garden, all humans must die.
    These two traditions emphasize, however, that Allah will be
    with believers who follow his will which is encompassed in the
    five pillars of Islam.</p>
         <quote>
      After that, Confessor, I created Adam, who would rule the
      jinns and make them his subjects. Listen carefully: this is
      not <hi rend="italic">your</hi> Adam who was your ancestor, it was not the
      same person. This Adam lived for a thousand and ten years,
      then I took him away and replaced him with another king of
      the jinns. Many years later I created the human Adam and his
      wife, Eve. All their descendants will die at an unknown time,
      so remember to repent your sins daily, keep the fast in
      Ramadan… <ref target="#FN28">28]</ref>
         </quote>
         <p>The <hi rend="italic">aljamiado</hi> texts provide further detail on the
    Adams that were created. In conversation with Moses, Allah
    says:</p>
         <quote>
      … I created a man whose name was Adam, and he lived
      ten thousand years; he was not one of the angels, or a human,
      or even a jinn. After that I created another Adam, and
      still later another Adam, and yet another Adam, until I
      created ten thousand Adams. Each one lived ten thousand
      years. …and then after [Iblis] disobeyed me, and
      descended to earth, I created your father Adam and he lived
      one thousand years.<ref target="#FN29">29</ref>

            <anchor corresp="P19"/>[19]
    Overall, these texts also reflect some differences, primarily
    in the area of content. The religious bent of the authors of
    the Syriac, Swahili, and <hi rend="italic">aljamiado</hi> texts becomes clear
    within just a few lines of each text with the exception of the
    Ge’ez text. Since the Ge’ez  is so close to
    the Syriac text, it is not as easy to tell that it was used in
    a Falasha community. The <hi rend="italic">aljamiado</hi> and Swahili texts
    mention Muhammed often, and Allah even commands Moses to pray
    for Muhammand and fellow Muslims. In both of these textual
    traditions, Moses becomes jealous of Muhammed, who has not even
    been born yet, and desires to know more about this man for whom
    he must pray. Moses asks Allah, “Who is Muhammed, O Lord,
    that I cannot approach you with saying a prayer for
    him?”<ref target="#FN30">30</ref> While the Islamic texts are not polemical
    against either the Jewish or Christian communities, the Syriac
    text concludes with a strong anti-Jewish polemic:</p>
         <quote>
      … I will scatter [the Jews] through creation, and take
      from them the priesthood and the kingdom and the prophecy,
      and give them to be stained black, so that they shall be as
      dogs hated of every one.<ref target="#FN31">31</ref>
         </quote>
         <p>The Ge’ez text, which is otherwise so close to the
    Syriac, but represents Ethiopian Jews, logically does not
    include the polemic.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P20"/>[20]
    Another interesting difference between the Syriac and the other
    texts in this tradition is with the nature of the prohibitions
    that Moses and God discuss. While in the Swahili and
    <hi rend="italic">aljamiado</hi> texts, God prohibits fornication, the Syriac
    text goes into some detail about male sexual activity with
    boys, beasts or other men.<ref target="#FN32">32</ref> There are explicit punishments
    indicated for the different types of sexual activity, as well
    as directions as to how one might atone for these sins. One
    wonders where the impetus arose for such an extensive
    discussion on this subject which is entirely absent from the
    other traditions.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P21"/>[21]
    Based on this preliminary discussion, it seems clear that these
    texts have a common source, although it is not clear what that
    source is. The Syriac, Ge’ez, and Swahili texts all look
    as if they relate in some way to a larger tradition, such as
    the one represented in the <hi rend="italic">aljamiado</hi> tradition. At
    this point there are three fairly extensive <hi rend="italic">aljamiado</hi>
    dialogues, and they contain almost every feature found in the
    later texts discussed here. Did the <hi rend="italic">Moriscos</hi> in Spain
    originate this Moses tradition? It does not seem likely, given
    the condition of the community in the sixteenth
    century.<ref target="#FN33">33</ref> These Spanish Muslims were a remnant of the
    former Islamic population in Spain, and they were fighting a
    loosing battle against persecution, exile or assimilation. The
    texts themselves show a people who had lost their Arabic
    language skills, but had not gained literary Spanish
    proficiency in their place. The Arabic words in the texts are
    often used improperly, or are completely misunderstood. The
    author or authors did not seem to have a grasp of either
    Spanish or Arabic grammar. Finally, among the texts dealing
    with biblical characters or themes, there are very few original
    compositions. Most of the ideas in the <hi rend="italic">aljamiado</hi> texts
    can be traced back to Medieval Islamic literature, commentary,
    or hadith material.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P22"/>[22] To
    date, I have not encountered a tradition in medieval Islamic
    texts which closely matches the material in this grouping.
    Obvious places to start would be commentators like Al-Kisai and
    Al-Tabari, but neither contains Moses material that is similar
    in form or content to these dialogues. This does not mean,
    however, that such an “ur-tradition” does not exist
    in Islamic literature. In even a cursory examination of these
    texts, it becomes clear that the concerns addressed are very
    close to those found in the Quran itself and in the hadith
    material—especially the emphasis on proper treatment of
    the poor, the hungry, orphans, widows, parents, the oppressed,
    and the dead, along with a great deal of attention on prayer,
    lending money, associating with righteous people, and sexual
    behavior. In addition, the reward/punishment schema is found
    throughout the Koran—particularly in relation to
    salvation or damnation, which are central issues in these
    texts.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P23"/>[23]
    Given the fact that “The Colloquy” is widely
    attested in Christian Arabic, one might investigate connections
    between the Arabic mss and the Islamic traditions.
    Interestingly, there are no such Muslim dialogues in
    Arabic. It is clear that the authors of the
    <hi rend="italic">aljamiado</hi> texts did not know Arabic very well, if at
    all, and that even their Spanish lacked polish. Since there are
    no other examples of this type of dialogue in Christian
    literature, and the dialogues in Jewish literature don’t
    really correspond in terms of style and content,<ref target="#FN34">34</ref> it is possible
    that these dialogues have all been influenced by some earlier,
    and fairly prominent, Islamic Moses tradition.</p>_______<lb/>

    eating. The Rabbis conclude that God does not eat. Another
    group of midrashic passages deal with whether or not God
    sleeps—very much like the passages under study
    here—and the Rabbis conclude that God does not sleep
    either. A few rabbinic passages deal with where God resides in
    heaven and provide descriptions of the throne. Exodus Rabbah
    23:13, for example, incorporates the image found in the Syriac
    text that God’s throne is borne by four angels in the
    forms of a human, an eagle, a lion, and a bull. Beyond these
    slight similarities in theme, however, there is nothing
    specific that connects these four textual traditions to Jewish
    literature of either the rabbinic or medieval period in any
    substantial way. <ref target="#FNRef34">

         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P1"/>[1] I wish
    that this grammar had been around when I was learning Syriac.
    Thackston's grammar is without doubt the best introduction to
    the Syriac language presently available, and although I have
    not been asked to write an overview of introductory Syriac
    grammars, I find that some comparison will be necessary.
    Thackston's introduction far surpasses Robinson's trusted
    grammar in several areas: better exercises, clearer
    explanations, a better glossary, a real index, and a very nice
    chrestomathy. Although Takamitsu Muraoka's recent <hi rend="italic">Classical
    Syriac: A Basic Grammar with a Chrestomathy</hi> certainly has
    some strengths in comparison with Thackston's grammar (which
    will be noted), Muraoka's presentation of the language and
    extremely limited exercises limit its practicality as a
    teaching grammar. In my opinion Muraoka's grammar might instead
    be used with students as a "light" version of a reference
    grammar, a role in which I have found it useful.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P2"/>[2]
    Thackston's grammar begins with a brief introductory chapter
    presenting phonetics, the alphabet, vocalization. Following
    this are twenty separate lessons that gradually present the
    language, each with a set of exercises, including English into
    Syriac as well as Syriac into English. Each chapter also
    includes a list of vocabulary that is geared toward enabling
    the student to read real texts from the Peshitto as soon as
    possible. Thackston's decision to focus on the Peshitto is
    based on its importance as a (perhaps the) foundational text of
    Syriac culture, the Biblical text's familiarity to the likely
    student, and the fact that its language and vocabulary had a
    considerable influence on later Syriac style.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P3"/>[3] In order
    to use real examples from the Peshitto almost from the
    beginning, Thackston must present at least some aspects of the
    verb earlier than is done in Robinson's grammar, for instance.
    Rather than postponing all verb forms until the second half of
    the grammar as Robinson does, Thackston presents the perfect
    form of the verb in the second lesson. This organization has
    several benefits: it not only allows the student to read more
    interesting sentences from a real text, but more importantly
    perhaps, it also enables the student to begin learning verbs,
    along with other parts of speech, right from the beginning. The
    full conjugation of the verb, however, is postponed until the
    second half, enabling the student to gain some footing in the
    language before tackling the numerous verbal forms.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P4"/>[4]
    Throughout the grammar, forms and exercises are given in the
    Estrangelo script, which is also an improvement over Robinson
    (who uses Serto), since most textual editions tend to be
    printed using this script (although one wishes the publisher
    had found a better font!). The chrestomathy, however, while
    favoring Estrangelo, includes texts in all three scripts on a
    variety of topics and at different levels of difficulty.
    Unfortunately, all of these texts are unvocalized, and it would
    be helpful to have a couple of texts where the two different
    systems of vocalization are used, so that the student may begin
    learn these as well (especially the East Syriac system).
    Furthermore, it would be nice to have the sort of helpful
    grammatical and vocabulary notes that Muraoka provides for his
    chrestomathy, although I suppose that one has no right to
    expect this (and in this regard, I find Muraoka's chrestomathy
    superior).</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P5"/>[5] The
    grammar's greatest strength in my opinion is the way that
    Thackston handles the issue of vocalization. In presenting the
    language, Thackston gives all words and forms in both
    unvocalized Syriac and a vocalized transcription, in the
    glossary as well as in the grammar. The unvocalized Syriac
    prepares the student from the beginning for eventually reading
    texts without vowels, while at the same time encouraging them
    to learn the vocalizations, which they become able to associate
    with the unvocalized forms. A real weakness of Thackston's
    grammar in this regard is the collection of verbal paradigms at
    the end of lessons. In this he departs from the pattern of the
    lessons and gives the verbal forms only in Roman transcription.
    While this is certainly helpful for seeing the vocalization of
    the verb forms clearly, it is not so useful for reading the
    unvocalized forms of the chrestomathy. Here Thackston should
    have continued his pattern of providing the Syriac script and a
    transliteration, as Muraoka has done in his more useful
    paradigms.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P6"/>[6] Also, in
    contrast to Muraoka, Thackston does not mark the pronunciation
    of the Beghadhkephat letters, either in the Syriac or the
    transcription, and this might be helpful for the beginning
    student. Thackston also provides a brief, very basic
    bibliography after these paradigms which, while sufficient,
    cannot compare to the outstanding bibliography (prepared by
    Sebastian Brock) in Muraoka's grammar.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P7"/>[7]
    Thackston's grammar is designed to be user-friendly for the
    student who does not know a Semitic language, and I think that
    it succeeds in this. It is a rather condensed presentation of
    Syriac grammar, although in comparison with Robinson, it is
    effusive. Perhaps it would be a bit much for a novice to
    Semitic languages to teach him or herself, but with the help of
    a teacher, the pace is about right. If its discussions of
    certain topics may seem a bit terse for some experts, I think
    that we would do well to remember that this is a teaching
    grammar, whose purpose is (and should be) to get the student
    into the chrestomathy (and other real texts) as soon as
    possible, where the finer points of Syriac and Semitic grammar
    can be learned. I have used this grammar to teach a student
    Syriac, and it worked very well (although the student had
    previously studied a year of Hebrew).</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P8"/>[8] One
    final weakness, and this is considerable in my mind, is the
    lack of an English-Syriac glossary. Since the grammar assigns
    English into Syriac exercises for the first fifteen of the
    twenty chapters, it seems only fair (and extremely useful) to
    provide such a tool. In this regard (and perhaps this one
    alone), the nod still goes to Robinson.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P9"/>[9] On the
    whole, this is the best teaching grammar for Syriac that is
    presently available, and in spite of a few weaknesses, it is
    far superior to its nearest competitor, which in my opinion
    remains Robinson's venerable (and out of print) grammar.</p>

         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P1"/>[1]
    Dionysius bar Salibi, one of the central figures in the Syriac
    cultural and literary “Renaissance” of the twelfth
    and thirteenth centuries, has received much attention from
    Syriac scholars as well as from Syrian-Orthodox Christians who
    kept his name and legacy alive up to the present day. Many of
    Dionysius’ writings, however, are so vast and their
    transmission so complex that they have defied scholarly
    attempts to produce critical editions and studies.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P2"/>[2]
    Dionysius’ biblical commentaries pose their specific
    problems. For several biblical books two or three different
    commentaries exist, while the underlying biblical texts have
    been identified as either Peshitta or Septuagint (or
    Syro-Hexapla). In the absence of scholars willing to devote
    their whole lifetime to studying and publishing the entire
    corpus of Dionysius’ commentaries, numerous limited
    studies of individual commentaries, or parts thereof, were
    undertaken throughout the twentieth century – mainly in
    academic theses and dissertations (which often remained
    unpublished) – thereby causing a fragmentation of the
    field. As for the textual tradition, a great number of
    manuscripts have been located and identified, through the
    efforts of Arthur Vööbus and, more recently, Gabriel
    Rabo. Unfortunately, many of the Middle Eastern manuscripts are
    not easily accessible or are available in the West only in
    unsatisfactory microfilm copies.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P3"/>[3] At first
    sight, Stephen Ryan’s monograph, devoted to the
    interpretation of only ten psalms (Pss. 73-82), seems to add
    just one more publication to the fragmented field of the study
    of Dionysius’ biblical interpretation. This first
    impression, however, proves to be wrong. This study has much
    more to offer! Due to its broad and comprehensive approach, its
    thoroughness, and its rigid methodology, we are in fact dealing
    with an exemplary piece of work, which sets new standards for
    future research on Dionysius.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P4"/>[4] The two
    introductory chapters (“The Life and Work of Dionysius
    Bar Salibi” and “Previous Studies on the Biblical
    Commentaries”) provide an excellent survey of existing
    scholarship, commenting on an impressive number of studies,
    many of which – as mentioned above – did not lead
    to official publications. Chapter Three addresses the
    distinction between “factual” and
    “spiritual” interpretation, terms that are often
    used to characterize the double or multiple commentaries that
    exist for each biblical book. While Dionysius himself uses the
    terms <hi rend="italic">su<hi rend="sup">c</hi>ronoyo</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ru<hi rend="u">h</hi>onoyo</hi>, the distinction is not always very rigid
    and commentaries are regularly described – by him or by
    later scribes – as “factual and spiritual”
    (at the same time) or “mixed” (<hi rend="italic">mfattko</hi>).
    While for some biblical books the factual commentary is longer
    than the spiritual one, for other books it is the non-factual
    commentary (i.e., “spiritual”, “mixed”,
    or “factual and spiritual”) that is longer. This
    raises the question of the interrelationship and the hierarchy
    between the two types. Ryan argues that the original layout of
    Dionysius’ commentaries was in synoptic columns, a layout
    preserved in two early manuscripts (Z = Mardin Orthodox 67,
    between the 12th and the 14th centuries, and R = Mardin
    Orthodox 66, probably 1189 AD). Parallels for this bipartite,
    or tripartite, layout may be found in Michael the Great’s
    Chronicle, in which the materials are organized in three
    columns, devoted, respectively, to ecclesiastical history,
    civil history, and mixed materials – see particularly
    Dorothea Weltecke, “Originality and Function of Formal
    Structures in the Chronicle of Michael the Great”,
    <ref target="../Vol3No2/">
               <hi rend="italic">Hugoye</hi> 3/2</ref> (July 2000), and
    Ead., <hi rend="italic">Die «Beschreibung der Zeiten» von Mor
    Michael dem Grossen (1126-1199)</hi> (CSCO 594 / Subs. 110;
    Louvain, 2003), 163-178. Just as the ecclesiastical history in
    the case of Michael, Dionysius’ spiritual commentary,
    deemed of greater importance, was originally placed in the
    “superior”, i.e., right hand column.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P5"/>[5] Basing
    themselves on, and partly misled by, some of Dionysius’
    own comments, previous scholars often assumed that the factual
    commentaries were based mainly on the Peshitta, while the
    spiritual commentaries had the Septuagint, or the Syro-Hexapla,
    as their basis. Ryan shows this assumption to be wrong. The
    high concentration of Syro-Hexapla quotations in the mixed
    commentary of Pss. 1-26 is due entirely to the fact that this
    section, as indicated by Dionysius himself, was copied from the
    Psalm Commentary of Andrew of Jerusalem, supposedly of Greek
    origin. In other parts of his work, in both the factual and
    non-factual commentaries, Dionysius used the Peshitta
    primarily. The limited number of quotations close to the Greek
    (and often explicitly referred to as “Greek” or
    “Seventy”) must have been part of Dionysius’
    borrowings from Greek sources. Most of them are unrelated to
    the Syro-Hexapla.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P6"/>[6] This
    brings us to the question of Dionysius’ sources, which is
    discussed in Chapter Four. Dionysius himself explicitly
    mentions “the work of Andrew, the priest of
    Jerusalem”, which he used in his mixed commentary of Pss.
    1-26, and “Athanasius and Daniel and Zur<hi rend="sup">c</hi>o the
    Nisibene”, authors used from Ps. 27 onwards. While a
    detailed analysis of all the data on Andrew and
    Zur<hi rend="sup">c</hi>o does not lead to an identification of these
    authors, we are on firmer grounds with Athanasius (of
    Alexandria) and Daniel (of <hi rend="u">S</hi>ala<hi rend="u">h</hi>). Ryan argues that the
    long Syriac form of Athanasius’ Commentary on the Psalms
    was known to Dionysius, while contacts with the short version
    may also be detected (both versions were published by R.W.
    Thomson, in CSCO 386-387 / Syr. 167-168, 1977). As for Daniel
    of <hi rend="u">S</hi>ala<hi rend="u">h</hi>,
    Dionysius’ commentary shows correspondences with the
    longer version of Daniel’s commentary (in the process of
    publication by David Taylor) as well as with an abbreviated
    edition of this work, often attributed to Daniel “of
    Tella”, and possibly posterior to Dionysius. In addition
    to Moshe bar Kifo, whose “Introduction to the
    Psalms” Dionysius himself may have incorporated into his
    own work, one other important source for Dionysius’
    factual commentary – not acknowledged by him! – can
    be identified, namely the ninth-century East Syrian commentator
    Isho<hi rend="sup">c</hi>dad of Merv (published by C. Van den Eynde in
    CSCO 433-434 / Syr. 185-186, 1981). Dionysius’ dependence
    on Isho<hi rend="sup">c</hi>dad had been established as early as 1902 by
    G. Diettrich (<hi rend="italic">Išô<hi rend="sup">c</hi>dâdh’s
    Stellung in der Auslegungsgeschichte des Alten Testaments</hi>)
    and is now further substantiated by Ryan.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P7"/>[7] Chapter
    Five deals with the manuscript tradition. Nine manuscripts
    – five preserved in Western collections and four in the
    Middle East – were used for the edition. Nine more
    manuscripts, mostly of a recent date, were discarded or could
    not be accessed. As appears from the stemma, three Mardin
    manuscripts (all three from Deir ez Za<hi rend="sup">c</hi>faran) emerge
    as the primary witnesses: mss. Z and R (mentioned above) as
    well as ms. A (Mardin Orthodox 69); R and A go back to the same
    (lost) <hi rend="italic">Vorlage</hi> (Y). The three manuscripts all seem to
    belong to the 12th-14th centuries. Ryan explains in great
    detail his editorial method, which aims at establishing an
    eclectic text, choosing “the best text for each reading,
    assigning the other readings to the apparatus” (p. 107).
    In this process, ms. P (= Paris, <hi rend="italic">Bibliothèque
    Nationale</hi>, Syr. 66, AD 1354 – an indirect descendant
    of R) serves as “a reference text”. The reason for
    not working from a clear base manuscript (in which only the
    obvious errors and omissions would have to be corrected) is
    that ms. Z, the obvious candidate, was available only in a
    defective microfilm (preserved in the Vööbus
    Collection at the Institute for Syriac Manuscript Studies,
    Lutheran School of Theology, Chicago).</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P8"/>[8] Chapter
    Six is the most substantial part of the book, offering the
    critical edition, and translation of Pss. 73-82. The factual
    commentary is presented first (p. 110-143), followed by the
    mixed commentary (p. 144-211). The latter normally is longer
    than the former, while within the mixed commentary of Ps. 74
    two successive explanations are presented. Parallels to the
    long and short versions of Athanasius, to Daniel of
    <hi rend="u">S</hi>ala<hi rend="u">h</hi>, and to
    Isho<hi rend="sup">c</hi>dad of Merv are indicated in the translation,
    while footnotes provide textual comments as well as further
    references to authors such as Evagrius Ponticus, Severus of
    Antioch, and Hippolytus of Rome. The juxtaposition of the two
    commentaries for each psalm clearly illustrates
    Dionysius’ different approaches in each of them. At the
    same time, we see Dionysius at work, incorporating earlier
    tradition and building upon it, in order to create his own
    synthesis. Apparently in an attempt to compensate for the
    analytical and dissecting approach of most of the book, in a
    brief concluding chapter (p. 212-223) Ryan sketches the broader
    contours of Dionysius’ Psalm exegesis, putting him in
    conversation with major interpreters of the Christian (Western)
    and Jewish tradition.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P9"/>[9]
    Returning for a moment to the text edition, we should point out
    that the choice for Psalms 73-82 was dictated by the existence
    of an unpublished Ph.D. dissertation by Marjorie Helen Simpkin,
    submitted at the University of Melbourne in 1974 and consulted
    by Ryan. It is to be hoped, of course, that such a major work
    as Dionysius bar Salibi’s Psalm Commentary, will soon be
    available in full, and not just in bits and pieces, in
    different states of accessibility. From this perspective, it is
    to be regretted that the present edition could not be based on
    the best manuscripts, thus inaugurating a homogeneous edition
    of the whole work. Isn’t it sad that Western scholars
    have to turn to poor and deteriorating microfilms, made several
    decades ago, rather than being able to consult the manuscripts
    themselves?</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P10"/>[10]
    These remarks by no means detract from the very fine quality of
    Ryan’s edition and annotated translation. A very few
    minor suggestions are offered here.</p>
         <list type="unordered">
            <item>P. 40 (in the quotation from Dionysius’
      introduction to the factual commentary on the Psalms): the
      translation “occasions” for
      <hi rend="italic">
                  <hi rend="sup">c</hi>elloto</hi> (“their factual sense and
      their occasions”, i.e., of the psalms) conceals the
      fact that we are dealing with a technical term, reflecting
      the Greek <hi rend="italic">hypothesis</hi>. Perhaps “themes” or
      “subjects” would be a better translation.</item>
            <item>The translation of <hi rend="italic">metyad<hi rend="sup">c</hi>ono</hi> is
      problematic throughout the volume. The following translations
      are presented: p. 28, first paragraph: “mystical”
      (commentary); p. 144, line 7: “spiritual”
      (Israel); p. 158, line 7: “metaphorical”
      (“metaphorical darkness or iniquity of
      idolatry”); p. 170, line 4: “mystical”
      (Israel); p. 172, line 6: “suprasensual”
      (beings); p. 190, line 7: “mystical”
      (nourishment) [<hi rend="italic">tursoyo metyad<hi rend="sup">c</hi>ono</hi> is
      explained a bit further: “angels are not fed or
      purified or illuminated by anything else other than knowledge
      and revelations and the observance of the divine will”,
      which indicates that an intellectual process is involved]; p.
      198, line 4: “mystical” (peoples). In all these
      instances a translation would be required that does justice
      to the basic meaning of “understanding” (even if
      different levels of understanding are involved).
      “Intellectual” would have been an acceptable
      translation in most, if not all, of the above passages.</item>
            <item>P. 122: the Greek and Hebrew quotations of Ps. 76:10 [LXX
      75:11] would deserve some explanation. While for the Greek
      quotation Dionysius may have been inspired by
      Isho<hi rend="sup">c</hi>dad, he did not take over
      Isho<hi rend="sup">c</hi>dad’s actual reading (which agrees with
      the Syro-Hexapla). Dionysius’ rendering of the Greek
      <hi rend="italic">heortasei</hi> as <hi rend="italic">te<hi rend="sup">c</hi>bed <hi rend="sup">c</hi>ido</hi>
      “it shall make a feast” (vs.
      <hi rend="italic">n<hi rend="sup">c</hi>ad<hi rend="sup">c</hi>ed</hi> in Syro-Hexapla and
      Isho<hi rend="sup">c</hi>dad) may reflect a non-Syro-Hexaplaric or
      pre-Syro-Hexaplaric reading in one of Dionysius’
      sources.</item>
            <item>P. 174, line 10: if <hi rend="italic">man</hi> is taken not as the
      interrogative pronoun, but as representing Greek <hi rend="italic">men</hi>,
      there is no reason to regard the text as corrupt: “And
      there is no consoler, i.e., as for consolation, I did not
      find one in this world.” (Athanasius’ text,
      quoted on p. 175, note, seems to confirm this, as it has the
      opposition <hi rend="italic">man</hi> – <hi rend="italic">dên</hi>)</item>
            <item>P. 208, line 6: wouldn’t the addition of <hi rend="italic">men</hi>
      be required after <hi rend="italic">da-glizin</hi> “deprived of the
      true Father”?</item>
         </list>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P11"/>[11] In
    conclusion, Stephen Ryan is to be congratulated with the
    publication of this well-written, carefully presented, and
    almost impeccably printed monograph on a significant work by a
    major Syrian-Orthodox author. He has critically surveyed the
    whole field of research on Dionysius and laid the groundwork
    for important future contributions, by himself as well as by
    others.</p>

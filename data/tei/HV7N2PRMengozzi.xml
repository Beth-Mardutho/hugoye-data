         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P1"/>[1] Angelo
    Guido Calonghi was an esteemed psycho-therapist in Turin, who
    cultivated, besides his profession, a learned and passionate
    interest for Eastern Christianity. He travelled in the Middle
    East and collected much information and bibliographic material
    on the subject. This book is the product of his collaboration
    with the Assumptionist Father Xavier Jacob, who lived in Turkey
    for many years. Unfortunately, it is not specified which parts
    of the text are the work of one or the other author.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P2"/>[2] In the
    preface, the authors state that they intend to provide their
    readers with a quantitative—i.e.,
    demographic—rather than qualitative presentation of the
    Christian communities in the Middle East. This purpose is
    achieved only in the central part of the volume, which does
    indeed represent an outstanding contribution to our factual
    knowledge of Eastern-Christian history.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P3"/>[3] The
    first part (19-126) provides a historical overview of the
    Christian presence in the East as mentioned in the title and
    subtitle of the book. It is mainly based on secondary
    literature from the Fifties and Sixties of the 20th century.
    The bibliography is incomplete: among the French works alone,
    it does not include, e.g., J. M. Fiey, <hi rend="italic">Assyrie
    Chrétienne</hi>, Beyrouth 1965, R. Khawam, <hi rend="italic">L'univers
    culturel des chrétiens d'Orient</hi>, Paris 1987, B.
    Landron, <hi rend="italic">Chrétiens et musulmans en Irak.</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">Attitudes nestoriennes vis-à-vis de l'Islam</hi>,
    Paris 1994, J. M. Billioud, <hi rend="italic">Histoire des chrétiens
    d'Orient</hi>, Paris 1995, or R. Le Coz, <hi rend="italic">Église
    d’Orient. Chrétiens d'Irak, d'Iran et de
    Turquie</hi>, Paris 1995. An up-dated and richer bibliography
    is badly needed on specific topics, such as, e.g., the
    beginning of the Chaldean movement (121, carefully studied by
    the late Father Joseph Habbi in “Signification de l'union
    chaldéenne de Mar Sulaqa avec Rome en 1553”,
    <hi rend="italic">L'Orient Syrien</hi> 11 (1966) 99-132 and 199-230) or the
    Protestant missions in the Middle East (123-24; see, e.g., J.
    F. Coakley, <hi rend="italic">The Church of the East and the Church of
    England</hi>, Oxford 1992, and H.L. Murre-van den Berg,
    <hi rend="italic">From a Spoken to a Written Language</hi>, Leiden 1999).</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P4"/>[4] The
    survey on Eastern Christianity (chapter 1-4) is inserted in the
    broader framework of European history and shows traces of a
    theological approach. Taking a quite original point of view, at
    risk of falling into a vicious circle, the authors maintain
    that the cultural differences which conditioned the emergence
    of the various Eastern Churches first developed as differences
    in the liturgy. The theological interests (and sympathies) of
    the authors lead them to address complicated issues such as the
    doctrinal and moral features which favoured the spread of
    Christianity in the first centuries (23-24, 29) or, later on,
    the conversion of many Eastern Christians to Islam (83-83, 93
    and 111). The relative mildness of Ottoman policy towards the
    Christians is interpreted as influenced by Sufi mysticism
    rather than Sunni jurisprudence (115).</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P5"/>[5] The
    authors are aware of the problem of self-denomination vs.
    polemic and heresiologic terminology (69). Nevertheless, they
    resort to terms such as ‘Jacobites’ and
    ‘Nestorians’ throughout the book. Despite the
    important distinctions introduced in a correct approach to this
    matter (e.g., S. Brock, "The ‘Nestorian’ Church: A
    Lamentable Misnomer," <hi rend="italic">Bulletin of the John Rylands Library
    of Manchester</hi> 78 (1996) 23-36, not mentioned by the
    authors), Nestorianism is said to have become nothing but the
    ‘official doctrine’ of the Persian Church (45).</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P6"/>[6] The
    fourth chapter is dedicated to the relationship between
    Christianity and the Turks and is followed by two appendices:
    on demographic data in the reign of Suleiman the Magnificent
    (1520-1535) and on the Jewish communities in the East from
    Biblical times to the 19th century (130-139). The demographic
    appendix reproduces the study published by Ö. L. Barkan,
    ‘Essai sur les données statistiques des registres
    de recensements dans l'Empir Ottoman aux XVe et XVIe
    siècle’, <hi rend="italic">Journal of the Economic and Social
    History of the Orient</hi> 1 (1958) 9-36, with critical
    comments by our authors.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P7"/>[7] The
    fifth chapter is entitled ‘Christians in the Ottoman
    Empire of Asia’. After a survey on the concept and
    history of the census as a major institution in modern states
    (140-145), two bibliographic sources on Ottoman censuses in the
    19th century are presented: V. Cuinet, <hi rend="italic">La Turquie d'Asie,
    Géographie Administrative</hi>, 4 vols., Paris 1891-1897
    and K. H. Karpat, <hi rend="italic">Ottoman Population 1830-1914. Demographic
    and Social Characteristics</hi>, Madison, The University of
    Wisconsin Press 1985. Cuinet integrated the results of Ottoman
    censuses with data provided by local informants, oral tradition
    and historical notices occasionally given by travellers or in
    administrative reports (150-151). Karpat's work concentrates on
    the data that Turkish functionaries collected in the censuses
    of 1881/82-1893 and 1905-1906, in the context of various
    attempts to reform Ottoman bureaucracy and the levy system
    (146-150).</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P8"/>[8] Central
    to the 5th chapter (153-348) are Cuinet's and Karpat's figures
    for each of the 25 provinces (<hi rend="italic">vilâyet</hi> or
    <hi rend="italic">mutasarriflık</hi>) which formed the Ottoman Empire
    during the last decade of the 19th and the first decade of the
    20th centuries. Each province is presented as follows: 1) a map
    derived from Cuinet's cartography (names of places are
    sometimes reproduced in small characters that make them almost
    unreadable); 2) a table giving the administrative districts of
    the province (<hi rend="italic">sancàk</hi>s and <hi rend="italic">kazā</hi>s);
    3) a historical sketch of the province and the districts with
    particular reference to the arrival of Christianity, the first
    Muslim invasions, the Ottoman conquest, and, when available,
    details on the contemporary situation of the Christians; 4)
    tables which report the demographic data of the province in
    general and of each district.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P9"/>[9] The
    historical notices and the demographic tables are extremely
    useful. In a couple of paragraphs, the reader gains an insight
    into the history of each district. Unfortunately, no
    bibliography is given in these sections. Information on the
    contemporary situation was possibly provided by local
    informants, especially Western missionaries (see the long list
    of prelates, monks and nuns acknowledged in the preface,
    14-15). The demographic tables give the absolute and relative
    figures of Muslims, Jews, Christians (total number and number
    for each denomination, Eastern and Western) and other religious
    and/or national minorities (e.g., Yezidis, Tziganes,
    Bulgarians, other foreigners), who were present in a given
    province or district when the censuses were made. Data of the
    two sources are then compared and critically discussed.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P10"/>[10] In
    the appendix to the fifth chapter (349-366), fifteen tables
    summarize the numerical consistence of the various religious
    communities (Muslim, non Catholic Christian, Catholic, Jewish,
    Armenian Orthodox, Greek Orthodox, Melkite Orthodox,
    East-Syrian—‘Nestorian’, Protestant, Syrian
    Orthodox, Armenian Catholic, Chaldean, Maronite, Melkite
    Catholic, Syrian Catholic) in the 25 provinces.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P11"/>[11] The
    sixth chapter (367-390) presents the Christian presence in the
    Middle East as reflected by the 20th-century censuses. The main
    sources are the <hi rend="italic">Annuaire Démographique</hi>,
    published by the United Nations (the issues considered go from
    1956 to 1993) and the <hi rend="italic">Census of Populations</hi> published
    by the Ankara Institute of Statistics. Nine tables provide the
    figures of the religious composition of the population
    (Muslims, Christians, Jews, other religions) in various years
    in Aden, Bahrain, United Arab Emirates, Iraq, Israel, Jordan,
    Kuwait, Palestine (Gaza), and Turkey. A historical sketch for
    each state and a brief discussion accompany the demographic
    tables. An appendix (391-404) outlines the evolution of the
    Christian presence in Turkey from the Ottoman to the Republican
    periods. The authors attempt then to explain the dramatic
    decrease in the number of Christians, mentioning factors such
    as the discriminatory policy of the Turkish government in
    fiscal matters and in the educational system. Both Muslim and
    non Muslim Turkish people emigrated to Europe and Israel, but
    Muslim emigration turned out to be an economically motivated
    choice limited to certain periods, while for Jews and
    Christians there has been a continuous flow of emigration.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P12"/>[12] The
    seventh chapter (405-433) presents the Catholic minority in the
    Middle East as recorded in the <hi rend="italic">Annuaire Pontifical,</hi>
    now published by the Vatican Central Office of Statistics, and
    in the <hi rend="italic">World Population Prospects. The 1992 Revision</hi>,
    published by the United Nations, New York 1993. For each
    country, a table gives the numbers of Catholics and of new
    baptisms in various years, from 1950 to 1995, specifying the
    figures per diocese and rite.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P13"/>[13] The
    eighth chapter (434-485) sums up and continues the historical
    outline of the first four chapters. The authors address two
    main questions. Firstly, they search the past of the Eastern
    Christian communities for the reasons of their demographic
    collapse. Secondly, they ask whether, despite the fall in
    demographic figures, the Eastern Christians still have a future
    in their lands of origin or whether they are condemned to
    disappear. The past of the Middle East is scanned once again in
    a rather schematic way: Constantine and the Christian Empire of
    the Middle East, the Empire of the Arabs and the difficult
    condition of the Christians as ‘discriminated
    protégées’, the egalitarian reforms
    introduced in the Ottoman Empire and the ‘psychological
    wall’ that nevertheless divided the religious minorities
    from the Muslim majority, the complicated relationships with
    the Western powers, the advent of colonialism and the emergence
    of Eastern nationalisms. A survey then describes the present
    condition of the Christian minorities in the various countries
    of the Middle East. The section which concludes the chapter is
    a sociological essay on its own, dealing with the subtle
    problems of the psychological attitudes, the sociological
    status and dynamicity of the Christian minorities as well as
    with their possible future in the era of
    ‘globalization’ and ‘new economy’.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P14"/>[14]
    Notwithstanding the title, the volume does not give a
    satisfactory general presentation of the history of Eastern
    Christianity. The authors' use of the demographic data to
    depict a broader historical picture often fails to apply a
    rigorous method. Here and there, the editorial work appears to
    have been performed hurriedly: e.g., in the table of contents
    (5-10) all the sections of the last two chapters are registered
    as being on p. 404, the two last lines of p. 484 are repeated
    at the top of the following, not all the publications quoted in
    the notes are reported in the general bibliography, etc. As a
    demographic study, however, this book is an essential tool for
    students of the minorities in the Middle East, Eastern
    Christianity, and history of missions. The demographic data and
    statistics are arranged in clear tables and diagrams. The
    sources and their limitations are always carefully presented
    and discussed.</p>

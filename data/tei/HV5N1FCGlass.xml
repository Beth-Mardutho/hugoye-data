            <anchor xml:id="P1"/>[1] Many
    thanks to all who have already offered papers for this
    Symposium, or expressed an interest in it. The final deadline
    for abstracts of papers is 15 December 2001. New offers of
    papers are still very welcome until that date. Those who have
    submitted abstracts will be notified concerning their
    participation after 15 February 2002.</p>
         <p rend="n">

    Symposium forms part of the First World Congress of Middle

    than 30 minutes by direct train from Frankfurt Airport. (And it
    is on the Rhine.)</p>

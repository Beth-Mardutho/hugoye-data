         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P1"/>[1] Many
    thanks to all who have already offered papers for this
    Symposium, or expressed an interest in it. The final deadline
    for abstracts of papers is 15 December 2001. New offers of
    papers are still very welcome until that date. Those who have
    submitted abstracts will be notified concerning their
    participation after 15 February 2002.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P2"/>[2] The
    Symposium forms part of the First World Congress of Middle
    Eastern Studies (WoCMES). Participants must register for the
    Congress: registration forms can be found on the website at
    http://www.wocmes.de ; alternatively they may be<lb/>
    requested from the Secretariat at wocmes@geo.uni-mainz.de</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P3"/>[3] More
    details of arrangements for travel, accommodation, conference
    fees and the overall programme of the Congress are to be found
    on the website. Mainz is a highly accessible venue, being less
    than 30 minutes by direct train from Frankfurt Airport. (And it
    is on the Rhine.)</p>

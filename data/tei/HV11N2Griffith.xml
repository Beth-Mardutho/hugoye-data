            <p>St. John of Damascus (c. 675 — c.
    749) was a contemporary of the Umayyad caliphs (661-750). The
    twin social processes comprising the
    ‘Arabicization’ and the concomitant
    ‘Islamicization’ of the public domain of the
    caliphate at the turn of the eighth century set the stage for
    the first Christian responses to the social and religious
    challenges of Islam. St. John of Damascus and his
    Arabic-speaking heirs were the spokesmen who upheld the
    ‘Melkite’ tradition and provided the basic
    principles for the self-definition of ‘Melkite’
    Orthodoxy in the world of Islam. The interests of the emerging
    community of ‘Melkite’ Orthodox Christians in the
    Umayyad era in Syria/Palestine furnish the most immediate frame
    of reference for appreciating the significance of the works of
    St. John of Damascus.</p>

         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P1"/>[1] The
    lifetime of St. John of Damascus (c. 675 — c. 749)
    coincided almost exactly with the length of years during which
    the Umayyad line of caliphs ruled in the world of Islam
    (661-750).<ref target="#FN1">1</ref> They had established their capital from the
    beginning of their dynasty in John’s native city of
    Damascus, thereby moving the center of Islamic government away
    from Medina in Arabia, Islam’s birthplace, across the
    former <hi rend="italic">limes arabicus</hi> of the Roman Empire, into the
    cosmopolitan world of Rome’s former provinces of Syria
    and Palestine, where Greek and Syriac-speaking Christians far
    outnumbered the Arabic-speaking Muslims. In this milieu, as a
    recent study describes its own purview of the geopolitical
    situation in Umayyad times,</p>
         <quote>
      Syria-Palestine is seen first... as a land in which a
      combination of a well established Aramaean, Hellenistic,
      Byzantine, Christian legacy interacted with the new Arab
      Islamic rule and cultural values. Secondly, it is viewed as
      an important province in an emerging Arab Islamic empire of
      which it became the political centre.<ref target="#FN2">2</ref>
         </quote>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P2"/>[2] It was
    during the Umayyad period, and particularly during the reigns
    of the caliph ‛Abd al-Malik (685-705) and his sons and
    successors that the twin social processes of Arabicization and
    Islamicization began in earnest in the territories of the
    Levant which the Muslim Arabs had conquered and occupied in the
    generation prior to John’s birth.<ref target="#FN3">3</ref> These were also the
    territories of the Roman Empire’s three ecclesiastical
    patriarchates, Alexandria, Antioch and Jerusalem. The Umayyads
    mounted a concerted campaign to claim the occupied territories
    for Islam, and it was during their reign, in the years around
    the turn of the eighth century, when “Syria underwent a
    reorientation by 180 degrees in strategic and geopolitical
    terms,”<ref target="#FN4">4</ref> that the local Christian communities themselves
    first registered their awareness that the invading and
    occupying Arabs had established a new religious hegemony in the
    land.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P3"/>[3] The
    construction of the Dome of the Rock on the Temple Mount in
    Jerusalem in the days of the caliph ʿAbd
    al-Malik,<ref target="#FN5">5</ref> and the building of the Great Umayyad Mosque of
    Damascus on the ruins of the church of St. John the Baptist in
    the time of the caliph al-Walīd (705-715)<ref target="#FN6">6</ref> were undertakings
    which monumentally testified to the on-going campaign of the
    Umayyad government to co-opt the public space in
    Syria/Palestine for Islam. Numerous other enterprises of a
    humbler sort undertaken at the same time, such as the minting
    of a distinctive Islamic coinage,<ref target="#FN7">7</ref> mandating the use of Arabic
    instead of Greek in the maintenance of the public
    records,<ref target="#FN8">8</ref> and even the design of road signs positively
    served the same purpose.<ref target="#FN9">9</ref> Negatively, the concomitant Umayyad
    campaign to remove the public display of the ensigns and
    emblems of an earlier Christian hegemony, such as the hitherto
    ubiquitous sign of the cross and the open exhibition of
    Christian icons, also helped to change the public appearance of
    the cityscape of Jerusalem and Damascus alike, to name only the
    most prominent urban localities of Syria/Palestine.<ref target="#FN10">10</ref> As a
    recent historian of the Umayyad era points out, the period of
    the combined reigns of the caliphs ‘Abd al-Malik and his
    son al-Walīd “was in some ways the high point of
    Umayyad power, witnessing significant territorial advances...
    and the emergence of a more marked Arabic and Islamic character
    in the state’s public face.”<ref target="#FN11">11</ref>
         </p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P4"/>[4] The twin
    social processes comprising the ‘Arabicization’ and
    the concomitant ‘Islamicization’ of the public
    domain of the caliphate at the turn of the eighth century set
    the stage for the first Christian responses to the social and
    religious challenges of Islam. The earliest ones included
    polemical attacks, such as the one contained in the <hi rend="italic">De
    Haeresibus</hi> section of St. John of Damascus’
    <hi rend="italic">Pēgē Gnoseos</hi>, written in Greek,<ref target="#FN12">12</ref> as
    well as a number of apocalyptic texts written in Syriac, such
    as the <hi rend="italic">Apocalypse of Pseudo-Methodius</hi>,<ref target="#FN13">13</ref> and apologetic
    texts such as the <hi rend="italic">Dialogue of a Monk of Bêt
    <hi rend="u">H</hi>ālê</hi> with a Muslim
    Notable, written in Syriac.<ref target="#FN14">14</ref> As the eighth century stretched
    into the early years of the ninth century, the Christian
    communities in the world of Islam, and especially those who
    would soon be called ‘Melkites’ in Syria/Palestine,
    whose ecclesiastical center for all practical purposes was the
    see of Jerusalem with her attendant monastic communities in
    Judea and the Sinai, adopted Arabic not only as their public
    language in the caliphate but as an ecclesiastical language as
    well, and their writers were the first among the subject
    Christians to address issues of public religious behavior in
    the Islamic realm and to make claims for a public presence of
    Arabophone Christians in the ‘World of Islam’
    (<hi rend="italic">dār al-islām</hi>).<ref target="#FN15">15</ref>
         </p>
         <head xml:id="HV11N2Griffith3">II</head>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P5"/>[5] For a
    century and more in the Roman Empire, from the time of the
    emperor Justinian I (527-565) and the council of Constantinople
    II (553) until the council of Constantinople III (681) in the
    time of the emperor Constantine IV (668-685), Christians in the
    east were embroiled in the church-dividing struggles
    precipitated by the Christological controversies which followed
    upon the decisions of the councils of Ephesus (431) and
    Chalcedon (451) in the fifth century. The theological and
    confessional struggles were exacerbated and complicated by the
    multiplicity of languages and cultures into which the seminal
    texts and doctrinal formulae of the several interested parties,
    in the several different geographical areas, were translated
    from their originally Greek sources.<ref target="#FN16">16</ref>
         </p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P6"/>[6] In the
    case of Syria/Palestine, where the so-called
    ‘dyophysite’ or Chalcedonian orthodoxy came to hold
    sway from the later fifth century onward,<ref target="#FN17">17</ref> and where Greek
    was the dominant ecclesiastical language in the numerous
    international monastic communities,<ref target="#FN18">18</ref> the Aramaic dialect of the
    local churches was Christian Palestinian Aramaic.<ref target="#FN19">19</ref> In the
    hinterlands of Syria and Mesopotamia, the far-flung territories
    of the patriarchate of Antioch, where the local Christian
    communities straddled the frontiers of the Roman and Persian
    empires, and where ‘Byzantine’ imperial orthodoxy
    was widely rejected by both the so-called
    ‘Monophysite’ ‘Jacobites’ and the
    ‘Dyophysite’ ‘Nestorians’; Syriac was
    the Aramaic dialect which served as the dominant ecclesiastical
    language. In Egypt, Coptic and Greek were the languages of the
    burgeoning Coptic Orthodox Church,<ref target="#FN20">20</ref> while Ethiopic and Armenian
    quickly became the ecclesiastical languages of their own
    respective homelands.<ref target="#FN21">21</ref> Most Syriac, Coptic, Ethiopic and
    Armenian-speaking Christians in the early Islamic period
    accepted Christological formulae articulated the most
    effectively either originally in Greek by Severus of Antioch
    (c. 465-538) and in Syriac by Philoxenus of Mabbug (c.
    440-523), echoing the earlier theology of the Greek-speaking
    St. Cyril of Alexandria (d. 444),<ref target="#FN22">22</ref> or in Syriac by Narsai (d.
    503) and Babai the Great (551/2-628), reflecting the positions
    of Theodore of Mopsuestia (c. 350-428), composed originally in
    Greek a hundred years earlier.<ref target="#FN23">23</ref> After the middle third of
    the sixth century, double hierarchies for the competing
    communions arose in the patriarchates of Alexandria (535) and
    Antioch (557). In Persia, the ancient ‘Church of the
    East’ had its own Metropolitan bishop, sometimes styled
    ‘Catholicos’, and later ‘patriarch’,
    seated in the capital city of Seleucia-Ctesiphon. This church
    accepted the Nicene faith at the synod of 410, and thereafter,
    in a series of councils and synods stretching into the eighth
    century, articulated its own distinctive creed, based on the
    teaching of Theodore of Mopsuestia, which most other churches
    eventually characterized as ‘Nestorian’.<ref target="#FN24">24</ref>
         </p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P7"/>[7] In the
    early years of Umayyad times, all of these ecclesial
    communities had interests in the Holy Land. The see of
    Jerusalem, with its single officially
    ‘Chalcedonian’ hierarchical establishment,
    nevertheless remained the pilgrimage center for all Christians
    and under Muslim rule Syrian and Armenian
    ‘Jacobites’ and ‘Nestorians’ were a
    notable presence in the environs of the church of the
    Anastasis, the Holy Sepulchre.<ref target="#FN25">25</ref> Here the adherents of all
    the principal confessional allegiances met and often argued
    their respective cases.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P8"/>[8]
    Meanwhile, for much of the seventh century, Chalcedonian
    Christians living under Muslim rule in Syria/Palestine, writing
    in Greek, Christian Palestinian Aramaic and Syriac, became very
    much involved in controversy with their own co-religionists
    both at home and abroad over the issues of the Byzantine
    emperors’ promotion of the doctrines of
    ‘Monenergism’ and ‘Monotheletism’ among
    the Chalcedonians in an effort to heal the doctrinal rift
    between them and the so-called ‘Jacobites’ or
    ‘Monophysites’ in the patriarchates of Alexandria
    and Antioch.<ref target="#FN26">26</ref> The chronology of the promotion of the
    doctrine of ‘Monotheletism’ among the Byzantine
    Orthodox spanned the years of the consecutive Persian (614-628)
    and Islamic (634-640) occupations of the territories of
    Antioch, Jerusalem and Alexandria;<ref target="#FN27">27</ref> it was promoted for
    political and strategic reasons during the reign of the emperor
    Heraclius (610-641),<ref target="#FN28">28</ref> and was finally anathematized only at the
    council of Constantinople III (681),<ref target="#FN29">29</ref> well into the
    Umayyad era. In Syria/Palestine, the controversy over this
    issue involved all parties, including most notably both
    ‘Jacobites’ and Chalcedonians, and in due course it
    provided the immediate theological and ecclesial context for
    the emergence of the ‘Melkites’ as a distinct
    denomination of Christians in the world of Islam, among whom
    St. John of Damascus was destined to become the principal
    theological spokesman, as we shall discuss below.</p>
         <head xml:id="HV11N2Griffith4">III</head>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P9"/>[9] Among
    the Greek-speaking theologians of the seventh century who
    attacked ‘Monotheletism’, none was more successful
    in the long run than St. Maximus the Confessor (c. 580-662). It
    seems entirely plausible, in spite of an astonishing
    unwillingness on the part of some scholars seriously to
    consider the pertinent evidence,<ref target="#FN30">30</ref> that like his sometime
    companion and older contemporary, Patriarch Sophronius of
    Jerusalem (c. 560-638), who was born in Damascus,<ref target="#FN31">31</ref>
    Maximus was also a Syro-Palestinian by birth and that his early
    religious formation was not in Constantinople as his
    hagiographical <hi rend="italic">Vita</hi> alleges, but in the Chalcedonian
    monastery of St. Chariton in the Judean desert.<ref target="#FN32">32</ref> This much is
    claimed by virtually contemporary documents in Syriac composed
    by Maximus’ theological adversaries.<ref target="#FN33">33</ref> These
    adversaries, who were in all likelihood themselves staunchly
    ‘Chalcedonian’ Maronites,<ref target="#FN34">34</ref> wrote from within
    the theological context of the Syriac-speaking churches in
    Syria/Palestine which were at the time all under the strong
    influence of the ecclesiastical center of Edessa in Syria,
    where the ‘Jacobites’ formed the dominant
    theological school of thought among the Syriac speakers, with
    the redoubtable Jacob of Edessa (c. 640-708) eventually
    emerging as their principal spokesman.<ref target="#FN35">35</ref>
         </p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P10"/>[10] The
    attraction of ‘Monotheletism’ for Syriac-speaking
    Chalcedonians in the Syro-Palestinian milieu was precisely what
    they undoubtedly perceived to be its ecumenical potential for
    better relations with the dominant ‘Jacobites’ in
    an era of crisis, when religious harmony would be an aid in
    defense of the Christian commonweal, not least in Jerusalem and
    the Holy Land.<ref target="#FN36">36</ref> The crisis was first precipitated by the
    invading Persians from 614 to 628,<ref target="#FN37">37</ref> and it was immediately
    followed a half dozen years later by the final demise of Roman
    rule in the area and the consequent occupation of the Aramean
    homelands by the Muslim Arabs. Arab rule then removed all the
    restraints which the Byzantine emperors had imposed upon
    religious communities who dissented from Chalcedonian
    orthodoxy, so from the mid-seventh century onward the
    Chalcedonians in the world of Islam faced renewed challenges
    from both the ‘Jacobites’ and the
    ‘Nestorians’, both of which groups far outnumbered
    the remaining Chalcedonians among the local Arameans and Arabs,
    especially after the flight of so many ‘Romans’
    (<hi rend="italic">ar-Rūm</hi>)<ref target="#FN38">38</ref> in the aftermath of the conquest,
    an exodus which would reach its apogee in Abbasid times, in the
    first decades of the ninth century.<ref target="#FN39">39</ref>
         </p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P11"/>[11] From
    the late seventh century onward, Syriac and then
    Arabic-speaking ‘Jacobites’ regularly referred to
    their Chalcedonian adversaries within the Islamic world with
    the polemical terms ‘Maximists’ or
    ‘Melkites’; ‘Maximists’ because they
    accepted the Christology of Maximus the Confessor as
    definitive, and ‘Melkites’, or
    ‘Royalists’/‘Imperialists’, because
    they accepted creedal formulae approved by the church council
    called by the Roman emperor Constantine IV, the ecumenical
    council, Constantinople III (681).<ref target="#FN40">40</ref> From the time of that
    council onward, among the Christians in the world of Islam,
    first in Greek and then in Aramaic/Syriac, and eventually in
    Arabic,<ref target="#FN41">41</ref> the see of Jerusalem and its associated
    monastic communities became the champions of imperial,
    Byzantine Orthodoxy throughout Syria, Palestine and Egypt.
    Indeed in due course they became a distinct Christian
    denomination whom both their Christian adversaries and the
    Muslims alike regularly called ‘Melkites’;<ref target="#FN42">42</ref> the
    see of Jerusalem remained their ecclesiastical center, and for
    centuries Jerusalem, and especially the monastery of Mar Saba,
    exerted a strong spiritual and intellectual influence even in
    the ‘Melkite’ communities of the patriarchates of
    Alexandria and Antioch.<ref target="#FN43">43</ref>
         </p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P12"/>[12] St.
    John of Damascus and his Arabic-speaking heirs, like Theodore
    Abū Qurrah (c. 755 — c. 830), were the spokesmen who
    upheld the ‘Melkite’ tradition. They wrote in
    reaction not only to the largely Syriac-speaking
    ‘Jacobites’ and ‘Nestorians’, but also
    against the multiple religious challenges of the era in
    Syria/Palestine, including those coming from Muslims and
    Manichees, as well as from new movements among the Christians
    themselves, such as an enthusiasm for iconophobia which arose
    among some Christians living under Muslim rule in the eighth
    century. When iconoclasm was then adopted as an imperial policy
    in Byzantium in the early eighth century, it exacerbated the
    embarrassment of orthodox Christians living under the Muslims,
    especially in the Holy Land, as we shall see.</p>
         <head xml:id="HV11N2Griffith5">IV</head>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P13"/>[13] St.
    John of Damascus was one of a number of Greek writers in
    Syria/Palestine in the seventh and early eighth centuries who
    defended the cause of imperial, Byzantine orthodoxy as it was
    defined in the first six ecumenical councils. At the time,
    although they lived among the Muslims and had a local audience
    as their primary frame of reference, these writers were in fact
    the most prominent Greek writers of their day. As Cyril Mango
    as notably observed, “practically nothing was written at
    Constantinople down to the 780’s, not even hagiography...
    The most active centre of Greek culture in the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi>
    century lay in Palestine, notably in Jerusalem and the
    neighbouring monasteries.”<ref target="#FN44">44</ref> But these monasteries were
    not simply outposts of Constantinopolitan faith and culture
    left over for a season in a conquered territory, as modern
    Byzantinists sometimes have a tendency to portray them.<ref target="#FN45">45</ref> On the
    contrary, from the eighth century to the mid-eleventh century
    they composed the inspirational center for a wide-ranging
    network of ‘Melkite’ communities in the
    Levant.<ref target="#FN46">46</ref> This much one can glean from a number of
    sources, but one of the most instructive is the <hi rend="italic">Life of St.
    Stephen the Sabaïte</hi> (d. 794) by Leontius of Damascus,
    written in Greek around the year 807 but surviving only in
    Arabic; from it alone, to name no other source, one can trace
    the geographical network of ‘Melkite’ relationships
    between Alexandria, Sinai, Jerusalem, Edessa and
    Baghdad.<ref target="#FN47">47</ref> These locations, all in the Islamic world,
    name the points on the horizon within which the
    ‘Melkites’ thought and wrote, first in Greek and
    then in Arabic, and these same locations provided the immediate
    frame of reference and the cultural context within which the
    ‘Melkites’ defended their faith against their
    Christian, Muslim and Manichaean adversaries. Constantinople
    lay beyond this horizon, but it was arguably never completely
    out of mind, albeit that the doctrinal and political concerns
    of the Roman world would not have been the most pressing issues
    for the ‘Melkites’. Until the early decades of the
    ninth century ‘Melkites’ seem to have had some
    regular contact with Constantinople and even to have exercised
    some considerable influence there, largely through the
    activities of émigré monks.<ref target="#FN48">48</ref> But from around
    the year 825 until well after the mid-tenth century the ties
    seem to have been completely broken; they were restored for a
    season (969-1085) in the territories of Antioch; they were not
    restored in Jerusalem until the reign of the emperor
    Constantine IX Monomachos (1042-1055).<ref target="#FN49">49</ref> But these
    observations take us beyond our immediate concern with the era
    of St. John of Damascus.</p>

            <anchor corresp="P14"/>[14] At
    the turn of the seventh and eighth centuries, during the years
    immediately following the council of Constantinople III (681),
    in Syria/Palestine Anastasius of Sinai (d. after 700) was
    arguably the most significant, proto-‘Melkite’
    writer.<ref target="#FN50">50</ref> In his landmark book, the <hi rend="italic">Hodegos</hi>,
    written in Greek,<ref target="#FN51">51</ref> Anastasius set out Byzantine orthodox
    Christology, largely in reaction to doctrines current in the
    ‘Jacobite’ community, the
    ‘Monophysites’ as he called them, and against the
    ‘Monothelites’, in a way that uncannily anticipated
    difficulties to come.<ref target="#FN52">52</ref> For example, his emphasis on the full
    humanity of Christ led him graphically to portray Jesus’
    tortured and dead body on the cross in an icon which he
    included in his text.<ref target="#FN53">53</ref> In the years to come, this kind of a
    portrayal of the crucifixion would become a point of
    controversy between Christians, Muslims and Christian
    iconophobes, as we shall see below. What is more, in this same
    work Anastasius became one of the first Christian writers on
    record to take cognizance of the religious ideas of the Muslim
    Arabs and even to quote the Qur’ān; he argued that
    the heretical notions of the ‘Jacobites’ had misled
    the Arabs.<ref target="#FN54">54</ref> Another work attributed to Anastasius of Sinai
    is usually called <hi rend="italic">Quaestiones et Responsiones</hi>,
    seemingly also largely excerpted in the pseudo-Athanasian
    <hi rend="italic">Quaestiones ad Antiochum Ducem</hi>. While modern scholars
    have not paid much attention to this widely copied and often
    expanded text, early ‘Melkite’ writers were very
    fond of it and they frequently quoted from it and referred to
    it, not least in Arabic.<ref target="#FN55">55</ref> Clearly Anastasius’ was an
    important voice in the rising generation of
    ‘Melkite’ thinkers who in the seventh century and
    the first half of the eighth century in Syria/Palestine
    articulated the first doctrinal synthesis of what we moderns
    are inclined to call ‘Byzantine Orthodoxy’, but
    which the locals more aptly defended as simply the
    ‘Orthodoxy of the Six Councils’. It was the
    religious backbone of the cultural transformation which
    Byzantinist John Haldon has so evocatively sketched.<ref target="#FN56">56</ref>

            <anchor corresp="P15"/>[15]
    Modern Byzantinists have not been slow to recognize the
    accomplishments of the remarkable, Greek-speaking,
    Syro/Palestinian scholars of the eighth century, with St. John
    of Damascus occupying the first place among them. They included
    poets, hagiographers, hymnographers and theologians of the
    caliber of Andrew of Crete (c. 669 — c. 740), sometime
    ‘Monothelite’ but notable poet and preacher,
    Leontius of Damascus the hagiographer, whom we have already
    mentioned, Cosmas of Maiuma, ‘the Melode’ (c. 675
    — c. 752), and of course John of Damascus himself, to
    name only those with the most immediate name recognition in
    modern times.<ref target="#FN57">57</ref> Indeed there has even been the sense among
    some Byzantinists, while strangely discounting the immediate
    local relevance of their work, nevertheless to recognize the
    defining character of the Syro/Palestinian writers’
    contributions to Orthodox theology in the larger world,
    especially the work of St. John of Damascus,<ref target="#FN58">58</ref> albeit that his
    achievement was only belatedly recognized in Constantinople,
    where in the mid-eighth century he was still being
    characterized as stubbornly
    ‘Saracen-minded’.<ref target="#FN59">59</ref>
         </p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P16"/>[16] Two
    important, but now anonymous, theological reference works in
    Greek of great influence in the promotion of ‘Byzantine
    Orthodoxy’ in our period were produced in this
    Syro/Palestinian milieu, the <hi rend="italic">Doctrina Patrum</hi> and the
    ever popular <hi rend="italic">Sacra Parallela</hi>, both of which served
    Arabic-speaking ‘Melkite’ writers well into the
    Middle Ages. The <hi rend="italic">Doctrina Patrum</hi> has sometimes,
    probably wrongly, been attributed to Anastasius of Sinai; it
    seems to be the older compilation of the two, reflecting the
    teachings of Maximus the Confessor, and those of both the sixth
    century Leontius of Byzantium and Leontius of
    Jerusalem.<ref target="#FN60">60</ref> The compilation of the <hi rend="italic">Sacra
    Parallela</hi> has often been ascribed to St. John of Damascus,
    again probably wrongly, but its doctrinal tenor is certainly
    consistent with his allegiances.<ref target="#FN61">61</ref> Both of these
    <hi rend="italic">florilegia</hi> were of immense significance in shaping the
    doctrinal profile of the ‘Melkite’ community.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P17"/>[17] It
    is not unlikely that one impetus for the remarkable
    efflorescence of ‘Melkite’ thought in
    Syria/Palestine in the first half of the eighth century was the
    new stability brought to ecclesiastical affairs in Jerusalem by
    the inception of the thirty year reign of Patriarch John V
    (705-735) at the beginning of the century, coming in the wake
    of the ecclesiastical and civil crises of episcopal succession
    in Jerusalem during the almost seventy years which followed the
    death of Patriarch Sophronius (d. 638)<ref target="#FN62">62</ref> and the formal
    separation of the Orient from Roman government brought about by
    inauguration of the new Islamic hegemony in the area. Another
    factor which must also have influenced especially the defensive
    and reactive intellectual posture of the first
    ‘Melkite’ theologians and prompted their
    summarizing and systematizing efforts, most notably those of
    St. John of Damascus, was the contemporary growth and
    development not only of the doctrines of their newly socially
    empowered Christian adversaries but also of the emergence and
    active careers of new Islamic religious thinkers as well.</p>

         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P18"/>[18] As
    was noted at the beginning of this essay, the last years of the
    seventh century and the first quarter of the eighth century
    witnessed the campaign of the Umayyad caliphs, especially
    ‘Abd al-Malik and his sons and successors, publicly and
    symbolically to claim the Arab occupied territories for Islam,
    and especially the cities of Jerusalem and Damascus. This
    effort went hand in hand with important steps in the growth and
    development of early Islamic religious thought. In the
    beginning, more theoretical considerations had been
    overshadowed by what moderns would call political concerns. But
    concomitant with the elaboration of different ideas about how
    the Islamic community should be governed after the death of the
    prophet Mu<hi rend="u">h</hi>ammad, the nascent class of
    Muslim ‘scholars’ (<hi rend="italic">ulamā’</hi>) in
    the caliphate were already devising the methods of transmitting
    the authoritative prophetic traditions (<hi rend="italic">
               <hi rend="u">h</hi>adīth</hi>, pl., <hi rend="italic">a</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">
               <hi rend="u">h</hi>ādīth</hi>) which for the burgeoning
    majority of the so-called ‘Sunnī’ Muslims
    would go together with the Qur’ān as the principal
    sources for determining both the faith and the civil order of
    the dominant Islamic community (<hi rend="italic">ummah</hi>).<ref target="#FN63">63</ref> At the same
    time, the authors of the early biographies of the prophet
    Mu<hi rend="u">h</hi>ammad, such as Mu<hi rend="u">h</hi>ammad ibn Is<hi rend="u">h</hi>āq (d.
    767), a near contemporary of St. John of Damascus, and the
    authors of the first Qur’ān commentaries and the
    standard accounts of the earliest exploits of the
    Muslims,<ref target="#FN64">64</ref> were structuring their narratives in an
    obviously apologetic and even polemic cast, clearly making
    claims for the religious verisimilitude of Islam
    vis-à-vis the claims of the Jews and Christians,
    following the patterns of the earlier Jewish and Christian
    narratives according to a suitably altered, Islamic
    perspective. A number of these early scholars and writers lived
    in Damascus in St. John of Damascus’ lifetime.<ref target="#FN65">65</ref> So
    pronounced was the apologetic penchant in their works that the
    modern scholar who has done the most to make the point clear to
    latter day readers, John Wansbrough, has characterized the
    whole enterprise and the era itself as the <hi rend="italic">Sectarian
    Milieu</hi> of early Islam.<ref target="#FN66">66</ref>
         </p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P19"/>[19] By
    St. John of Damascus’ day certain more theoretical
    religious concerns were already emerging among Muslim
    intellectuals which would have interesting analogues in
    John’s own work. Some of the thinkers whose names are
    prominent in the early intellectual history of Islam and who
    were St. John’s contemporaries include Ma‛bad
    al-Juhanī (d. 704), al-<hi rend="u">H</hi>asan
    al-Ba<hi rend="u">s</hi>rī (642-728), Ghaylān
    ad-Dimashqī (d.c. 743), Jahm ibn <hi rend="u">S</hi>afwān (d. 745), Wā<hi rend="u">s</hi>il ibn ‛A <hi rend="u">t</hi>a’
    (d. 748) and ʿAmr ibn
    ʿUbayd (d. 762). These were the thinkers of
    record who were raising questions and taking positions on the
    controversial issues of the day among Muslims such as the
    freedom of the will, the proper understanding of God’s
    attributes, the status of the Qur’ān as the Word of
    God and the rightful stance to be taken toward governmental
    authority.<ref target="#FN67">67</ref> Most of these men were associated in one way
    or another with the rising ‘Mu‛tazilite’
    movement among the early practitioners of the Islamic
    <hi rend="italic">‛ilm al-kalām</hi>, the dialogic science of
    discussing and understanding points of religious doctrine
    according to the principles of theoretical Arabic grammar,
    itself in the early stages of development at the time.<ref target="#FN68">68</ref> The
    names of all of these thinkers and their ideas were well known
    in Umayyad Damascus and much discussed at the caliphal court;
    there is every reason to think that St. John of Damascus would
    therefore have been thoroughly familiar with them, especially
    since many of their issues <hi rend="italic">mutatis mutandis</hi> were of
    much concern to him in his own Christian thought.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P20"/>[20]
    Muslims and ‘Melkites’ had some doctrinal
    adversaries in common in the eighth century and the scholars of
    both communities devoted considerable attention to refuting
    them. The most prominent and persistent of these adversaries
    were the Manichees, whom the Arabic-speaking Muslims classed
    among the dualist freethinkers, a category they designated by
    an originally Persian term taken over into Arabic as
    <hi rend="italic">zindīq</hi> (pl. <hi rend="italic">zanādiqah</hi>).<ref target="#FN69">69</ref> Greek,
    Syriac, and even Latin-speaking Christians had long been
    composing tracts against the Manichees; in Syriac Christian
    texts they were classed among the
    ‘gentiles’,<ref target="#FN70">70</ref> called <hi rend="italic">
               <hi rend="u">h</hi>anpê</hi> (sing. <hi rend="italic">
               <hi rend="u">h</hi>anpâ</hi>) in Syriac, those who were neither
    Jews nor Christians and who worshipped gods considered to be
    strange.<ref target="#FN71">71</ref> In Syria/Palestine in the eighth and ninth
    centuries, Manichaean doctrines proved to be very attractive to
    many intellectuals in both the Christian and the Islamic
    communities. It was for this reason that a considerable number
    of both Christian and Muslim polemicists paid close attention
    to the refutation of Manichaean doctrines and composed a good
    number of texts against them, including St. John of Damascus,
    who addressed the problem in a number of his works.<ref target="#FN72">72</ref>

    Modern scholars, and even some Medieval Muslim ones, have made
    efforts to find connections and influences between contemporary
    Christian thinkers of the east, and particularly St. John of
    Damascus, and some of the early Muslim scholars whom we have
    named above.<ref target="#FN73">73</ref> This has been especially the case in regard to
    the debate which arose among the Muslims in the early eighth
    century between the upholders of the doctrine of the freedom of
    human will, the so-called ‘Qadarites’
    (<hi rend="italic">al-qadariyyah</hi>), and the advocates of predestination,
    the so-called ‘Mujbirites’
    (<hi rend="italic">al-mujbirah/al-jabriyyah</hi>), as their adversaries
    called them, or, as they would have referred to themselves,
    ‘the people of determination’ (<hi rend="italic">ahl
    al-ithbāt</hi>), meaning those who maintain that the
    determination of human actions belongs to God alone.<ref target="#FN74">74</ref>
         </p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P22"/>[22]
    Modern scholars such as Morris Seale and Harry Austryn Wolfson
    have argued that the ‘Qadarites’ were influenced by
    contemporary Christian ideas and terms about the freedom of the
    will of the sort that can be found in the works of St. John of
    Damascus.<ref target="#FN75">75</ref> Meanwhile, Michael Cook has proposed that at
    the same time there was a widespread determinist mood abroad in
    Umayyad times, even in Christian circles and especially among
    Syriac-speaking thinkers such as Jacob of Edessa, which could
    have had an influence on the Muslim determinists.<ref target="#FN76">76</ref> In the
    same vein, Shlomo Pines suggested that there are parallels to
    be observed in the methodological composition of the works of
    the early Muslim <hi rend="italic">mutakallimūn</hi>, the practitioners
    of the apologetic <hi rend="italic">‛ilm al-kalām</hi>, especially
    among the ‘Mu‛tazilites’, and the
    compositional procedures at work in St. John of Damascus’
    largely apologetic <hi rend="italic">De Fide Orthodoxa</hi>; he argued that
    the parallels may disclose influence or dependence.<ref target="#FN77">77</ref>
    Contrariwise, Carl Becker thought that it was St. John of
    Damascus who reacted to the Muslim thinkers, all of whom he
    took to be determinists, rather than the other way around,
    especially in the discussion about the freedom of the
    will.<ref target="#FN78">78</ref> While none of these allegations can be pressed
    with any confidence, they do nevertheless all call attention to
    the fact that some of the intellectual concerns both of St.
    John of Damascus and of his Muslim contemporaries were in a
    kind of sympathetic vibration, even if he and the Muslims were
    not in direct dialogue with one another.</p>
         <head xml:id="HV11N2Griffith7">VI</head>

            <anchor corresp="P23"/>[23]
    Everything we know about the life and works of St. John of
    Damascus shows how well he and his concerns fit within the
    intellectual and cultural world of Syria/Palestine in Umayyad
    times, from the perspective of both its Christian and its
    Islamic frames of reference.<ref target="#FN79">79</ref> In this context, one can readily
    see that John wrote with a pastoral concern for the whole
    ‘Melkite’ church and not just for monks,<ref target="#FN80">80</ref> albeit
    that the monks of Jerusalem and of the monasteries of the
    Judean desert, especially the monastery of Mar Saba, were the
    principal teachers of the ‘Melkites’.<ref target="#FN81">81</ref>
    Concomitantly, John shows little or no concern in his works for
    Constantinople or Byzantium,<ref target="#FN82">82</ref> where what he wrote came to be
    appreciated only long after his death and where in his lifetime
    he was despised. It is especially important to make this point
    because the prevailing view among modern scholars to the
    contrary is still strongly upheld. In fact it is a thoroughly
    anachronistic view, based on a reading of John’s works
    through lenses crafted long after his time in Byzantium and
    long after the final triumph of ‘Orthodoxy’ in
    Constantinople in the ninth century. This approach co-opts John
    of Damascus out of his own milieu and into a Byzantine frame of
    reference which was never his own, often discounting the issues
    which were in fact most important to him and highlighting
    others which reflect more the concerns of latter day scholars
    of Byzantine theology.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P24"/>[24] In
    all likelihood, given the evidence of his name and what we know
    of the history of his family, John was of Aramaean, maybe even
    Arab stock. It is notable that in ‘Melkite’ Arabic
    sources neither he nor his ancestors are ever listed among the
    Romans (<hi rend="italic">ar-Rūm</hi>), or the
    ‘Byzantines’,<ref target="#FN83">83</ref> as modern historians prefer to
    call them. Rather, he came from an indigenous family whose
    members enjoyed a high civil status, both under Roman rule and
    under the early caliphs.<ref target="#FN84">84</ref> The fact that John wrote only in
    Greek and not, so far as we know, in Aramaic or Arabic is no
    indication of Greek ancestry; Greek was the liturgical and
    scholarly language of choice for all the members of his church
    during his lifetime. Greek inscriptions are to be found in
    Arabian churches built or restored in the eighth century, well
    beyond the date of St. John of Damascus’ demise.<ref target="#FN85">85</ref> Only
    in the next generation, did the ‘Melkites’ adopt
    Arabic as an ecclesiastical language, but even then they did
    not simply drop Greek or Christian Palestinian Aramaic, albeit
    that the cultivation of Greek letters underwent an eclipse in
    their communities thereafter.<ref target="#FN86">86</ref> By the tenth century the
    ‘Melkites’ were already translating the most
    important of St. John of Damascus’ works into
    Arabic.<ref target="#FN87">87</ref>
         </p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P25"/>[25] Here
    is not the place to delve into the biography of St. John of
    Damascus in any detail, or to study his works closely; these
    considerations are among the topics assigned to other scholars
    participating in the conference. Suffice it now to call
    attention to certain aspects of St. John’s second career,
    his entrance into the monastic life in the Holy Land and his
    pastorally motivated apostolate of the pen in the service of
    the Patriarch of Jerusalem, John V (705-735). This was the
    patriarch who finally consolidated ecclesiastical affairs in
    Jerusalem after the disruptions and vacancies caused by the
    Islamic conquest just over sixty years earlier.<ref target="#FN88">88</ref> Once again,
    albeit in reduced circumstances, and due in large part to the
    efforts of Patriarch John V, Jerusalem would become in fact as
    well as in name, ‘the mother of churches’, as Cyril
    of Scythopolis had called her in the sixth century,<ref target="#FN89">89</ref> a
    title which in later Islamic times ‘Melkite’
    writers loved to apply to her in their efforts to counter
    Muslim claims to the Holy City,<ref target="#FN90">90</ref> when Jerusalem had become
    the <hi rend="italic">de facto</hi> if not the <hi rend="italic">de jure</hi> center of
    Orthodox life in the caliphate.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P26"/>[26] We
    do not know just when St. John left his civil servant career in
    Damascus to come to Jerusalem to enter the monastic life. The
    common opinion seems to be that the move coincided with the
    beginning of the reign of the caliph al-Walīd
    (705-715),<ref target="#FN91">91</ref> when this Umayyad prince mandated the change
    from Greek to Arabic in the chancery
    (<hi rend="italic">ad-dīwān</hi>) of the caliphate and began the
    construction of the Umayyad Mosque on the site of
    Damascus’ earlier Church of St. John the Baptist. (In
    this connection one notices in passing that the reigns of
    Caliph al-Walīd and Patriarch John V began in the same
    year, 705.) Neither do we know for sure to which of the Holy
    Land monasteries John of Damascus repaired. Hagiographical
    tradition claims him for a monk of Mar Saba monastery in the
    Judean desert, but recent scholarly inquiry has cast some doubt
    on the historicity of this claim.<ref target="#FN92">92</ref> What seems to be settled is
    that Patriarch John V ordained John of Damascus a priest in
    Jerusalem not too long after the beginning of the
    patriarch’s reign and that St. John spent his remaining
    years composing both theological tracts and religious poetry
    and hymnody in Greek to meet the needs of the local church of
    Jerusalem as well as the wider network of
    ‘Melkites’ in the caliphate who looked to Jerusalem
    and her monastic communities for guidance.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P27"/>[27] The
    years of St. John of Damascus’ monastic career correspond
    both with the years of the culminating development of the
    definitive ‘Melkite’ Christological and canonical
    self-definition over against the ‘Nestorian’ and
    ‘Jacobite’ challenges, largely accomplished in
    John’s own works, and the period of the burgeoning of the
    new Islamic sciences and the campaign of the Umayyad caliphs to
    claim the public domain for Islam. It is also the era in which
    the first Christian responses in Greek and Syriac to the
    religious challenge of Islam appeared, and to this enterprise
    St. John also made a major contribution as is well known.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P28"/>[28] It
    is striking how readily the topical profile of St. John of
    Damascus’ works corresponds both sociologically and
    theologically with the church-defining concerns of the
    Christian communities in Syria/Palestine in the days of his
    Jerusalem ministry. In particular, the refutation of
    Mesallians, Monotheletes, Jacobites, Nestorians and Manichees,
    all active in his immediate milieu, pressingly concerned him.
    Nowhere else in the world of Chalcedonian Orthodoxy at the time
    was the press of these challenges, in the ensemble and in just
    this particular topical array, so acutely a problem. There
    seems to have been a special urgency on St. John’s part,
    both definitively and summarily to present systematically
    coherent resolutions to these issues in a hostile environment,
    largely in terms borrowed from what he consistently represented
    as the teaching of the fathers.<ref target="#FN93">93</ref> Even his signature topic as
    far as many modern scholars are concerned, the theology of the
    holy icons, had a local as well as a broader, even
    Constantinopolitan, point of reference, as we shall see.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P29"/>[29] St.
    John of Damascus’ response to the religious challenge of
    the Muslims was not limited to the few works in which he
    explicitly addressed Islam, such as Chapter 100 of the <hi rend="italic">De
    Haeresibus</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Disputation between a Saracen and a
    Christian</hi>.<ref target="#FN94">94</ref> Rather, one must consider that the full range
    of the developing Islamic sciences in the first half of the
    eighth century presented an almost unprecedented, comprehensive
    challenge both to Christianity’s principal articles of
    faith and to the Christian way of life. In response, the
    challenge called for a comprehensive, summary exposition of the
    truths of Christian faith, along with a compendium of
    definitions of the philosophical terms in which the Christian
    doctrines were expressed, and a catalog of the errors in
    refutation of which many of the doctrines were first
    articulated. John of Damascus’ <hi rend="italic">Pēgē
    Gnoseos</hi> answered this need for the ‘Melkites’
    and Theodore Bar Kônî’s <hi rend="italic">Scholion</hi>
    served the same purpose for the ‘Nestorians’. Among
    the ‘Jacobites’, the works of Jacob of Edessa (d.
    708)<ref target="#FN95">95</ref> and George, Bishop of the Arabs, (d.
    724)<ref target="#FN96">96</ref> met this challenge, together with the
    remarkable promotion of Aristotelian logic in this community,
    in translations, commentaries and lexicons,<ref target="#FN97">97</ref> geared
    principally to the precise definition and deployment of the
    philosophical terms used in Christology, the issue which most
    poignantly both divided the Christians and aroused the obloquy
    of the Muslims. In the Islamic milieu, the hostile intellectual
    circumstances required the Christian controversialists of each
    denomination summarily to address not only the challenges of
    Islam but in virtually the same process also to provide
    responses to their own intra-Christian adversaries. In later
    times Muslim writers would focus their anti-Christian polemic
    on precisely these church-dividing differences in Christian
    thought and allegiance.<ref target="#FN98">98</ref>

    Throughout most of the seventh century and for the better part
    of the eighth century, the Orthodox monks of Syria/Palestine
    found themselves perennially in opposition to the religious and
    civil authorities in Byzantine Constantinople<ref target="#FN99">99</ref> who promoted
    doctrines and ecclesiastical policies which would finally be
    condemned as heretical in Ecumenical Councils in 681
    (Monotheletism) and 787 (Iconoclasm) respectively, but which
    were left behind completely only with the ‘Triumph of
    Orthodoxy’ in the ninth century (843),<ref target="#FN100">100</ref> well into
    the classical period of Islamic culture, in which the churches
    of the Orient were by then thoroughly immersed. St. John of
    Damascus vigorously combated both of these heresies which had
    arisen in the Chalcedonian community, but in the instance of
    his defense of the veneration of the holy icons he wrote in the
    context of opposition both from a significant number Christians
    in Syria/Palestine, who in the face of Jewish and Islamic
    polemic were becoming iconophobic and abandoning the practice
    of publicly venerating the cross and the icons,<ref target="#FN101">101</ref> as well as
    from reports of the imperial policy of iconoclasm promoted by
    the Byzantine emperor in Constantinople.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P31"/>[31] In
    light of this double frame of reference, it seems not
    unreasonable to suppose that the impetus for St. John of
    Damascus’ composition of his <hi rend="italic">Orations against the
    Calumniators of the Icons</hi> was supplied by news reaching
    Jerusalem of the iconoclastic policies dramatically inaugurated
    in Constantinople by the emperor Leo III (717-741) in the year
    726.<ref target="#FN102">102</ref> In Jerusalem and its environs, the pastoral
    problem of how to deal with iconophobic Christians in the
    Islamic milieu seems already to have arisen somewhat earlier in
    the century.<ref target="#FN103">103</ref> The arrival of the news of
    Constantinople’s iconoclastic policies could only have
    exacerbated the already existing local problem. From this
    perspective, one might reasonably conclude that even St.
    John’s <hi rend="italic">Orations against the Calumniators of the
    Icons</hi>, like his other works, were written with an audience
    of ‘Melkites’ in Syria/Palestine primarily in mind.
    They seem to have found an audience in Byzantium only in the
    next century.<ref target="#FN104">104</ref> And even in Syria/Palestine among the
    ‘Melkites’, John’s was perhaps only a
    minority voice on this issue in his lifetime;<ref target="#FN105">105</ref> it was
    taken up again with vigor in the next generation by Theodore
    Abū Qurrah (c. 755 — c. 830) in his Arabic tract on
    the duty of Christians in the caliphate to make prostration to
    the cross and to the holy icons of Christ and his saints, in
    spite of opposition and obloquy from “anti-Christians,
    especially ones claiming to have in hand a scripture sent down
    from God.”<ref target="#FN106">106</ref> In this manner the teaching of St. John
    of Damascus on the holy icons came to inform
    ‘Melkite’ Orthodoxy for generations to come,
    without any reference at all until the tenth century,
    especially in Arabic sources, to the teaching of
    Byzantium’s seventh Ecumenical Council, Nicea II, in
    787.<ref target="#FN107">107</ref>
         </p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P32"/>[32] It
    has been the thesis of the present communication that the
    interests of the emerging community of ‘Melkite’,
    Orthodox Christians in the Umayyad era in Syria/Palestine
    furnish the most immediate frame of reference for appreciating
    the significance of the works of St. John of Damascus in his
    lifetime. The fact that in later times his works achieved a
    defining status in the Greek Orthodox Church of Byzantium
    should not prevent modern scholars from looking beyond that
    nearer horizon to our own times for the more distant one within
    which St. John actually produced his works in his own Islamic
    homeland in the first half of the eighth century.
    Anachronistically to consider John and his works only from the
    perspective of the later synthesis of Orthodox theology, of
    which his works eventually came to form an important part, is
    to obscure their crucial role in providing the basic principles
    for the self-definition of ‘Melkite’ Orthodoxy in
    his own immediate environment, in the world of Islam. When we
    read his works with a heightened understanding of their own
    immediate context, they present us in the ensemble with a
    theological and ecclesial profile in which we can recognize the
    emerging contours of the Orthodox Church in Syria in the
    Umayyad era. In later years, in Abbasid times (750-1258),
    Arabic-speaking, ‘Melkite’ theologians in the
    caliphate continued St. John of Damascus’ theological
    work, developing it to respond more pointedly to the challenges
    of Muslims.<ref target="#FN108">108</ref> But that is a story for another
    venue.</p>_______<lb/>

            <ref target="#FNRef42">42</ref> Two difficulties beset the use of the term
    ‘Melkites’. On the one hand, scholars have
    regularly used the term anachronistically to refer to the
    ‘Chalcedonians’ from the fifth century onward,
    whereas it did not in fact come into currency until well after
    the time of Constantinople III in 681 and its primary reference
    was to those Christians in the Islamic world who accepted the
    teachings of that council. On the other hand, in modern times
    the term has been used almost exclusively to refer to members
    of this community who came into union with the see of Rome in
    the eighteenth century. See Sidney H. Griffith, “The
    Church of Jerusalem and the ‘Melkites’: The Making

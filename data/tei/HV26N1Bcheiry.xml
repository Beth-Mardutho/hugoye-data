                           > Afrām Barṣawm was born in 1887, in Mosul,
                            Iraq. In 1905 he joined the monastery of al-Zaʿfarān in Mardin,
                            southeast Turkey. He was ordinated a priest in 1908, and in 1911 he
                            became responsible for managing the monastery press. In the same year,
                            he visited the monasteries and churches in southeast Turkey. In 1913 he
                            traveled to Europe where he examined Syriac manuscripts in some
                            libraries of Europe. In 1918, Afrām Barṣawm was consecrated by Patriarch
                            Elias III as metropolitan of Syria and Lebanon. In 1919, he represented
                            the national rights of the Syrian community in the peace settlement in
                            Paris. After the death of Patriarch Elias III in 1932, the synod of
                            bishops elected Afrām Barṣawm a Patriarch. Barṣawm died on June 23<hi

                    Among these leaves is a fragment containing West-Syriac Synodal Decrees of
                    Callinicos 818. This rediscovered document reveals the dynamics of ecclesial
                    events and positions during the synod and the development of these affairs after
                    the synod. Therefore, this article aims to present the Syriac text with an
                    English translation of the synodal decrees of Callinicos 818, followed by
                    observation and commentary. It sheds some light on the missing manuscript of
                    “the Canonical Collection of Basibrīnā” and the recent rediscovery of a few
                    leaves from this manuscript.</p>

                    being the 26th bishop the patriarch had ordained. Bishop Dawud, one of the best

                    his commemoration is mentioned on February 4. He bequeathed his books and other

                    A12006. The acquisition of these leaves, together with two other Syriac

                    then became the Syriac Orthodox archbishop of Syria and Lebanon. From the
                    chronology of his life, we know that after his journey to Geneva and Lausanne as
                    an apostolic delegate to the World Conference on Faith and Order (August 3–21,
                    1927), Afrām Barṣawm came as an emissary of the Patriarch to the United States,
                    where he investigated the condition of the Syriac Orthodox Church, consecrated
                    three new churches, and ordained new priests. In the USA, Afrām Barṣawm gave
                    lectures on the Syriac language and literature at Providence University and the
                    University of Chicago and served at the Oriental Institute of the latter
                    institution until his return in 1929. The purchase of the Syriac manuscripts
                    occurred most probably while he was visiting Chicago.</p>

                    the leaves, such as wear, tears, cuts, wrinkling, discoloring, and holes. Also,

                    <p xml:lang="en">During the end of the eighth and early ninth centuries,
                        a liturgical controversy arose within the Syrian Orthodox Church, leading to
                        a near schism. The Eucharistic formula of the fraction that has been used in
                        the Syriac liturgy: “We break <hi rend="italic">the heavenly bread,</hi> and
                        we sign the holy chalice of salvation, in the name of the Father, Son, and
                        the Holy Spirit,” became a subject of a debate among the Syriac Orthodox
                        Church. Some of the Syriac bishops and clergy insisted that the formula
                        “heavenly bread” would suggest a Nestorian “heresy.” According to them,
                        breaking the “heavenly bread”, already consecrated, and thus becoming the
                        Body of Christ, would imply that the person of Christ is divided into two
                        persons. So, this would mean that “the heavenly Bread” is recognized as
                        another son, distinct from the Second Person of the Holy Trinity.<note

                    <p xml:lang="en">The Syriac Orthodox Patriarch Cyriacus of Tikrit (793–817)
                        forbade the priests he ordained from using this phrase. In a synod at Beṯ
                        Botīn near Harran in 794, it was decided that the clergy may use the phrase.
                        However, in the Synod of Beṯ Gabrīn in 808, the use of the phrase “the
                        heavenly bread” was condemned, and the monks of the Monastery of Gūbō Baroyō
                        (The Outer Pit Monastery) near Mabbugh were excommunicated for their refusal
                        to obey the patriarch. Opponents of the patriarch elected a rival patriarch
                        named Abīram from the Monastery of Qartmin who consecrated several bishops
                        and supported the use of the phrase “the heavenly bread”.<note place="foot"

                        to discuss issues and controversies. In the end, the bishops agreed and
                        stated that the expression of “the heavenly bread” is indeed the body of the

                        called and brought to the synod, where the bishops were gathered, and he was
                        ordained a patriarch by forty-eight bishops. After his ordination, a

                    decided that we should meet and return and commanded us all to join him.
                    Therefore, we take as an example in our administrating, ruling, and regulating
                    (agreement), the good setting of the church canons, and the holy forefathers’
                    conduct. We all know that the church of God has operated since ancient times
                    with concord and without conflict. So that if some of them said something, some
                    others have kept silent, they never quarreled or held each other with contempt
                    regarding these matters until these days. This is
                    what we decided with no way of doubt in any form, that the heavenly bread is
                    truly and actually the holy body of the Son of God that we receive at the holy
                    altars. We all confess this, with the threat of ex-communication against whoever
                    does not confess with us that He (the Son of God) is the heavenly bread that we
                    obtain from the holy altars, according to the teaching of the great saint,

                            The Chronicle of Michael the Syrian mentions the following regarding
                            Philoxenus, bishop of Nisibis: “In the same year (828 A.D.) a synod of
                            forty bishops together with Patriarch Dionysius, assembled in (the
                            Monastery of) Euspholis near Rīšʿaynā, concerning Philoxenus (bishop) of
                            Nisibis, who was removed from his see. His accusers were Nūnā (Nunnus),
                            archdeacon of Nisibis, and Abū Rayṭā of Tikrit, who were both sages, and
                            philosophers. However, when he was called to attend the synod and did
                            not come and went to Nisibis without permission, the synod
                            excommunicated him together with Abiram, but then these two expelled men
                            came into agreement with each

                <p>To the children of the Heavenly Father and brothers
                    and heirs of Christ, companions of the Holy Spirit through whom you have been
                    called to eternal life and to the incorruptible inheritance, where you have
                    gladly laid the neck of your mind under the yoke of the evangelical
                    commandments; to the illustrious and purifying orders of the glorious company of
                    priests, deacons, and the rest of the holy clergy and the faithful people who in
                    every city and every country are fulfilling their temporary abode,—Dionysius who
                    is, by divine grace, the patriarch of the apostolic see of Antioch, the City of
                    God, and this holy and peaceful synod in the victorious and God-loving city of
                    the people of Qāllīnīqūs through Christ who is our peace, who are gathered all
                    of one and the same mind and so made that we can say we desire the same thing,
                    not only the dignity of sitting together (but the company) of His wonderful
                    Father and the Holy Spirit. May peace ever abound in your souls with the good
                    hope of redemption. </p>
                <p>Therefore, my beloved ones, we were gathered to
                    examine the transgression and the rise of destruction in the Holy Church, to
                    spread and provide harmony to its believing masses and to join and strengthen
                    the members who have been detached from its honorable body whose head is Christ,
                    which by Him is framed and linked together conveniently and suitably, fastening,
                    and joining and setting firmly everyone in good order in the proper places. (In
                    all this) we have worked with all the necessary patience and endurance to
                    practice and fulfill these (canons) by acts. </p>
                <p>However, it is known that our weakness is supported
                    by the divine grace so that it is not we but rather the divine grace which
                    directs the actions through our hands because it is not always in the hands but
                    the work which acts as well as the peace and the sustenance of the holy
                    churches. For this reason, we are confident even though we believe that we are
                    useless and poor men and in this time without order—so confused, even more than
                    of all times, as we adjudge it. The rebellion and disobedience increased. In it,
                    the love of many grew cold according to the evangelical word<note place="foot"

                    decisions of Callinicos 818, on behalf of “the
                    rest of the sons of the monastery of Gūbō Baroyō”. These are Bishop Ḥabīb,

                    Cyriacus of Tikrit and later against Patriarch Dionysius I Tel-Maḥroyō and

                            bread”, he became enraged. Therefore, when the damned one saw that he
                            had not reached the hope, he had been waiting for, he gathered his
                            partisans and said (to them): Look what the bishops have done. They
                            chose a head from the monastery and the city that has rejected the
                            expression "(we break) the heavenly bread." I adjure you by the word of
                            God that after my death, you shall not deposit my body in the grave
                            until you have made a head to replace me, nor shall you be reconciled

                <head>Conclusion</head>
                <p xml:lang="en">There is more than one reason to re-publish and edit this
                    document. First, it is a rediscovery of a historical document that was thought
                    of as lost. It is important to return to the original manuscript to examine the
                    transcript of Afrām Barṣawm which contained several inaccuracies. Moreover, the
                    importance of this document lies in the fact that it reveals (when intersected
                    with the Chronicle of Michael the Syrian) the dynamics of ecclesial events and
                    positions that occurred during the convening of the Synod of Callinicos 818 and
                    the development of these positions such as of the monks and bishops from the
                    Monastery of Gūbō Baroyō. Furthermore, the synodal letter is not identical to
                    the one found in the Chronicle of Michael the Syrian, and this opens a general
                    question of how far the documentation of synodal acts and letters are actually
                    representing the actual documents issued by the synod.</p>

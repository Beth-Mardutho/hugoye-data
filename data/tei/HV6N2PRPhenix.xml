         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P1"/>[1] Among
    Semitic languages, the pedagogy of Syriac, a dialect of
    Aramaic, suffers because its attested written artifacts fall
    well beyond the mainstream interests of students of the Ancient
    Near East on the one hand; on the other hand the pillars of
    modern Near Eastern studies do not consider Syriac (and its
    users) at all relevant. Hence there is little incentive to
    produce an introduction to Syriac that, like many competent
    grammars of Biblical Hebrew and Modern Standard Arabic,
    adequately guides students, with drills and exercises, through
    its grammatical details and stylistic intricacies. No English
    introduction to Syriac presents all of the basics as well as
    many of the significant details. In the interest of students of
    comparative Semitics, no textbook takes into account the needs
    of those who study Syriac as an Aramaic dialect. These are some
    of the needs that need to be met to further Syriac studies.
    Robinson's original <hi rend="italic">Paradigms and Exercises in Syriac
    Grammar</hi> was never meant to meet these needs. Coakley's
    fifth edition of Robinson is a much-needed correction to this
    English workhorse of Syriac studies that has influenced
    subsequent publications. Yet the basic need of a sound
    introduction is still not addressed thereby.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P2"/>[2] Coakley
    has made some positive and useful improvements to one of the
    better-known English manuals of Syriac language and has
    presented a solid piece of work commendable for its accuracy,
    concision, and clarity. The book is pocket size, but still
    rather expensive. It is also practically free of typographical
    errors in the English and the Syriac, demonstrating the care
    that Coakley took to present a readable and accurate
    textbook.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P3"/>[3] The
    preface touts this revision as a "simple and friendly
    introduction" to Syriac. Yet the author sees the limitations of
    Robinson's design. To supplement the gaps in Robinson, Coakley
    advises the student to refer to Nöldeke's <hi rend="italic">Compendious
    Syriac Grammar</hi>. While this is a theoretical possibility for
    advanced students, it is not a pedagogically sound one for
    beginners. By analogy, an introduction to Biblical Hebrew
    structured in such a way that the student "fills in the gaps"
    with Gesenius or Joüon places this pedagogy in some
    perspective.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P4"/>[4]
    Coakley's edition follows Robinson's layout fairly closely with
    a few significant changes, some of which are improvements. The
    grammar is divided into twenty-nine sections. The first section
    presents a brief introduction to the historical and comparative
    background of Syriac in the Aramaic and wider Semitic context,
    along with a brief statement on the relationship between 'East'
    and 'West' Syriac. This introduction is clear and concise. More
    could have been said about the exact relationships between
    Syriac and the other dialects of Aramaic. The presentation
    suggests that there was a stage when a single dialect of
    Aramaic was spoken throughout Southwest Asia. This is unlikely.
    Imperial Aramaic was employed in the Achaemenid Empire (539-332
    BC) as the official language of the Mesopotamian satrapies.
    Standard Literary Aramaic was a language of wider written
    communication in the Hellenistic Period (fourth to first
    centuries BC). The distribution of both Imperial Aramaic and
    SLA as spoken languages remains unknown. In all periods other
    dialects of Aramaic are attested in more restricted
    geographical distributions.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P5"/>[5]
    Following this introduction is a good presentation of
    <hi rend="italic">sertā</hi>, the West Syriac script used in this book.
    Coakley presents the letters in their various forms in a table
    and usefully explains how to write each letter, illustrating
    his remarks with easy to read handwritten examples. This is a
    helpful presentation of the writing system, although it should
    be supplemented by handwriting exercises. The section ends with
    a discussion of the <hi rend="italic">syāmê</hi>, inaccurately
    translated as "things placed," which would be in Syriac
    <hi rend="italic">sīmātā</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Syāmê</hi> in this
    instance means 'symbols' and is an elliptical expression for
    <hi rend="italic">syāmê dnūqzê</hi> 'symbols of
    (grammatical) points.' Coakley includes two good transcription
    exercises at the end of this section and of section three, from
    <hi rend="italic">sertā</hi> script into Latin transcription and
    vice-versa. He provides the Latin consonant and vowel
    equivalents in two tables. These are useful exercises as they
    reinforce the values of the letters and provide some
    interaction with the "sounds" of Syriac. Learning the relevant
    Latin transcription system is also standard for most other
    grammars in Semitic languages.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P6"/>[6] The
    vowels and vowel orthography are deferred to the end of section
    three, which treats pronunciation. Coakley uses the Western
    vocalization throughout, but transcribes <hi rend="italic">zqāpā</hi>
    (West Syriac /ō/) as /ā/, and also maintains the East
    Syriac orthographic distinction between /o/ and /u/. This is an
    example of adopting a "mixed" phonology, for which there is
    precedent. (However, other features distinguishing between West
    and East Syriac are adopted without informing the student. For
    example, the vowel of the G Durative [<hi rend="italic">pe<hi rend="sup">c</hi>al</hi>
    imperfect] prefix of verbs I-ālaph shows allophonic
    distribution in West Syriac but not in East Syriac.) The
    differences between the five- and seven-vowel systems are
    summarized but the vowel names are not provided. The rest of
    section three covers the consonantal system of Syriac, except
    that the complete rules for spirantization of oral stops
    (so-called <hi rend="italic">begadkephat</hi> letters) have been moved to
    Appendix A.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P7"/>[7] The
    presentation of the noun system in Coakley's revision is
    condensed and many details that Robinson included are omitted.
    For example, there is never any explicit explanation of the
    "construct state." Also, smaller details that made Robinson a
    unique resource this fifth edition leaves behind. For example,
    Robinson presented the peculiarities of the abstract feminine
    nouns with long vowels <hi rend="italic">-ī</hi> and <hi rend="italic">-ū</hi> in his
    presentation of the noun, as well as many footnotes with
    lexical and semantic details. Coakley omits most of these.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P8"/>[8]
    Terminologically, this revision maintains the same grammatical
    terminology Robinson shares with nearly all introductions to
    Syriac. Such terminology is a hindrance. Comparative Semitics
    has all but abandoned most of this terminology because it
    imposes categories on nouns and adjectives that have no
    functional explanatory correlation. For example, the "absolute
    state" of adjectives is functionally a simple predicate
    adjective. On the other hand, nouns in the absolute state
    function almost always as adverbs. Syriac nouns in the
    "absolute state" are historically adverbial accusatives, with
    parallels in other Aramaic dialects and Arabic. Predicate
    adjectives parallel the predicative construction, attested in
    Akkadian. Hence, the term "absolute state" for Syriac nouns and
    adjectives reflects neither their synchronic nor their
    diachronic grammar. Again, adjectives never agree with nouns in
    the "construct state." Only substantivized adjectives occur in
    this form, which is really the Semitic bound form of nominals.
    An update of these terms would have forced a better and more
    logical presentation of the grammar to students.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P9"/>[9] Coakley
    does make improvements to the section on irregular nouns
    (section 12). Instead of Robinson's original table, which was
    hard to read, Coakley spreads out the presentation over a few
    pages, and in many cases gives a brief historical explanation
    of irregular forms. It is well laid-out and informative.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P10"/>[10]
    Robinson's original sequence treated nouns, adjectives,
    prepositions and participles in sections three through thirteen
    before introducing any component of the verb. Coakley
    interrupts this sequence and introduces the
    "<hi rend="italic">pe<hi rend="sup">c</hi>al</hi> perfect" (G preterite) of sound verbs
    with a brief overview of the Syriac verb system (section eight,
    pp. 34-35). The overall presentation of the verb is little
    improved in the fifth edition. The terminology of the verb
    system is a relic that masks the basic semantics of the verb
    stems and makes learning Syriac more difficult. The terms
    Robinson used are those of the Hebrew grammarians. For example,
    the names of the Syriac verb stems are taken from the verb root
    <hi rend="italic">p<hi rend="sup">c</hi>l</hi> following the Hebrew grammatical
    tradition. This root is of very limited occurrence in Syriac
    (and is probably a fossil of Syriac translation of the Old
    Testament). The root consonants of this verb do not show the
    details of spirantization. The verb used as a paradigm for
    sound verbs is <hi rend="italic">qtl</hi> 'kill.' A better choice is <hi rend="italic">ktb</hi>
    'write' because all three consonants are susceptible to
    spirantizat ion. And writing is more excellent than killing, as
    the Syriac Fathers and Mothers might say.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P11"/>[11]
    Robinson's explanation of the semantics of Syriac verb
    morphology in terms of "Indo-European" (read: Greek and Latin)
    is erroneous. The terms "conjugation" and "tense" do not
    correspond well to Semitic grammatical categories. "Perfect"
    and "imperfect" are also relics from Hebrew grammar. These are
    not, as Robinson asserts, "tenses" in the Indo-European sense
    (p. 35). Semitic verb morphology encodes tense within the
    fundamental distinction of aspect. Even then, the fundamental
    tense category is "past" vs. "non-past," not "past" vs.
    "future" (p. 35).</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P12"/>[12] The
    lack of adequate discussion of the semantics of the verb system
    in the narrative structuring of Syriac prose is a deficiency.
    The verb forms in prose narrative comprise a system for
    encoding volition, necessity, and narrative features such as
    topic, background, direct and indirect discourse. These
    grammatical features are basic to interpreting Syriac texts
    properly. Leading a student through the basics of this
    subsystem of Syriac grammar would have been a great
    service.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P13"/>[13] In
    the vocabularies pertaining to each section, Coakley presents
    the vowels of the <hi rend="italic">pe<hi rend="sup">c</hi>al</hi> perfect. Once the
    <hi rend="italic">pe<hi rend="sup">c</hi>al</hi> imperfect is introduced, he includes
    the imperfect stem vowel with each verb in the vocabulary. The
    stem vowels of the G perfect and imperfect must be learned with
    each G verb stem, so this is a welcome improvement over
    Robinson. It would have been more helpful to provide a chart of
    the imperfect vowels for all verbs occurring in the
    vocabularies before the imperfect is introduced in section 13
    (p. 60).</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P14"/>[14] The
    vocabulary and exercises deserve some comments. First, Coakley
    kept the English-to-Syriac exercises alongside the
    Syriac-to-English. This is a strong point of Robinson's work.
    Coakley reduced the size of the exercises from an average of
    fifteen sentences in both Syriac and English exercises in
    Robinson to ten each. The Syriac and English exercises contain
    sentences that are identical to or close paraphrases of those
    found in the Peshitta and in patristic sources. These are not
    full texts, but are separate sentences and are more
    entertaining and relevant than those in Robinson.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P15"/>[15] Many
    of the exercises in the fifth edition are new but the coverage
    of the grammar is not better than in earlier versions. It is
    still a shortcoming of Robinson and most other introductions to
    Syriac that there are no "drills" of the grammar presented in
    each lesson. Robinson often presented vocabulary in the course
    of the grammar of the lesson but did not summarize those words
    with the rest of the vocabulary at the end of the lesson. This
    is one of the biggest complaints students raise about Robinson.
    Coakley has commendably eliminated this glaring problem,
    consistent with the "friendly introduction" promised in the
    preface.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P16"/>[16]
    Coakley includes four helpful appendices. Appendix A covers
    exceptions to the phonological rule that spirantizes oral stops
    in post-vocalic position and includes relevant orthographic
    rules. This is a holdover of material from earlier editions.
    Appendix B covers the Estrangçlâ writing system.
    This includes material on diacritic points used to distinguish
    orthographically identical forms in consonantal texts. Appendix
    C is an introduction to the East Syriac script and a helpful
    tabulation of the features of East Syriac pronunciation and
    orthographic conventions. Appendices B and C conclude with
    short passages in the respective script. Appendix D covers
    calendrical formulas. It takes material from Robinson,
    paragraph 24, that outlines date formulae and supplements it
    with the list of month names and correspondences in the Latin
    system. These appendices are clearly written and most helpful.
    Finally, a great improvement is Coakley's inclusion of an
    English-Syriac glossary.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P17"/>[17]
    There are still no Syriac textbooks providing students with a
    thorough and sound introduction to Syriac as a written idiom.
    Robinson's work lays out the basics of the morphology and a few
    notes about syntax, and Coakley corrects and streamlines his
    presentation. However, there is little here that is
    substantially different from most other English presentations
    of the language. In terms of grammatical analysis and
    description, there has been no substantial and systematic
    attempt to bring Syriac into the light of modern historical and
    comparative linguistics.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P18"/>[18] This
    is particularly true with respect to the semantics of syntax.
    Semitic languages encode narrative categories, such as topic,
    focus, main-line clause, background clause, and dialog using a
    remarkably different set of techniques than Western languages.
    Much of the difficulty in reading Syriac prose is that these
    techniques are very much a prominent part of any text. This
    component of syntax is nowhere covered in any introduction to
    Syriac of which I am aware. In comparison with the coverage of
    such grammatical points in many recent introductions to
    Biblical Hebrew, where the importance of syntax and narrative
    marking has been recognized in recent English textbooks, Syriac
    lags far behind.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P19"/>[19]
    Another problem is that introductions to Syriac neglect the
    Semitics student who would benefit from a better presentation
    of the comparative and historical grammar of Syriac. Coakley
    and Robinson did not intend to address those needs and are in
    perfect harmony on this issue with most other Syriac
    introductions. By comparison, Huehnergard's <hi rend="italic">A Grammar of
    Akkadian</hi> is an example of a successful presentation of the
    historical and synchronic grammar of a Semitic language. Such
    an introduction would be desirable for Aramaic as well.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P20"/>[20] All
    in all, Coakley's contribution to Robinson has made many good
    improvements on a text that should appeal to a wide range of
    students of Early Christian studies and Semitics students who
    want an accurate and fast overview of the grammar. The work
    will be most helpful as a quick reference for students who are
    beyond the first year.</p>

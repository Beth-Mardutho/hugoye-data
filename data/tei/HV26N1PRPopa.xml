<head>Andrew Palmer, transl., <hi rend="italic">The Life of the
                    Syrian Saint Barsauma: Eulogy of a Hero of the Resistance to the Council of
                    Chalcedon</hi>, Transformation of the Classical Heritage 61 (Oakland: University
                of California Press, 2020). Pp. 140; $85.00, paperback $24.95.</head>

            <div type="body" xml:lang="en">
            <p xml:lang="en">Barsauma was a controversial character who became pertinent to
                Syriac literature for his trenchant stance against Chalcedon. Barsauma is one of the
                few personalities whose life has permeated and affected many other Christian
                denominations and Eastern traditions such as Syriac, Arabic, Geʽez, and, likely,
                Armenian.</p>
            <p xml:lang="en">Historians focusing on the historiography of Eastern Christianity –
                and Syriac scholars in particular – have long awaited a complete translation of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Life of the Syriac Saint Barsauma</hi>, after several small
                sections of the work were translated by François Nau more than a hundred years ago.
                This wish has finally been fulfilled by Andrew Palmer who with this publication has
                done Syriac historiography a great service by offering an introduction to and
                translation of the <hi rend="italic">Life</hi>, thereby bringing to broader
                scholarly attention a figure who can now perhaps be more accurately assessed than
                has previously been possible.</p>
            <p xml:lang="en">A translation of the <hi rend="italic">Life of Barsauma</hi> has
                long been awaited by Syriac scholars, especially given that Barsauma himself, that
                entirely atypical monk, was so peculiarly depicted that his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Life</hi> could never have passed unnoticed; rather, it arouses broad interest
                and appeal through its antagonistic juxtapositions of a portrait of a saint but also
                of a sinner, featuring not only miraculous situations but also ambitions and
                resistance to all kinds of dangers or contexts, dominated by spiritual tension and a
                strong character.</p>
            <p xml:lang="en">Palmer’s translation published in this volume has also been included
                in a collection of essays published in the same series, edited by Johannes Hahn and
                Volker Menze,<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn2" n="1"><p rend="H BR Footnote">
                        <hi rend="italic">The Wandering Holy Man: The Life of Barsauma, Christian
                            Asceticism, and Religious Conflict in Late Antique Palestine</hi>,
                        Transformations of the Classical Heritage 60 (Oakland: University of
                        California Press, 2020).</p></note> which contains studies on the contextual
                and personal background of Barsauma and which represents a useful introductory tool
                for those who wish to study the life of this Syriac Orthodox figure.</p>
            <p xml:lang="en">Regarding the book under review, we can note that the format is
                quite appealing, beginning with the cover itself that from the very first glance
                seems to impart its mystery onto the reader, a mystery not unlike that of Barsauma’s
                life. The volume opens with an Introduction (pp. 1–8) in which the translator
                situates the character of Barsauma in the broader Syriac hagiographic context. The
                first issue Palmer mentions is Barsauma’s terrible image as it appears in Western
                sources, beginning with his mention in the <hi rend="italic">Bibliotheca
                    Orientalis</hi>. Palmer then introduces the reader to the manuscript tradition
                of Barsauma’s life (pp. 1–2), with reference not only to the British Library
                manuscript, Add MS 12,174, but also to the most complete manuscript and the basis
                for his translation: Damascus MS 12/17 of the Syriac Orthodox Patriarchal
                Library.</p>
            <p xml:lang="en">Before giving a brief overview of the major events in Barsauma’s
                life, the translator does not shy away from offering several hypotheses as to why
                Western Catholic scholars characterized Barsauma so negatively (in particular,
                Assemanus and Nau) (pp. 3–4). Palmer then switches registers and offers a summary of
                the important moments of Barsauma’s life (pp. 6–8) followed, for the reader’s
                orientation, by two maps of the geography of the 5th century, the character’s
                lifetime, and then by a tabular outline (pp. 11–18) of Barsauma’s biographical
                stages (two parts, containing in total 10 chapters). Here, Palmer provides several
                important pieces of information, most importantly that the original author of the
                biography did not provide section (chapter) titles. In this regard, Palmer goes on
                to highlight that various readers through the ages contributed to the structure of
                the volume we see today, because they were the ones “who numbered the pilgrimages,
                the distinctions, and the miracles in the margins, adding headings” which later
                scribes incorporated into the body of the text (p. 11).</p>
            <p xml:lang="en">Palmer’s translation is both dynamic and precise; the footnotes, 202
                in all, are fairly concise – as all translations should strive for – yet clear and
                well organized, so that the reader does not move from one page or section to the
                next with any remaining ambiguity or gaps about what is being described. The notes
                usually offer brief explanations of Syriac words, frequently presenting the literary
                meaning of certain expressions, pointing out biblical references, or clarifying
                certain place and personal names in the context of the character’s life. They also
                occasionally provide additional information, such as theological or contextual
                definitions and explanations, define technical ecclesiastical terms, or explain
                distances, directions, times or units of measurement, etc. In some notes the
                translator offers details or additional information about formal aspects of the
                manuscript, the omission of words or phrases, etc. The translator makes limited
                literature recommendations for certain themes or concepts within the <hi
                    rend="italic">Life</hi>, most likely both from the practical concern of not
                egregiously expanding the notes but attempting but also in light of the fact that
                the volume edited by Hahn and Menze already offers several studies on Barsauma that
                abound in references to specialist literature.</p>
            <p xml:lang="en">With what historical or hagiographical information will the reader
                be left after reading this translation? At the very least, with a knowledge of some
                aspects of the hagiographic colouring of Barsauma’s life, especially as related to
                his pilgrimages to the holy places in which he is portrayed as an ardent believer,
                manifesting a number of other extraordinary actions in an almost hyperbolic
                framework; indeed, some scholars have almost cast into doubt a number of the acts
                depicted as having transpired throughout these journeys. Barsauma’s first pilgrimage
                to the holy places would appear to have taken place around the year 400, when he was
                still a teenager. Roughly twenty years later, Barsauma travelled to Jerusalem for a
                second time; here, he is already presented as a leader, travelling “with 40 of his
                disciples” – most likely a symbolic number, as in the third pilgrimage we see him
                having embarked on the journey with one hundred companions in total. The hero’s
                journeys are dominated by his strong personality and accentuated by the dynamics of
                his actions, the hero travelling through countless regions and localities and
                leaving his polemical spiritual mark everywhere he went. Indeed, all actions
                depicted highlight the profile of the saint, who performs miracles, is involved in
                the manifestation of faith, and in the defence of his confession at any risk or
                cost. In his third and fourth pilgrimages we see the introduction of the character
                of Empress Eudocia, a Roman powermonger that offers him precious gifts which he,
                initially, rejects. Barsauma’s fourth pilgrimage seems to be dominated by the idea
                of transforming his character from a conventional Christian (if Barsauma could ever
                fall into such a category) into an ardent fighter for the identity of his Church
                tradition in Jerusalem against the imperial Byzantine edict authorizing the Jews to
                gather atop the Temple Mount in the Holy City.</p>
            <p xml:lang="en">Whosoever wants to learn more about this complex Syriac personality
                that transformed and dynamized everything around him, who monopolized space and time
                and reversed the normal course of religious reality, namely that atypical monk
                Barsauma – whose profile resembles a jigsaw puzzle that can be built from varied
                elements dominated by power structures, violence, monastic vocation, miracles,
                overzealousness for the faith and a spirit of devotion to his tradition – could
                hardly do better than read Palmer’s translation in its entirety, as it opens up a
                horizon of Christian hagiographic tension that is almost unique, and with which few
                texts of Late Antiquity can truthfully compete.</p>

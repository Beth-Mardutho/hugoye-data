    Symposium commemorating the 1300th anniversary of the passing
    away of Mor Jacob of Edessa, the prominent Syrian polymath was
    held in Aleppo, Syria, June 9�12th, 2008.</p>
         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P2"/>[2] The
    Participants who came from Austria, Canada, Germany,
    Netherlands, Turkey, United Kingdom and the United States as
    well as Lebanon and Syria enjoyed the papers presented at the
    Symposium, included contributions from scholars and specialists
    in Syriac studies. These contributions, which included twelve
    papers that were delivered in five sessions, discussed the
    writings of the celebrated scholar Mor Jacob of Edessa as a
    chronicler, man of letters, grammarian, exegete, theologian,
    and as a major contributor to church liturgy and canon law.</p>
         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P3"/>[3] The
    proceedings of the Symposium also included an opening session
    in which a welcoming address was delivered by Mor Gregorios
    Yohanna Ibrahim, Metropolitan of Aleppo and a keynote lecture
    by Sebastian Brock, as well as a final session.</p>
         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P4"/>[4] The
    Symposium programme included visits to a number of
    archaeological locations of Syrian monasteries that for
    centuries were beacons of knowledge. These included the
    Monastery of Tell�Ada, where Mor Jacob lived the last ten years
    of his celebrated life, and where he died and was buried on
    June 5th, 708; the Monastery of St. Simeon the Stylite, a major
    fifth century cathedral that was named after St. Simeon the
    Stylite, the founder of the Stylite Monastic practice; the
    recently uncovered Monastery of Qenneshrin, which was founded
    by Yohanna Bar Aphtonia in 538 and which remained active up to
    the thirteenth century; and the town of Mabug, the birth place
    of Theodora, the Syrian Queen, and the seat of Mor Philoxenus
    of Mabug (+ 523).</p>
         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P5"/>[5] In its
    final session, the Symposium resolved the following: The
    proceedings of the Symposium will be published in English by
    Gorgias Press and in Arabic by Mardin Publishing House. The
    full texts of the papers should be submitted to Gorgias Press
    by October 1st, 2008 and the Arabic translation of the texts to
    be completed by March 1st, 2009. Encouraged by the immense
    success of the Symposium and in order to promote continuity in
    the study of the Syriac literary heritage, and in recognition
    of Aleppo�s special place in this heritage, it was decided that
    a series of colloquia will be held, each under the title Aleppo
    Syriac Colloquium (A.S.C.), every two years. Each colloquium
    will be devoted to one theme or studying the works of one
    renowned historic Syriac Scholar. The subject of the colloquium
    will be defined one year in advance and expert scholars will be
    invited to participate. In this respect it was resolved to hold
    the next colloquium during the second half of June, 2010 in
    Aleppo and will address the work of the outstanding Syrian
    polymath Mor Gregorios Yohanna Abu al-Faraj Barhebraeus
    (+1286). The participants expressed their profound appreciation
    and thanks to the host of the Symposium, Mor Gregorios Yohanna
    Ibrahim, for his initiative in organizing the Symposium, for
    his tireless efforts which ensured its complete success, and
    for the generous hospitality. As a token of this appreciation,
    the participants presented the metropolitan with a book
    authored by George Kiraz that included on its initial pages
    hand written notes that expressed their appreciation. The
    participants also expressed their deep thanks to the
    secretariat of the Symposium, to the monks and deacons and
    members of the different working groups of the Aleppo Syrian
    Orthodox Archdiocese, particularly the board of trustees of St
    George Church in Hay Al-Syrian, which accommodated the venue of
    the Symposium.</p>

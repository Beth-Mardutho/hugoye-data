                <p xml:lang="en">This volume is the first one to be published in the long-expected series, <hi rend="italic">Origen’s
                Hexapla: A Critical Edition of the Extant Fragments</hi>, initiated at the Rich Seminar
                on the Hexapla held at Oxford in 1994. Based on his dissertation at the Southern
                Baptist Theological Seminary under Prof. Peter Gentry, who has been serving in the
                editorial committee of this Hexapla project, this volume is dedicated to replacing
                the edition of Frederick Field, who compiled the fragments of Origen’s Hexapla known
                to him in the mid-19th century, and also to complement the Hexaplaric readings
                included in the second critical apparatus of the Göttingen Septuaginta by Joseph
                Ziegler (which Meade abbreviates, not surprisingly, as “the <hi rend="italic">Edition</hi>”).</p>
            <p xml:lang="en">Meade opens his prolegomena with an explicit statement that “this edition does not
                provide a new collation of materials but rather a fresh presentation of former
                sources collected into one place.” By “former sources” he means, in addition to
                Field’s version and Ziegler’s apparatus as mentioned above, new witnesses to Job’s
                Hexaplaric text made available by Ursula and Dieter Hagedorn, as well as several
                other manuscripts (such as minuscules 161 and 555) that were not accessible to
                previous editors of Hexapla. For the Syro-Hexapla, one of the essential sources for
                reconstructing the Hexapla, Meade relies on the edition of Ceriani as did Field,
                while for the Armenian tradition he draws on the edition of Claude Cox.</p>
            <p xml:lang="en">This volume is not the first in the project: Nancy Therese Woods critically edited
                the first twenty-one chapter of Job in her 2009 at the Southern Baptist Theological
                Seminary, also under the supervision of Gentry. However, Meade’s is the first to be
                published in the series. Therefore, the apparatus format Meade adopts as well as
                adapts will be crucial for all potential users of this new Hexapla edition. For a
                critical edition, it is necessary to present in an understandable way how different
                sources are evaluated and pieced together: According to which principles is the
                apparatus organized? Where does one find the information for solving the enigmatic
                numbers or symbols the editor(s) decided to employ? How does each section of the
                apparatus relate to the others?</p>
            <p xml:lang="en">With regard to the numbering system of the manuscripts, Meade sticks to the
                <hi rend="italic">Verzeichnis</hi> of Rahlfs and thus with the <hi rend="italic">Göttingen Septuaginta</hi>, with which most
                biblical scholars are familiar. Abbreviations and sigla are largely carried over
                from Ziegler’s <hi rend="italic">Edition</hi>, except for sigla for the catena. Meade inherited the latter
                from the Hagedorns who devised a system different from that of Ziegler. Ziegler
                subdivided the cantena manuscripts he used into two groups: the main group,
                designated by the capital letter <hi rend="italic">C</hi>, and the subgroup, <hi rend="italic">c</hi>. In the Hagedorns’ system,
                the group <hi rend="italic">cI</hi> largely corresponds to Ziegler’s <hi rend="italic">C</hi> (with additional minuscules 395 and
                3006) while <hi rend="italic">cII</hi> corresponds to Zieler’s <hi rend="italic">c</hi> (with 512 in addition). The Hagedorns
                created another main group <hi rend="italic">C</hi> (not to be confused with Ziegler’s <hi rend="italic">C</hi>!) for their
                purposes. With these differences in mind, the new sigla system should not confuse
                those familiar with Ziegler and Rahlfs.</p>
            <p xml:lang="en">With respect to the layout of the new apparatus system, Meade very kindly offers
                three examples to demonstrate how it works (pp. 20-22): The first witness apparatus
                (<hi rend="italic">Wit 1</hi>) contains the primary Hexaplaric witnesses, the second apparatus (<hi rend="italic">Wit 2</hi>)
                lists witnesses outside “the Three” (Aquila, Symmachus, and Theodotion) that may
                betray influence from the Three. The third apparatus (<hi rend="italic">Attr</hi>) presents variants to the
                attribution, the fourth (<hi rend="italic">Var</hi>) shows variations within those witnesses mentioned in
                Wit 1, while the fifth (<hi rend="italic">NonGr</hi>) lists all available non-Greek sources.</p>
            <p xml:lang="en">For reconstructing the Hexapla, at least two types of information should be properly
                registered in a critical edition. One is the diacritical signs which Origen applies
                to his fifth column (designated in the following as Type I information), especially
                the <hi rend="italic">asterisks</hi>: As it is generally supposed, when verses are missing in the
                Septuagint in comparison to the Hebrew text, Origen adopted readings from Theodotion
                and marked the borrowing with <hi rend="italic">asterisks</hi> (and <hi rend="italic">metobelis</hi>) to make his fifth column
                more isomorphic to the Hebrew text. In the case of Job, asterisked verses are in a
                relatively large quantity: one-sixth of the Göttingen LXX of Job, according to
                Gentry, or 600 to 700 <hi rend="italic">stichoi</hi>, according to Jerome, are asterisked. The second type
                of information registered concerns base texts, including the texts of different
                Septuagint versions and the Three (Type II). </p>
            <p xml:lang="en">These two types of information are two dimensions that quite often cross over into
                each other: For instance, according to the base text of the Syro-Hexapla, the verses
                Job 22:13-16 are under the asterisks (Type I), while according to the marginal notes
                on the same page, readings of Symmachus are provided for verse 14b as well as for
                verse 15 (Type II). Meade (as well as Woods) decided to present both types of
                critical notes in an undifferentiated way by keeping strictly to the five-section
                apparatus system, first presenting Type I information and then Type II that might
                relate to the same verses. In this seemingly redundant but sophisticated manner,
                both types of critical information are well organized and presented parallel to each
                other. The three examples Meade gives in his introduction are a great demonstration
                of the power of this system: the first two examples belong to Type II, and the third
                one belongs to Type I, yet they all follow the same format. It might be beneficial
                to make a more explicit statement about the difference there-between to avoid
                confusion for the readers. </p>
            <p xml:lang="en">Following are three general methodological reflections upon the volume. The first
                reflection concerns the first witness apparatus (<hi rend="italic">Wit 1</hi>). This apparatus is for
                variants from “the Three” of the Hexapla. However, by definition, “the Three” are
                not necessarily Hexaplaric. As Woods raised the question in her prologue, “can we be
                sure that attributions are truly ‘Hexaplaric’ or are they attributions added or
                circulated outside of Origen’s Hexapla,” since, “‘the Three’ have also a history of
                their own, outside of Origen’s Hexapla” (p. 8)? In other words, it is sometimes
                only taken by default that, if there is any attribution to the Three from a specific
                manuscript, this attributed citation, and the attribution as well, must descend from
                the Hexapla itself. Yet, theoretically, we can never exclude the possibility that a
                specific fragmentary citation could be ascribed to some scribe or translator rather
                than to Origen himself. For those readers that only interested in how the original
                Aquila, Symmachus, and Theodotion read, it might be unimportant whether a reading
                attributed to the Three stands inside or outside the Hexaplaric tradition; however,
                for those who are interested in how the original Hexapla looked like, the nuance
                between the theoretical definition of “Hexaplaric” as confined to the very
                production of Origen, and the practical identification of almost any witnesses of
                the Three with “Hexaplaric” is worth being mentioned. </p>
            <p xml:lang="en">The second reflection concerns the second witness apparatus (<hi rend="italic">Wit 2</hi>), which records
                readings that “have been corrupted by Hexaplaric readings.” These readings are
                primarily taken from Ziegler’s first apparatus. I highly appreciate the effort Meade
                makes to keep all relevant readings for the convenience of the readers; however, it
                is often subjective to determine whether a variant stands under the influence of the
                Hexapla. For instance, in Job 24:22b, where Meade records υπερ <hi rend="italic">L</hi> [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] (Lucianic
                recension main group) as against <foreign xml:lang="gr">κατά</foreign> of the Old Greek text in the apparatus in
                question, it is far from certain that υπερ is inspired by <foreign xml:lang="gr">περί</foreign> in Symmachus. It is
                quite a strenuous effort to build causal relationships among the already very
                fragmentary witnesses if practically too many possible candidates are missing.</p>
            <p xml:lang="en">The final reflection concerns the last apparatus (NonGr) in the case of asterisked
                verses (Type I): In these cases, Meade kindly provides all translations available
                (e.g., Syrohexapla, Latin version of Jerome, and Armenian for Job 22:13-16), which
                occupies much space. However, as noted above, Type I variants are not variants of a
                biblical base text but variants of Origen’s diacritical signs. For this purpose, it
                seems unnecessary to provide concrete texts of all available translations. A simple
                note in the fourth apparatus signifying the status of the signs, like in the case of
                Greek manuscripts, should suffice for the purpose.</p>
            <p xml:lang="en">While producing this critical edition, Meade also undertook highly relevant research
                on individual manuscripts, which is not to be taken for granted. For instance, he
                confirmed that the minuscule 476 is a descendant of 139 (p. 16), and further
                determined that the minuscule 788, which had been ignored by Field, Ziegler, and the
                Hagedorns, is the ancestor of 250. This latter discovery is quite crucial for the
                purpose of this edition since 250 is the major witness to the Hagedorns’ <foreign xml:lang="gr">α</foreign>-catena
                group (the <hi rend="italic">C</hi> group). These insights lead to a slight but significant modification of
                the Hagedorns’ catena system, which itself differs from Ziegler’s, as presented
                above. Especially valuable for scholars interested in the Syro-Hexapla is Meade’s
                research on Syro-Hexaplaric Job published 2016, which analyzed several essential
                aspects of the marginalia of the Codex Ambrosianus. </p>
            <p xml:lang="en">With his solid research, accompanied by the well-designed system for registering the
                critical notes, Meade has produced a marvelous milestone for the new Hexapla
                Project. There are sporadic errors spread in this volume, which might impede the
                understanding for a moment: e.g., on page 33, the down arrow for manuscript 248
                leads us to expect more information down below while non-existent; or in Job 24:22b,
                “+ <foreign xml:lang="gr">τῆς ἑαυτοῦ ζωῆς</foreign>” is provided for the marginal note of the Syro-Hexapla in
                comparison to the lemma in question, περί (or <foreign xml:lang="syr">ܥܠ</foreign> in the case of the Syro-Hexapla ),
                while the marginal note of the Syro-Hexapla does not need a “harmonization with the
                bible text of the LXX” to produce the whole prepositional phrase, but the note is
                addressed to the whole phrase <foreign xml:lang="syr">ܥܠ ܚ̈ܝܐ ܕܝܠܗ</foreign> in an understandably redundant way.
                These minor deficits can be easily fixed once detected. Overall, Meade’s volume has
                successfully provided proof of the practicability of the format employed by the
                critical project and has thus laid a robust foundation for all future volumes of
                <hi rend="italic">Origen’s Hexapla: A Critical Edition of the Extant Fragments</hi>, of which we are
                excited to see the publication in the next years. He deserves the congratulations
                and profound thanks of all scholars working on Origen, biblical textual criticism
                and the Syro-Hexapla. </p>

            <anchor corresp="P1"/>[1] The
    Brunei Lecture Theatre at the School of Oriental and African
    Studies (SOAS) in London was the venue for the <hi rend="italic">Christianity
    in Iraq</hi> Seminar Day that was held on Saturday
    3<hi rend="sup">rd</hi> April, 2004.  The principal aim was to
    promote the rich Christian heritage of Iraq, by investigating
    not only the history and archaeology of the various Churches,
    but also the modern situation of the communities.  The day
    was held under the aegis of the Dept. for the Study of
    Religions, SOAS where Dr. Erica C.D. Hunter is Visiting
    Lecturer and Research Associate in Eastern Christianity.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P2"/>[2] Sir
    Terence Walker, British Ambassador to Baghdad between
    1981-1990, opened the morning session that explored historical
    and archaeological aspects.  Prof. John Healey (University
    of Manchester), <hi rend="italic">The early history of the Church of the
    East, and its mission in the Gulf</hi> discussed the
    activities of the Church of the East and its various
    settlements along the Gulf. Southern Iraq was the focus of the
    talk by Dr. Erica C.D. Hunter (University of Cambridge and
    SOAS), <hi rend="italic">The Christian communities of Hira and southern 
    Iraq</hi> which drew attention to the monasteries of Hira and
    the overall presence of the Church of the East  in the
    regions around Kerbala and Najaf.  Moving north, Prof.
    Amir Harrak (University of Toronto), <hi rend="italic">The Christian
    archaeology of Tekrit,</hi> showed slides of Syriac
    inscriptions that came to light during the excavations in the
    1990's  which were conducted by the Dept. of Antiquities
    at Tekrit. Dr. Heleen Murre Van Den Berg (University of Leiden)
    <hi rend="italic">Formulating Christian identities in the Ottoman
    period</hi> highlighted the development of Syriac
    consciousness and nationalism that emerged in the late
    eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P3"/>[3] The
    afternoon session, under the chair of Dr. Erica C.D. Hunter,
    focused on modern Iraq, with clergy of  the Syriac
    Churches profiling the current situations of their communities
    after a brief introduction by Dr. Suha Rassam. The Rev.
    Khoshaba Georges represented the Assyrian Church, The Rev.
    Habib Al-Nawfali represented the Chaldaean Church, The Rev.
    Toma Daood represented the Syrian Orthodox Church and The Rev.
    Safa' Habash representing the Syrian Catholic Church.  All
    clergy imparted much valuable information about their
    communities which showed that, despite the great difficulties
    of the last year, a great reservoir of hope and also the
    longstanding working relations with the Muslim
    communities. This point also emerged during questions from
    the audience to the clergy. In fact, the major perceived threat
    was from Born Again Christian evangelists whose
    activities  undermine the communities and their relations
    with Muslims. The day closed with a talk on <hi rend="italic">The Christian
    Neo-Aramaic Dialects of Iraq</hi> by Prof. Geoffrey Khan, FBA
    (University of Cambridge) whose project to map the Neo-Syriac
    dialects has now received major funding. </p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P4"/>[4] The
    Seminar Day concluded with a speech by Sir Harald Walker, the
    last representative of the British government in Baghdad before
    the 1990 Gulf War. The interest generated by the Seminar Day,
    which was attended by more than one hundred people, including
    representatives of the Foreign Office and media persons, was
    most gratifying.  Donations by <hi rend="italic">The British School of
    Archaeology in Iraq</hi> and <hi rend="italic">The Anglican and Eastern
    Churches Association</hi> helped to defray costs and made this
    day possible.  Such was the success that another Seminar
    Day, focusing on the international dynamics of Christianity in
    Iraq is being planned for May 2005.</p>

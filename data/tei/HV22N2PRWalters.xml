                <p xml:lang="en">The field of Syriac studies, including language, history, religion,
                    and literature, has become much more visible in recent years, both as a distinct
                    area of study and as a significant ancillary subject to other fields (Early
                    Christianity, Late Antiquity, Islamic studies, Middle Eastern History, etc.).
                    One area where the visibility of Syriac studies was lacking, however, was the
                    publication of scholarly reference handbooks. The present volume, edited by
                    Daniel King, fills this gap and provides a much-needed reference work for anyone
                    interested in Syriac, novice and expert alike.</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">The book is arranged in five parts.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn1"
                        n="1">
                        <p rend="footnote text">For purposes of space, it is impossible to review
                            each chapter individually, so the comments here will treat each part of
                            the work, focusing on thematic connections. Likewise, for purposes of
                            space I will not include the titles of chapters. I will merely refer to
                            chapter numbers and the authors’ names. The full Table of Contents is
                            available on the publisher’s website:

                    </note> Part I (“Backgrounds”) situates the study of early Syriac literature and
                    history against two historical backdrops: the eastern Roman Empire in Late
                    Antiquity (Ch. 1, Muriel Debié) and the Sasanian Empire (Ch. 2, Touraj Daryaee).
                    In addition to the wealth of information provided in these chapters, they also
                    introduce a theme that runs throughout the work: the relationship of Syriac
                    speakers to imperial powers. The study of Syriac history and literature from
                    virtually any time period involves an understanding of the political precarity
                    of these communities, which shaped significant aspects of the development of
                    ecclesiastical hierarchies and divisions between communities.<note place="foot"

                            significance of the history of empires and issues pertaining to
                            political alignments, see especially: Ch. 6 (Volker Menze), Ch. 7
                            (Dietmar W. Winkler), Ch. 8 (Geoffrey Herman), Ch. 10 (Nathanael

                    </note></p>
                <p xml:lang="en">Part II (“The Syriac World in Late Antiquity”) continues the
                    historical framing, but the chapters here are more varied in topic and scope.
                    Two chapters continue the theme of Part I by addressing how Syriac Christians
                    adapted to Roman (Ch. 10, Nathanael Andrade) and Persian (Ch. 8, Geoffrey
                    Herman) settings. Some of the chapters herein treat the topic of Syriac
                    Christians and their relationship to other religious groups, including
                    pre-Christian “pagan” religions (Ch. 3, John F. Healey), Judaism (Ch. 9, Michal
                    Bar-Asher Siegal), and early Islam (Ch. 11, Michael Penn). Other chapters focus
                    particularly on the early history of the various branches of Syriac-speaking
                    churches (Ch. 6, Volker Menze; Ch. 7, Dietmar W. Winkler; and Ch. 12, David
                    Wilmshurst). Rounding out the section are chapters that debunk literary myths
                    about the origins of Syriac Christianity (Ch. 4, David G. K. Taylor) and an
                    overview of Syriac monasticism (Ch. 5, Florence Jullien). The topics of these
                    chapters are diverse and difficult to classify together, but they are likely to
                    be of intertest to a wide variety of readers as they interact with a number of
                    other fields.</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">Part III (“The Syriac Language”), containing four chapters,
                    provides a more coherent thematic organization by focusing solely on topics
                    pertaining to Syriac as a language. The first two chapters in this section (Ch.
                    13, Holger Gzella and Ch. 14, Aaron Michael Butts) both situate Syriac
                    linguistically with respect to other Semitic languages; the former is broader in
                    scope, while the latter focuses more on developments within and unique features
                    of classical Syriac. The following contribution (Ch. 15, Françoise
                    Briquel-Chatonnet) treats the history of writing systems for Syriac, including
                    an analysis of both inscriptions and manuscripts. The section concludes with an
                    essay on Neo-Aramaic dialects and their relationship to early forms of
                    Syriac/Aramaic (Ch. 16, Geoffrey Khan).</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">Part IV (“Syriac Literary, Artistic, and Material Culture in Late
                    Antiquity”), in contrast with the thematic unity of the previous section, is a
                    wide-ranging collection of essays on various topics. Several of the chapters are
                    focused on divergent aspects of Syriac literature, such as the Bible (Ch. 17,
                    Jonathan Loopstra), an overview of early Syriac literature (Ch. 18, Ute
                    Possekel), poetic writings (Ch. 19, Sebastian Brock), hagiography (Ch. 20,
                    Jeanne-Nicole Mellon Saint-Laurent), and historiography (Ch. 24, Philip Wood).
                    Two further chapters pertaining to literature explore the contributions of
                    Syriac to the preservation and development of philosophical (Ch. 25, John W.
                    Watt) and medical knowledge (Ch. 26, Grigory Kessel). Other thematic chapters
                    treat topics such as mysticism (Ch. 21, Adrian Pirtea), theological debates (Ch.
                    22, Theresia Hainthaler), women and children (Ch. 29, Susan Ashbrook Harvey),
                    and agriculture (Ch. 30, Michael J. Decker). Finally, material culture is
                    treated in two chapters, focusing on wall paintings (Ch. 27, Emma Loosley) and
                    church architecture (Ch. 28, Widad Khoury). In addition to these chapters, it
                    would have been nice if a chapter on Syriac manuscripts as objects of material
                    culture had been included.</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">The final section, Part V (“Syriac Christianity Beyond the Ancient
                    World”) explores different aspects of Syriac history and culture beyond its
                    ancient contexts. Several chapters are geographically oriented, surveying the
                    history of Syriac Christianity in Central Asia (Ch. 31, Mark Dickens), China
                    (Ch. 32, Hidemi Takahashi), India (Ch. 33, István Perczel), and later
                    developments in the Middle East (Ch. 35, Thomas Carlson). The remaining chapters
                    are difficult to classify, treating topics as diverse as the medieval
                    renaissance of Syriac literature (Ch. 34, Dorothea Weltecke and Helen
                    Younansardaroud), the Maronite tradition (Ch. 36, Shafiq Abouzayd), the early
                    study of Syriac in Europe (Ch. 37, Robert J. Wilkinson), modern Syriac identity
                    (Ch. 38, Heleen Murre-van den Berg), and even the most recent political
                    upheavals affecting Syriac Christians in Iraq (Ch. 39, Erica C. D. Hunter). The
                    chapters in this section cover topics that have received comparatively less
                    scholarly attention than the earlier eras of Syriac literature and history, so
                    they play a much-needed role in introducing Syriac as a significant field of
                    study beyond Late Antiquity.</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">These chapters are supplemented by a set of newly produced maps,
                    arranged diachronically, which were produced by David A. Michelson, as well as a
                    series of three appendices: 1) a list of patriarchs of the Church of the East;
                    2) a list of patriarchs and maphrians for the West Syriac tradition, and 3) an
                    annotated bibliography of online resources for Syriac studies. The volume also
                    includes dozens of wonderful images and figures that enrich the various
                    essays.</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">In short, alongside the <hi rend="italic">Gorgias Encyclopedic
                        Dictionary of the Syriac Heritage</hi>, the present volume will immediately
                    become a standard reference work for nearly any topic in the broad field of
                    Syriac studies. The chapters contained in this volume are sufficiently broad to
                    serve as introductions for non-specialists, yet deep enough for experts to gain
                    further insight on a wide variety of topics. This volume is a ground-breaking
                    achievement, and the editor and all contributors should be commended for
                    producing such a valuable contribution to the field of Syriac Studies. Hopefully
                    this publication will make Syriac more visible as a field of study and serve as
                    an invitation to study the rich history and literature of the Syriac
                    tradition.</p>

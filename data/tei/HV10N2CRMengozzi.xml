    delle Accademie of the Ambrosiana Library in Milan, Italy, is
    the traditional venue for the yearly Meeting on Syriac
    Christianity, co-organized by the Servizio per
    l’Ecumenismo e il Dialogo (Office for Ecumenism and
    Interreligious Dialogue, directed by Monsignor Gianfranco
    Bottoni, Archbishopric of Milan), the Ambrosiana Library and
    SYRIACA (Italian Society of Syriac Scholars, chaired by Prof.
    Paolo Bettiolo, University of Padova). Since the beginning of
    the series in 2002, themes proceed in approximately
    chronological order and alternately focus on the Western and
    Eastern tradition of Syriac Christianity. Italian scholars,
    international guests and authorities of the Syrian churches are
    invited to contribute. The Syriac manuscript treasures kept in
    the Ambrosiana as well as the history of Syriac studies in
    Milan are regularly dealt with in the morning sessions of the
    Meeting.</p>

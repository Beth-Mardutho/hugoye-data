        <body>
            
            <div xml:id="hv24n2king.0" xml:lang="en">
            <p xml:lang="en">The history of textual criticism is full of sometimes
                surprisingly tortured debates over matters both of principle and of detail. Since
                textual criticism aims at a point closer to pure science than does most research in
                the humanities, opposing notions of what is the “right” analysis and what the
                “wrong” may from time to time achieve a certain pointedness that other, greyer,
                areas of research do not. Even textual criticism is not a pure science; an element
                of creative judgement is <hi rend="italic">sine qua non</hi> in the application of
                its principles, yet its principles are based on sound logic, and false applications
                of them can feasibly be detected and unmasked.</p>
            <p xml:lang="en">As early modern readers of Horace discovered to their cost, to reconstruct an
                autograph out of a tradition that is already corrupt at its outset, is at the very
                least an exercise in searching out tracks in a wilderness. The oasis is there
                somewhere, but the tracks have been so far obscured by the sands as to be
                discoverable only by the most tortuous methods. Those methods, however, are not
                unknown–they are the basis of the criticism of textual traditions and the descent of
                manuscript readings, and so the trackless waste is not a hopeless place. Good
                principles must be followed, and the evidence permitted to draw us where it will.
                Moreover, most textual critics are a good deal terser in expression than is the norm
                in the meandering ways of the more discursive branches of humanities. All the data
                is presented; but the reader must be willing to expend the effort to interpret it
                aright.</p>
            <p xml:lang="en">Some Syriac texts, especially the more technical philos-ophical translations from
                Greek originals, are so muddled that it is hard for the reader to judge whether an
                obviously faulty text should be ascribed to the incomprehension of an over-ambitious
                translator, the forgivable mis-readings of a confused scribe, or even the
                well-meaning but quite hopeless attempts at “correction” by the next tradent in the
                succession. In any case, the modern editor will be faced with some fundamental
                questions to which (s)he must offer some semblance of an answer, in order to produce
                something serviceable for future students. The only other option is simply to
                reproduce manuscripts, add a few remarks, and let readers make of the corrupt text
                what they will.</p>
            <p style="text-align: center;">*</p>
            <p xml:lang="en">I am wholeheartedly thankful to Yury Arzhanov for the comments and observations that
                he offers in the article preceding the present. To tell the truth, it is only when
                editing a text for publication that one comes squarely face-to-face with its
                problems and failings, and at this point the editor cannot avoid proposing solutions
                to these problems unless (s)he would prefer to go and do something else instead.
                This is why Arzhanov is especially well-suited to writing the article in question,
                since it arises not merely from his own reading of my edition of Aristotle’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Categories</hi>, but out of preparations for his own digital
                edition. The issues that he raises emerged quite naturally and organically from his
                task, and for this reason they are to be welcomed. Through such a dialectical
                process, we may all progress.</p>
            <p xml:lang="en">It must be stated clearly, however, that Arzhanov’s approach and aim as a textual
                critic are quite different to my own. He entered upon the business of producing a
                diplomatic edition of a corrupt ms, I of offering a critical edition. The former may
                be used with profit by those sifting through the textual traditions of the Syriac
                and Arabic versions, and by those who have the ability silently on their own to
                correct the many and egregious corruptions in the text; the latter, however, may be
                used by those who rely on an editor to make reasonable judgments about what the
                author actually wrote. The diplomatic text is, in my view, a defunct goal in today’s
                world of digitised and easily-available manuscripts; the critical reconstruction of
                a corrupt tradition, by contrast, is the only goal that can offer wider benefits in
                allied fields of research.</p>
            <p xml:lang="en">We are dealing then with a fundamental difference of principle. Arzhanov
                unfortunately often mistakes what are in fact matters of principle for mere issues
                of detail. He sincerely believes that he is critiquing some matter of detail because
                he has misconstrued the nature of that fundamental difference of principle that I am
                talking about. His article contains a number of fruitful corrigenda to my own
                edition, which I gladly receive and approve. But he too often appears to think that
                these testify to a failure of principle, or to confusion between different goals,
                whereas in reality the confusion is on his side of affairs. I shall lay out the
                evidence for this in the rest of this article, which thus presupposes at all points
                a close awareness of the issues raised by Arzhanov, and can only be read in close
                concert with his essay.</p>
            </div>
            <div xml:id="hv24n2king.1" xml:lang="en">
                <head>1. Gutas on the Principles of Textual Criticism</head>
                <p xml:lang="syr">Let us begin with Arzhanov’s summary of Gutas’s
                    “principles”–they may not seem especially momentous comments, but their
                    significance will become apparent. Arzhanov somewhat misrepresents the
                    complexity of Gutas’s system. What Gutas says<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn1"
                        n="1"><p rend="footnote text"> D. Gutas, <hi rend="italic">Theophrastus On
                                First Principles (Known as his Metaphysics)</hi>, Brill, Leiden
                            &amp; Boston 2010 (Philosophia Antiqua, 119), p.99.</p></note> is that
                    “non vert Ar” indicates that the editor is sure that the word(s) were present in
                    the Vorlage and were for some reason not translated; whereas “om Ar” is neutral,
                    it indicates only word(s) that are not present in Ar–in these cases the editor
                    does not pretend to know the reason. Hence “om Ar” is a neutral description of a
                    collation of one text against another. I do not pretend nearly as much as Gutas
                    to guess the intent of the translator but, in any case, “om A” in my edition is
                    a similarly neutral expression, indicating that a word is missing in the ms by
                    comparison with the printed page. This is also how it is used quite normally in
                    classical text editions. Whenever in a very corrupt tradition an editor needs to
                    make many conjectural emendations of this type, then naturally many “om” items
                    will appear in the apparatus. This fact does not prejudge how those errors
                    arose. </p>
                <p xml:lang="en">Arzhanov appears on more than one occasion to want rather more from the editor
                    than I am willing to commit myself to. He always seeks clarity about the <hi
                        rend="italic">cause</hi> or
                    <hi rend="italic">source </hi>of a particular textual error
                    or corruption, whether it be attributable to an otherwise unknown Greek variant,
                    or to a translation error, or to a scribal error within the Syriac transmission.
                    For him, it appears to be a failing of the edition not to commit itself to an
                    explanation.</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">Yet the simple answer is that, in the vast majority of cases, the precise cause
                    of corruption is unknowable. The edition lays out the data; editors may offer an
                    hypothesis as to the precise cause of corruption only when they are reasonably
                    certain; otherwise they limit themselves to the presentation of the data. That
                    is what I have done. To have done otherwise would be to go beyond the data. Of
                    course, future students with greater acuity than I will take this data and
                    themselves suggest possible causes of variants.</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">In this connection, two points must be carefully noted and emphasised:</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">1) that I only make emendations on the basis of <hi rend="italic">extant</hi>
                    Greek readings <hi rend="italic">known</hi> from Greek mss [i.e. I do not
                    imagine a Vorlage that is otherwise not extant]. This is a crucial principle.
                    Just as Gutas pointed out, having a good knowledge of the Greek tradition
                    <hi rend="italic">does </hi>help in the recon-struction of
                    the original text of the Syriac translation, because it offers variants which
                    sometimes allow us to gain insights into the mechanism of error within the
                    Syriac tradition. Speculating that unknown Greek var-iants might once have
                    existed as a means of explaining errors in the tradition that are more easily
                    explained in other ways is fruitless. Examples are offered below.</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">2) that emendations to the text were made only in cases where I believed it was
                    clear and obvious what the translator had written, and where the mechanism of
                    corruption can be plausibly reconstructed. The fact that we have only a single
                    ms witness to this text does not alter this principle.</p>

                <head>2. Two Difficult Points</head>
                <div xml:id="hv24n2king.2.1" xml:lang="en">
                    <head>i) The A/A* sigla</head>
                    <p xml:lang="syr">This section of Arzhanov’s article announces its own
                        superfluity from the outset, for he writes: “…these two points may
                        poten-tially lead the reader of the book to confusion.” I suppose they may
                        do so in the case of a reader prone to confusion of principles. But for the
                        reader who is not easily confused, they will not. And I take it that a
                        reader who has reached p.257 is probably not to be easily confused.</p>
                    <p xml:lang="en">But, briefly, for the benefit of the confused: in the general commentary
                        (pp.170-256) there is no need in principle to distinguish A from A* since
                        the commentary presupposes the reconstructed form of the text, which can
                        simply be labelled A. This is what is supposed (by a degree of subjective
                        editorial emendation) to have come off the translator’s desk. In the textual
                        notes (p.257-282), A* needs to be used as an additional siglum to indicate
                        the evident differences between the reconstructed autograph (A) and the
                        readings of the ms (A*). </p>
                    <p xml:lang="en">To take briefly one of examples Arzhanov offers (p.498): </p>
                    <cit><quote>on p. 212 we read: “6b36-7 [80vb] A omits any
                        equi-valent for δόξει.” Since A remains undifferentiated on these pages, it
                        is unclear whether the commentary refers to the state of the manuscript
                        (i.e. A*) or to that of the translator’s copy (i.e. A).</quote></cit>
                    <p xml:lang="en">It is hard to conceive what could be unclear to him. “A” means only what it
                        always means, viz. the reconstructed text of Anon as printed in the book.
                        When I state that A omits any equivalent for δόξει, it means just that, that
                        there is no equivalent in the edited text. I do not pretend to know the
                        reason–hence there could be no A/A* distinction here. Because 1) the ms text
                        makes sense as it is, and because 2) I can see no obvious mechanism of
                        scribal corruption, there is no call for any conjectural emendation. A
                        glance at the apparatus will make this much clear. My commentary is a
                        commentary on the edited text and requires the reader to have the text open.
                        Of course, a critic is most welcome to disagree with the editor’s judgement,
                        but to say that “it leads to confusion in the analysis of stage 3” [to use
                        Gutas’s terminology] will not be true for any reader who follows the
                        required logic. The principles here in question are sound and in no way
                        confusing. What I am thankful for is Arzhanov’s discovery of the occasional
                        error–e.g. that the comment on p.178 relating to 1b8 ought to have been
                        placed in the textual notes and not in the commentary.</p>
                    <p xml:lang="en">It is clear enough that much of this arises rather from Arzhanov’s personal
                        preference for the “security” of a diplomatic edition than from any failure
                        of principle on the part of my critical edition. The term “om[ittit]” has
                        throughout a purely functional role. A critical text prints the editor’s
                        reconstruction. The apparatus offers the wording of the ms collated against
                        it, hence, e.g., when “horse” must have been part of the translator’s
                        autograph (1b5), the apparatus must read “om.” since the ms does not read
                        “horse.” Arzhanov’s edition reads &lt;<foreign xml:lang="syr">ܣܘܣܝܐ</foreign>&gt;,
                        because that is what a diplomatic edition does. But this approach offers no
                        benefit over and above just digitising the manuscript, since the emendation
                        is clear and obvious.</p>

                    <head>ii) The relation of Anon to J and G</head>
                    <p xml:lang="en">On p.497, Arzhanov asserts that I established a
                        dependency relation between the three versions. Dependency is a rather
                        slippery term and is not, in fact, one that I used. I described J and G as
                        “revisions” of Anon. On p.80 I provide evidence for this, especially some
                        interesting translational errors which J and G both took from Anon in the
                        early passages of the text and corrected further on. Of course, there is no
                        question that J and G are in many ways very different from Anon. Moreover,
                        it is abundantly clear that they both used Greek copies of
                        <hi rend="italic">Categories </hi>different from that
                        which provided Anon with his Vorlage (not being an edition of J or G, this
                        book does not exhaustively treat the question of the Greek variants
                        represented in them), and it is equally clear that they used many quite
                        different expressions and translation equivalents. At the same time, I
                        believe it well-established that they knew Anon and made use of it. This
                        permits us to use the expression “revisions” but not “dependency” – it is
                        not clear to me quite what the latter term would entail in Arzhanov’s
                        schema.</p>
                    <p xml:lang="en">What is of far greater moment, however, is that this relationship–whatever
                        one calls it–does not in the slightest degree imply that J and G have
                        become, for the editor, “additional witnesses to the textual tradition
                        represented by Anon that help us to reconstruct the ‘translator’s autograph’
                        deriving from it” (p.497). How could they possibly have any such role? It
                        would as absurd as using an incunabulum of Catullus to reconstruct the
                        archetype of the Verona manuscript. J and G have significance only insofar
                        as they reveal to us the lines of the reception of Aristotle in the
                        seventh/eighth century. They in no way contribute to the reconstruction of
                        Anon’s autograph. They do not have that role in my edition; nor, I think, in
                        his.</p>
                    <p xml:lang="en">Arzhanov’s unnecessarily long foray into J and G and their specific
                        characteristics concludes limply: “What a reader of the book finds is a
                        combination of the analysis of Anon with that of J and G, which makes an <hi
                            rend="italic">impression</hi>…that J and G are mere witnesses of the
                        Syriac text of Anon” (p.501, my italics). It is singularly unfortunate that
                        Arzhanov falls under such a false impression. In truth, neither J nor G are
                        anywhere used in any way to assist in the reconstruction of Anon, nor are
                        they used as a source of “good variants.” To have used them in such a way,
                        even a little, would have been a manifest transgression of principle, and I
                        never entertained it for a moment.</p>
                    <p xml:lang="en">Arzhanov’s own analysis of the nature of the relationship between Anon and JG
                        is reasonably accurate, and is more-or-less in line with my own conclusions;
                        the actual (non-)role of JG in my own efforts to reconstruct the text of
                        Anon is, on the contrary, abundantly clear. Just how my edition “does not
                        allow the reader to distinguish between their witnesses, both in the
                        analysis of A/A* and in reconstructing the Greek text behind it” (p.502)
                        will remain a mystery to any reader willing to follow the logic of the case.
                        The use of sigla allows the reader to make precisely those distinctions
                        between witnesses that Arzhanov seems to find so difficult. He can offer no
                        single example where my reading of JG has affected my conjectural
                        emendations of the text of Anon. All that is left is his misplaced
                        “impression.”</p>
                    <p xml:lang="en">It would be wholly otiose even to embark upon a defence of my using the
                        Bekker referencing system for a text of Aristotle (p.502) – to have done
                        otherwise would have been pretentious and unnecessary. In the same
                        paragraph, he proffers the extraordinary suggestion that “the
                        commentary…creates a number of difficulties for readers who do not have the
                        Greek text of the <hi rend="italic">Categories</hi> in front of them.”
                        Indeed I would be shocked if a reader of the commentary <hi rend="italic"
                            >without</hi> the Greek text in front of them did not encounter very
                        many difficulties! Is a reader of a commentary expected now
                        <hi rend="italic">not </hi>to have access to the text

                <p xml:lang="syr">In this section, Arzhanov suggests that the “edition
                    does not always provide sufficient information on ‘what is known’” (p.503).
                    However, this criticism is otiose–the emendations concerned are minor matters
                    such as punctuation and syame points – it is quite normal in Syriac editions not
                    to note in the apparatus these minor editorial interventions. </p>
                <p xml:lang="en">He further suggests the improvement of using “angle brackets &lt;…&gt; that would
                    denote additions made to the text of the manuscript” (p.504). In fact, such a
                    method would be misleading. Angle brackets usually indicate the filling up of an
                    actual lacuna in the ms (e.g. words that are hard to read or where there is an
                    illegible part of the page). On the other hand, angle brackets to indicate
                    conjectural additions would give them a significance over and above other sorts
                    of conjectural emendation, such as deletions and reordering, which would then
                    become down-graded as against additions. Arzhanov is again offering nothing more
                    substantial than a description of the difference between his own preferred
                    ‘diplomatic’ method and my ‘critical’ method.</p>

                    think, and these errors would still be errors under any other principle of
                    editing. They are corrigenda pure and simple, and can be corrected in any future

                <p xml:lang="syr">Here we come to what may be the clearest evidence of how
                    Arzhanov and I differ rather substantially in our approach to the critical
                    treatment of a corrupt tradition. This evidence shows how he is both more
                    reticent in his editorial method (for he prefers to print the ms rather than to
                    offer emendations) and yet also more reckless (for he offers as possible causes
                    of error some extremely improbable suggestions and on this basis retreats into a
                    thoroughgoing skepticism).</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">A rather anodyne example will make the general point clearly enough. Arzhanov
                    writes (p.528):</p>
                <cit>
                    <quote>104.26 <foreign xml:lang="syr">ܐܢܐ</foreign> ms : <foreign xml:lang="syr">ܐܢܬ</foreign>
                    ed. — The editor’s variant is based on the fact that the transmitted Greek text
                    has 2nd person sg. However, it remains possible that the Syriac translator 1)
                    had another variant in his Greek copy, or 2) preferred to change it for some
                    reason.</quote>
                </cit>
                <p xml:lang="en">In fact, these two alternative suggestions are barely worth a moment’s
                    consideration. All known Greek witnesses read ΕΡΕΙΣ (<hi rend="italic">you
                        say</hi>). Moreover, this is a standard piece of Aristotelian style which
                    offers the translator normally no difficulty and he elsewhere always translates
                    it correctly. Arzhanov’s suggestion (1) that the translator had a different
                    Vorlage is extremely unlikely (ΕΡΕΙΣ &gt; ΕΡΩ is a most unlikely error; and I do
                    not believe in speculating Greek variants not otherwise attested in the
                    tradition, although Arzhanov seems happy to posit a new Greek variant for almost
                    any reason to exculpate the Syriac scribes). The suggestion (2) that it was a
                    <hi rend="italic">deliberate </hi>alteration on the part of
                    the translator is even more absurd, since no conceivable reason for this can be
                    imagined and in no other location does he make any comparable alteration. Hence
                    any editor would come to the same, rather obvious, conclusion as I did, viz.
                    that this is most plausibly understood as a scribal error. </p>
                <p xml:lang="en">What should become at once apparent from this somewhat insignificant, but still
                    telling, example, is that Arzhanov is much the <hi rend="italic">more</hi>
                    speculative editor of the two of us. I have opted for the most likely
                    explanation, viz. scribal error, and emended the text accordingly; he speculates
                    about unknown Greek variants and deliberate translational alterations, both
                    without any evidence; and then decides to leave the text as it is on the basis
                    of the consequent uncertainty regarding the source of the error. In my view,
                    this is at once to over-speculate about the unknown and to surrender the
                    responsibility of the careful editor.</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">Here follow a selection from the other examples that he offers (pp.508-512),
                    demonstrating in each case the basic soundness of the principles of my edition,
                    and the superfluity (sometimes absurdity) of his doubts:</p>

                    transmitted text stands in need of correction and the emendation is required for
                    the grammar. The Gk text here is not in dispute and the mechanism of error is
                    reasonably clear, viz. the translator, eager to preserve the Gk word order,
                    translated the genitive τῶν δευτέρων οὐσιῶν at the start of the sentence; a
                    later scribe had trouble with the resulting unnaturalness and has omitted the
                    <foreign xml:lang="syr">ܕ</foreign>, thereby
                    confusing where the “secondary substances” belong, in the foregoing or the
                    succeeding sentence. Arzhanov’s contention that “the editor’s correction
                    is…based on the assumption that the Syriac translator was trying to render the
                    transmitted Greek text in a way that would be close to the Greek” is accurate.
                    The translator was no fool; in fact I generally proceed on the basis that he was
                    very good at his job–anyone translating Aristotle would need to be, and this
                    translator did not knowingly write nonsense. Errors are therefore, <hi
                        rend="italic">a priori</hi>, far more likely caused by an uncomprehending
                    scribe than by a translator who certainly
                    <hi rend="italic">did </hi>understand what he was
                    translating. Moreover, the
                    <hi rend="italic">mechanism </hi>of error is clear once one
                    sees the (not-in-dispute) Vorlage–this is to follow Gutas’s principle of using
                    our knowledge of the Greek text wisely and critically.</p>

                    Arzhanov’s objection is superfluous. The translator nowhere else writes <foreign xml:lang="syr">ܦܘܪܫܐ</foreign>, but always
                    <foreign xml:lang="syr">ܦܘܪܫܢܐ</foreign>. The

                    Arzhanov, the grammar cannot stand without the particle. He offers <foreign xml:lang="syr">ܕ</foreign> as an
                    alternative. Perhaps. Indeed, suggestions for alternative emendations to the

                    extraordinarily, Arzhanov seems to think that positing a speculative and
                    imaginary Greek variant would be a
                    <hi rend="italic">better </hi>explanation for the corrupt
                    trans-mitted text than inner-Syriac scribal error. He suggests the evidence is
                    not decisive – that there are other possibilities. Naturally no evidence will be
                    wholly decisive in the case of a corrupt tradition, but the question at hand is
                    one of the balance of probabilities. Any critic is more than welcome to differ
                    in the application of the critical principles–but the principles themselves
                    remain secure.</p>

                    Arzhanov is wholly misguided in thinking that I am in any way using JG to emend
                    Anon. I add “cf. JG” to alert the reader’s notice to a datum (<hi rend="italic"
                        >confer</hi> simply means “take a look at”) – it in no way implies that I am
                    using JG as a basis for the emendation. The reason for the emendation is the
                    same as in all the other cases, viz. that the text is corrupt. The Greek surely
                    read τούτων δὲ οὐδέν…, and elsewhere this would always, by this translator, be
                    rendered as <foreign xml:lang="syr">ܡܢ ܗܠܝܢ ܕܝܢ
                        ܘܠܐ</foreign> .... The mechanism of corruption is more than tolerably apparent.
                    That “Anon was not consistent and modified the Greek original” (Arzhanov, p.509)
                    is an absurd speculation based on no comparative evidence. On the con-trary,
                    without <foreign xml:lang="syr">ܡܢ</foreign> the
                    Syriac text makes no sense; the intent of the overall sentence is abundantly
                    clear; there is no possibility of a Greek variant (were one known) explaining
                    the transmitted Syriac text. In all, only one sensible solution offers itself to
                    any reader, namely that <foreign xml:lang="syr"
                        >ܡܢ</foreign> has dropped out in transmission (a ready and likely error for a
                    scribe not accustomed to the material). The editor’s responsibility to insert
                    <foreign xml:lang="syr">ܡܢ</foreign> is thus

                    is another instance of the same balance of probabilities. The mechanism of
                    error, together with awareness of the translator’s style and the Greek Vorlage,
                    combine to offer the editor a good idea of how the transmitted text has emerged.
                    Arzhanov’s complaint appears to be that there is less explanation on the
                    editor’s part than he would like. For each and every textual decision to be
                    explicated in full would be a task beyond the confines of a single volume.</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">120,8 <foreign xml:lang="syr">ܠܦܘܬ</foreign> ms <foreign xml:lang="syr">ܠܘܬ</foreign> ed. Being in
                    possession of the Vorlage allows the editor to perceive readily enough the
                    mechanism of corruption. But Arzhanov’s predilections have again got the better
                    of his critical sense, for he writes, “since the Syriac translator is not always
                    consistent…it seems better to have the ms variant in the main text.” This is a
                    non sequitur. On Arzhanov’s logic, since no translator is ever consistent and
                    most are rather the opposite, we should never do anything but reproduce the text
                    of a ms–why not just make it available online and retire? The translator’s
                    inconsistency does not at all entail that we surrender the critical task and
                    just print the ms text–the two things have nothing to do with one another. </p>

                    received text is not impossible, but requires us to take a very low view of the
                    translator’s capacity. Since there is a fault, far more likely that the culprit
                    be a scribe who knew not the meaning of what he was writing, than the translator
                    who clearly did.</p>

                    The ms reading cannot be a translation of ἀπόφασις–it would have quite another

                    ἀπόφασις. There is a close visual similarity between text and conjecture, a
                    clear mechanism of corruption, and the translator’s normal equivalents are
                    well-established. In my judgement, there is an almost zero chance that the
                    transmitted text is what the translator wrote.</p>

                    admits that the proposed emendation is probably right, yet still refuses it
                    entry into the critical text because 1) the Gk Vorlage could have been different
                    from anything attested in the Greek tradition; 2) because the translator might
                    have interpreted it thus. However, the transmitted text is nonsense and no
                    translator who could even half understand Aristotle would have written <foreign xml:lang="syr">ܥܡ ܟܠ</foreign> .
                    <hi rend="italic">Not </hi>to place the emendation in the

                    minor alterations, i.e. the diplomatic edition that Arzhanov prefers and which
                    he prepared for Hunaynnet.</p>

                    Arzhanov accuses: “it would seem that by changing the Syriac text, the modern
                    editor is correcting not the errors of textual transmission, but rather the
                    Syriac translator of the 6th century.” Not in the least. The editor is
                    correcting what is manifestly a scribal error. Arzhanov’s logic is faulty.
                    Correcting the scribe is precisely what is being done, for such is the editor’s
                    task. If Arzhanov would like to ascribe the error to incompetent translation, he
                    had better find some good evidence first.</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">The comments about the use of square and angled brackets (p.512) shows a lack of
                    understanding of how these instru-menta work. Arzhanov expects that angled
                    brackets would be used to indicate conjectural additions (I have explained above
                    why this ought not to be the case) and seems to be under the illusion that
                    square brackets are used to indicate textual conjectural additions as well. In
                    fact, in line with most English cribs of Syriac texts, square brackets indicate
                    words added to ease the flow of a translation and have nothing to do with the
                    critical work on the Syriac text itself. </p>
                <p xml:lang="en">Throughout these examples, the paradox of Arzhanov’s position is that his
                    non-emendations require far greater speculation than my own conjectures–for <hi
                        rend="italic">he</hi> must always be forced either to invent a Greek variant
                    without attestation to account for a strange Syriac translation, or else he must
                    posit a translator who had little idea what he was doing and simul-taneously a
                    scribe or scribes who had a rather better idea. By contrast, I never make
                    emendations based on imaginary Greek readings, and I emend what may be adjudged
                    to be scribal errors wherever the mechanism of error can be discerned, minor
                    errors in transmission being <hi rend="italic">prima facie</hi> more likely than
                    imagining a translator who knew even less Greek than he did Syriac.</p>

                <p xml:lang="syr">“Anon turns out to be a highly unstable version that
                    frequently changes its use of terminology and translation technique; its author
                    (or authors) seems frequently to have had difficulties in grasping the precise
                    meaning of the Aristotelian text; and it seems to be possibly based on an
                    imperfect copy of the Greek text” (p.513).</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">Not at all. There is no evidence that the translator’s Greek copy was any more
                    defective than any normal ms would have been. Arzhanov offers no evidence to the
                    contrary. Moreover, as I demonstrated in the book, the translator had a good
                    understanding of a difficult text. He did not yet have a stable tradition of
                    Syriac renderings with which to work, and this is the explanation for his
                    inconsistencies–they are the inconsis-tencies of an experimenter, not those of a
                    confused tyro. This would suggest that, far from being the product of a
                    pre-existing pedagogical tradition, this translator was working in something of
                    a vacuum. He was inventing a field largely <hi rend="italic">de novo</hi>, and
                    was remarkably successful.</p>

                    errors of MV are also found in BP. There are (see p.287) a few shared MV errors;
                    this “should” mean that these errors are found throughout the tradition back to
                    [ω] and hence “must” be in BP as well. If BP have any right readings where MV
                    are in error, then the stemma will need further rethinking. But this is only a

                    assume that the translator was at fault and that the text as transmitted,
                    barring only the most obvious errors, is in all major particulars the text that
                    came off the desk of the translator. Were it so, we could confidently
                    reconstruct his Vorlage and also describe in some detail his technical failings.
                    However, it was not so. The text was poorly treated in the years between
                    original translation and extant copy. The translator, albeit that he was an
                    experimenter and a pioneer, had a strong grip on his task and executed it
                    remarkably well. This places the onus on any editor to make every effort to
                    present to the wider reading public, and especially to editors of the Greek
                    Aristotle, the actual words that the translator most likely wrote, and this
                    requires more conjectural emendation than is found in many other Syriac texts.

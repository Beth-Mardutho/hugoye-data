    Following volumes covering the Major Catholic Epistles (1986),
    Romans and I Corinthians (1991), and II Corinthians, Galatians,
    Ephesians, Philippians and Colossians (1995), the present
    publication is the fourth tome of Syriac New Testament texts
    edited by Barbara Aland and Andreas Juckel, both of the
    Institut für neutestamentlichen Textforschung in
    Münster. All volumes appeared in the same series, in a
    format that has remained essentially unchanged. Taken together,
    they make up an impressive contribution to the study of the
    Syriac text of the New Testament.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P2"/>[2] The most
    substantial part of the book is an edition of the Syriac text
    of the Corpus Paulinum from I Thessalonians through Hebrews as
    attested in the Peshitta, in the Harklean, and in quotations in
    Syriac literature. The different Syriac versions are presented
    verse by verse in horizontal lines. The Peshitta is given in a
    diplomatic edition taking British Library Add. 14.470 (5/6th
    century, referred to as <hi rend="bold">P4</hi>) as the basic text. The
    apparatus signals variant readings in eleven other, mostly
    early, manuscripts. Although this is not a full critical
    edition of the Peshitta, the editors are certainly right in
    judging that the variants included are representative for the
    entire early history of the version. Since no other critical
    edition was ever made of the Peshitta Epistles (the British and
    Foreign Bible Society edition of 1920 offered an eclectic text
    based on early manuscripts, but no apparatus), this segment
    alone—which forms a small part of the volume as a whole
    — merits NT scholars' eternal gratitude.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P3"/>[3] The
    Harklean is presented in a critical edition based on three
    manuscripts, the most important of which is Ms 37 of St. Mark's
    monastery in Jerusalem (8/9th century, referred to as
    <hi rend="bold">H4</hi>). Here too, the new edition improves much on the
    earlier edition of Joseph White (1803), which was based on a
    single manuscript (breaking off at Hebr. 11:27). The
    translation technique of the Harklean, which aims at formal
    equivalence with the Vorlage, makes it easy to retrovert into
    Greek. A retroversion of the Harklean epistles—prepared
    in comparison with the minuscules of "Family 2138" which are
    closely allied to the Vorlage of the Harklean—is proposed
    on 452-494.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P4"/>[4] The real
    bonus of the present edition, however, and a breathtaking tour
    de force, is the collection of quotations in Syriac literature.
    Thousands of quotations, excerpted from more than 160 writings,
    dating from the fourth century to Bar Hebraeus, both originally
    Syriac and translated from Greek, are transcribed in extenso
    and presented in chronological order alongside the Peshitta and
    Harklean versions. All the material is there for a historical
    study of the Syriac text of the Pauline epistles, from the
    earliest Old Syriac stage, through the Peshitta, the
    Philoxenian and the Harklean versions, to post-Harklean efforts
    at taking the imitation of the Greek language to its limit. The
    editors are justified in expressing the hope that "the wealth
    of material in our three volumes shall elicit corresponding
    researches" (p. V).</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P5"/>[5] In
    comparison with the edition of the Old Testament Peshitta by
    the Peshitta Institute in Leiden, the present edition clearly
    expresses different options. The strength of the Peshitta
    Institute's approach lies in its focus on the manuscript
    tradition, treating the manuscripts (or at least the earlier
    ones) exhaustively. This has made it possible to write a
    history of the OT Peshitta text—something that is neither
    attempted nor achieved in the Münster edition for the text
    of the NT Peshitta. In contrast, Aland and Juckel and their
    team have selected a more global approach, where the Peshitta
    text is set in the context of earlier and later Syriac versions
    of the New Testament. Partly the different policies are
    dictated by differences in the material: in the Syriac OT there
    is no analogue to the Old Syriac version, and while the
    Peshitta is based on the Hebrew OT the later versions are based
    on the Septuagint. Yet, one might also say that the two
    projects form a challenge to one another, pointing to possible
    paths for future research.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P6"/>[6] Apart
    from the text edition and its paraphernalia (information on the
    manuscripts, information on the Syriac writings from which the
    quotations were excerpted, indexes), the volume contains brief
    discussions on the textual history of the Peshitta (Ch. III)
    and the Harklean (Ch. IV). These chapters are highly
    instructive and reflect the same standards of professionalism
    as the text edition. They should be required reading for
    advanced students with an interest in the Syriac Bible. With
    regard to the Harklean it is shown that variant readings can
    generally be classified as errors, assimilations to the
    Peshitta, or "grecizations" designed to conform the Syriac even
    more to the Greek text. More important, it is convincingly
    argued that the Harklean base text was translated from a single
    Greek manuscript while asterisks and marginal readings were
    taken from another manuscript (and perhaps from the Philoxenian
    version as well). The obelos marks elements required by Syriac
    idiom that have no precise counterpart in the Greek. The
    Harklean version was not a mere revision of the Philoxenian but
    an entirely new translation of a Greek manuscript. A
    confrontation of these views with the famous subscription to
    the Harklean version leads to a new interpretation of the
    Syriac text. The key terms are <hi rend="italic">’tktb</hi> "to be
    produced" (said of a biblical manuscript) and
    <hi rend="italic">’tp<hi rend="u">h</hi>m</hi> "to be annotated with
    variant readings".</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P7"/>[7] With
    regard to the Peshitta the great homogeneity (Konformität)
    of the manuscript tradition is correctly observed. The majority
    of variants are of relatively little consequence. Three classes
    of variants are identified by Aland and Juckel: a) variants
    bringing the Peshitta text closer to the Greek or to a specific
    Greek reading (in many cases variation within the Greek
    tradition is reflected in Peshitta manuscripts as well); b)
    idiomatic changes taking their origin in the genius of the
    Syriac language (some of these may be caused by influence from
    the elusive "Old Syriac" version of the epistles); c) in Old
    Testament quotations, readings created by influence of the Old
    Testament Peshitta. The dynamics of the manuscript tradition
    are discussed in some detail and illustrated with 59 annotated
    examples.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P8"/>[8] It is in
    the discussion on the Peshitta, where questions of Syriac idiom
    and translation technique are relatively more important than
    textual traditions, that one may occasionally disagree with the
    editors. First a question of detail. In Hebr. 1:7,
    <hi rend="italic">d<hi rend="sup">c</hi>bd mlakwhy rw<hi rend="u">h</hi>
            </hi>, the
    editors prefer the reading <hi rend="italic">rw<hi rend="u">h</hi>y</hi>,
    with 1cs suffix, offered by three manuscripts over the majority
    reading <hi rend="italic">rw<hi rend="u">h</hi>
            </hi>, in the status
    absolutus (19). The original Peshitta rendering, "who makes my
    spirit into his angels" (Er macht meinem Geist zu seinen
    Engeln), was later corrected on the basis of the text of the OT
    Peshitta of Psalm 104:4, so they argue. This evaluation is
    certainly wrong. The status absolutus is original, and the
    Syriac clause means "who makes his angels into (or out of)
    wind". The addition of the suffix is due to scribes'
    unfamiliarity with the status absolutus of nouns functioning as
    nexus objects: a type of syntax that is common in the OT
    Peshitta but disappears in later Syriac texts. They
    "syriacized" the form by adding a silent yudh of the suffix.
    The phenomenon is often met with in unusual cases of status
    absolutus (for examples, see J. Joosten, The Syriac Language of
    the Peshitta and Old Syriac Versions of Matthew [Leiden: Brill,
    1996], 73, n. 46).</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P9"/>[9] A more
    important issue is the question of OT Peshitta influence on the
    text of OT quotations (notably in Hebrews, where such
    quotations are numerous). According to Aland and Juckel, this
    influence is secondary: OT Peshitta readings creep into the
    manuscript tradition, creating variants (10, 20). This reviewer
    would argue the opposite: OT Peshitta influence on the
    quotations occurred in the earliest stage of the textual
    tradition. The factor creating variant readings is the
    influence of the Greek NT text with which the OT Peshitta text
    quoted in the NT Peshitta was often at variance. Later scribes
    corrected readings conforming with the OT Peshitta in order to
    bring the text into line with the Greek text of Hebrews. Three
    arguments favour this alternative view. First, readings
    influenced by the OT Peshitta occur quite frequently in all
    manuscripts without variation. Thus in Hebr. 5:6 and 7:21, the
    words <hi rend="italic">bdmwth dmlkyzdq</hi>, "in the likeness of Melchizedek,"
    attested by all Peshitta manuscripts, do not reflect the Greek
    text of Hebrews (κατα την
    ταξιν
    Μελχισεδεκ),
    "according to the order of M.") but the text of the OT Peshitta
    of Psalm 110:4. Similar instances of OT Peshitta influence
    attested by the entire manuscript tradition, can be found in
    Hebr. 1:7, 8, 10; 2:7, 12; 3:7, 9, 10; 8:9, 11; 10:5-6; 13:6
    (of course, each case merits a discussion, which cannot be
    given in the present review). Such cases tend to show that OT
    Peshitta readings belong to the original Peshitta translation
    of Hebrews. Second, it seems that the Old Syriac text of
    Hebrews contained even more traces of OT Peshitta influence
    than does the Peshitta. Thus, Aphrahat's version of Hebr. 2:13
    (Isa. 8:17-18) and 8:8-12 (Jer. 31:31-34) stands closer to the
    OT Peshitta text than does the Peshitta in several details. The
    Peshitta version of Hebrews apparently followed an established
    trend in adopting such readings. Third, the situation in the
    gospels furnishes a relevant analogy. In the gospels there can
    be no doubt that the Old Syriac's OT quotations show more OT
    Peshitta influence than do the Peshitta gospels (see J.
    Joosten, Textus 15 [1990], 55-76). Here the movement is clearly
    from a text more closely aligned with the OT Peshitta toward
    greater conformity with the Greek text of the NT. The same
    general evolution of the text of OT quotations would seem to
    hold for Hebrews (and for the other Pauline epistles).</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P10"/>[10] As
    far as the present reviewer has been able to check, the Syriac
    texts are transcribed with great trustworthiness. The only
    mistakes I have been able to identify occur in non-German
    titles in the bibliography: 543 "AMPHOUX (...) le
    group"—read "groupe"; 545 "CURETON (...) ancient
    recension"—read "antient" (sic); "DCB (...) Biography,
    Literatur"—read "Literature"; 546 "DUVAL (...)
    jusque'à"—read "jusqu'à"; 548 "PETIT (...)
    text grec"—read "texte"; 550 "WRIGHT (...) Syriac
    litterature" —read "literature". But these are mere
    trifles.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P11"/>[11] It
    is very much to be hoped that the team will go on with this
    project and publish at least the Book of Acts in the same way.
    The Minor Catholic Epistles and the Apocalypse would also
    benefit immensely, even although there is no Peshitta
    translation for these books (nor early quotations). Even for
    the Gospels the treatment would provide a useful complement to
    Gwilliam and Pusey's edition of the Peshitta and G. Kiraz's
    comparative edition of the Old Syriac, Peshitta and Harklean
    versions.</p>

            <anchor corresp="P1"/>[1] For over
    fifty years Patriarch Ignatios Aphram Barsoum’s
    introduction to Syriac literature, <hi rend="italic">The Scattered
    Pearls</hi>, has been an essential tool for specialist Syriac
    scholars, and yet it has not had as wide an impact outside the
    Middle East as it deserves because it has only been available
    in the original Arabic version (<hi rend="italic">Kitab al-Lu’lu’
    al-Manthur</hi>) and in a Syriac translation (<hi rend="italic">Ktobo
    d-Berulle Bdire</hi>), and before their republication by the
    Bar Hebraeus Press in Holland even copies of these editions
    were difficult to locate.<note place="foot" xml:id="#FN1" n="1">
                    <p rend="footnote text">
             The first Arabic edition was published in Homs in
    1943. The second edition, from which this present translation
    was made, was published in Aleppo in 1956. A third edition or
    printing appeared in Baghdad in 1976, and a fourth was printed
    by the Bar Hebraeus Verlag in Glane/Losser in 1987. There were
    further reprints of the second edition at the Mardin Press in
    Aleppo in 1987 and 1996. A Syriac translation of the second
    edition was produced by Mor Philoxenos Yohanna Dolabani and
    published in Qamishli in 1967, and this was also reprinted by
    the Bar Hebraeus Verlag in Glane/Losser in 1992.

                </note> This complete translation into
    English by Matti Moosa, the first into any European language,
    is thus to be warmly welcomed because it will enable a far
    wider readership to gain access to the riches of
    Barsoum’s work.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P2"/>[2]
    Patriarch Aphram Barsoum (1887-1957) was one of a group of
    Syrian Orthodox and Syrian Catholic scholars in the early
    twentieth-century Middle East (the other notable figures being
    Mor Philoxenos Yohanna Dolabani [1885-1969], Mor Gregorios
    Behnam [1916-1969], and from the Catholic side Patriarch
    Ignatios Aphrem Rahmani [1848-1929] and Ishaq Armalto
    [1879-1954]) who made significant contributions to Syriac
    studies not only because of their profound knowledge of their
    own traditions and manuscripts, but also because of their
    familiarity with the great manuscript collections of Europe and
    with the writings of the European orientalists.
    (Barsoum’s publications included an edition of the
    Chronicle to A.D. 819 in the CSCO, and articles in western
    journals, as well as the numerous Arabic works listed on p.x of
    the introduction.) As is clear from Part II of the Epilogue to
    this volume, entitled ‘On the incoherence of some
    orientalists and their false charges against our learned men,
    and their refutation’, the orientalist tradition was not
    received uncritically. Some of Barsoum’s criticisms were
    levelled at academic denials of the historicity of certain
    religious texts (such as the Doctrina Addai, and a number of
    hagiographical works), but others were directed towards
    erroneous claims and statements made by Europeans which were
    simply the product of their ignorance of Syriac texts and
    traditions, whether through inadequate reading and research, or
    uncritical reliance upon earlier scholarship, or through lack
    of access to Syriac manuscripts in the Middle East.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P3"/>[3] These
    criticisms draw attention to the key methodological strengths
    and weaknesses of Barsoum’s <hi rend="italic">Scattered Pearls</hi>. In
    his very useful introduction Moosa declares (p.xiv): ‘It
    is clear that the Western reader must accept
    <hi rend="italic">al-Lu’lu’ al-Manthur</hi> on its own terms, as
    the work of an Eastern scholar writing for an Eastern audience.
    He must also bear in mind that Barsoum is the Patriarch of
    Antioch, the head of the Syrian Church’. This is pretty
    loaded and controversial language, but I take the thrust of the
    first sentence to be that the balanced coverage of different
    literary genres and the critical analysis of sources is not
    always that which might be expected from an academic study
    produced by a university trained Syriac scholar, whether from
    the Middle East or elsewhere, and in this Moosa is certainly
    correct. The second statement also carries much force. Barsoum
    is sensitive to any implied criticisms of the antiquity of
    Syrian institutions or of the literary and theological genius
    of the great Syriac authors. (He is, however, perfectly happy
    to criticise the literary merits of certain minor Syriac poets
    and theologians.) As the patriarch of the Syrian Orthodox
    Church he also strictly limits his history to the writers of
    his own tradition, and so no mention will be found here of
    Maronite or Syrian Catholic writers, let alone those of the
    Church of the East or the Chaldeans. (For these traditions
    use might be made of the works of Alber Abuna [Beirut, 1970]
    and Pera Sarmas [Tehran, 1962 - 1970], which could also
    profitably be translated into a European language, despite
    having been, with Barsoum, the key sources for Rudolf
    Macuch’s <hi rend="italic">Geschichte der spät- und neusyrischen
    Literatur</hi> [Berlin, 1976].)</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P4"/>[4] The
    other side to Barsoum’s focus on Syrian Orthodox
    traditions and authors is that he is able to write about these
    with real authority, based on a life-time’s study of
    primary materials. Among his quoted sources are the literary
    histories and bibliographies of Assemani, Wright, Duval,
    Chabot, and Baumstark, as well as the catalogues of all the
    major European collections of Syriac manuscripts, and yet
    Barsoum is frequently able to correct their statements about
    the details of the lives of key Syriac authors on the basis of
    Syriac sources available to him (although rarely referenced),
    as well as to call attention to Syriac texts either unknown to
    western scholars or previously thought lost. He is also
    interested in the continuity of the Syriac literary tradition
    down to his own day, and so includes many authors omitted from
    the western literary histories which frequently come to an
    abrupt halt in the late thirteenth or fourteenth centuries.
    Because he had himself catalogued many of the Syrian Orthodox
    manuscript collections (a list of his unpublished catalogues is
    included in the table of his sources), Barsoum is frequently
    able to identify which of these libraries preserve manuscripts
    of specific works and authors. (Frustratingly, if
    unsurprisingly, no catalogue numbers or shelf marks are
    provided for these Syrian Orthodox manuscripts, but these can
    sometimes be determined by cross-referencing the <hi rend="italic">Scattered
    Pearls</hi> with the three handwritten catalogues of Dolabani
    published by the Mardin Press in Aleppo in 1994, or with the
    catalogue of the Patriarchal manuscript collection published by
    Dolabani, Lavenant, and Brock [PdO 19 (1994) 555-661].) Any
    scholar or student interested in post-sixth-century authors in
    particular would thus be well advised to consult Barsoum as a
    matter of course, although never to the exclusion of the
    established bibliographies of Baumstark and Duval etc.
    Barsoum’s <hi rend="italic">Scattered Pearls</hi> is an essential
    supplement and corrective to such works, but does not replace
    them (and neither was it intended to do so).</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P5"/>[5] The
    first 218 pages of the <hi rend="italic">Scattered Pearls</hi> (which Moosa
    first translated as his 1965 PhD thesis at Columbia University)
    contains a history of Syriac literature divided by genre and
    theme. Some of these sections provide very cursory accounts of
    their subject; the Bible is covered in one and a half pages,
    for example, and Theology in two and a half pages.
    ‘Church Liturgies’, however, which are so
    frequently marginalised in other literary histories, are here
    given 64 pages, with very full listings of anaphoras, plus
    tables of categorised liturgical manuscripts from libraries in
    both the Middle East and Europe. Also noteworthy are the
    sections on ‘Centres of Learning’, ‘Syriac
    Libraries’, and ‘Syriac Calligraphy’, the
    last of which is accompanied, in an appendix, by a lengthy list
    of celebrated Syriac scribes. All of these sections can be
    rather tantalising, however, because the very interesting raw
    data they contain is rarely provided with any references to
    sources. Yet in many of these short chapters Barsoum includes
    the names of Syriac authors and works which have evaded the
    nets of western scholars, and so even an apparently superficial
    section can contain material not readily to be found in other
    bibliographies.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P6"/>[6] For most
    readers I suspect it will be the second section of the
    <hi rend="italic">Scattered Pearls</hi> pp. 219 - 524 in Moosa’s
    translation, which will be found to be most helpful. This
    contains the biographies of 294 Syriac writers<note place="foot" xml:id="#FN2" n="2">

             Taking into account the typographical slip by which
    Bardaisan and the Odes of Solomon are both numbered 3, and the
    unnumbered entry for Dionysius Saliba is introduced by Moosa
    after 233 from its original place in an addendum in the Arabic
    text!

                </note> ordered
    chronologically from Wafa the Aramaean poet (who is said to be
    pre-Christian) down to Fr. Yaʿqub Saka who
    died in 1931. These entries are very readable, and the
    combination of biography and bibliography can be highly
    illuminating. Given the wealth of material that is now
    available elsewhere on the great Syriac authors of the fourth
    and fifth centuries, there is little in the accounts of the
    writers of these periods that will excite the scholar, and some
    detail and arguments that will seem rather dated. It is in his
    account of authors of later periods, whose texts are still read
    and studied in the Syrian Orthodox monasteries and seminaries,
    that Barsoum really comes into his own. (There are 57 listed
    authors, for example, who post-date Bar Hebraeus.) Many of
    these figures are little known to western scholars, and it is
    clear that many would repay closer study.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P7"/>[7] As
    someone who prior to the publication of Moosa’s English
    translation had always previously made use of Dolabani’s
    1967 Syriac translation of Barsoum’s <hi rend="italic">Scattered
    Pearls</hi>, I thought it might be interesting to compare the
    two versions. Dolabani was very knowledgeable about the Syriac
    manuscripts in Syrian Orthodox church libraries and in private
    collections belonging to individual priests and families.
    Occasionally therefore he adds references in brackets within
    the main text, or in footnotes, to additional Syriac texts
    which he knows to have been written by certain authors, or to
    the present (i.e. 1967) location of manuscripts referred to by
    Barsoum. For example, on p.28, in reference to the library of
    Dayr al-Za‘faran (cf. Moosa p.15 §18), he notes that
    the majority of its books had been removed to the episcopal
    library of Mardin, which then contained more than a thousand
    volumes, and on p.34 (cf. Moosa p.20 para. 2) he notes that the
    Kharput manuscript referred to by Barsoum had recently been
    transferred to Dayr al-Zaʿfaran. Again, on
    p.581 (cf. Moosa p.519), he adds that the monk
    ʿAbd al-Nur also translated the Psalm
    Commentary of Daniel of Salah into Arabic. The number of such
    references should not be exaggerated, but they are clearly of
    some academic interest.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P8"/>[8] A
    comparison of the lists of biographies of Syriac authors in the
    two texts also reveals that there is a significant number of
    additions in the Syriac translation, and I think it might be
    helpful to list the additional entries, with Dolabani’s
    numbering:</p>
         <p>10. Basilios, bishop of Homs (d. 359)<lb/>
    11. Philon, bishop of Carpasia (d. 394) - an ascetic whom
    Barsoum suggests may have been the author of the Liber
    Graduum.<lb/>
    22. Gregory of Cyprus (C. 7, but said to be C. 4).<lb/>
    23. Xystus (C. 4)<lb/>
    110. Athanos of Amid (C. 7)<lb/>
    111. Philogrios (C. 7)<lb/>
    119. Theodotos (d. 729)<lb/>
    202-203. Abu al-Faisal Saad and Abu Nasr Yahya ibn Jrair of
    Tagrit (C. 11).<lb/>
    271. Presbyter John of Basibrina (C. 15)<lb/>
    272. Hasan bar Zurqo of Mosul (C. 15)<lb/>
    279. Presbyter Isa of Beth Shaddad of the Jezira (d.
    1495)<lb/>
    281. Deacon Nur ad-Din of Mardin (d. 1500)<lb/>
    289. Monk Abd al-Aziz, called Bar Sallaki (C. 16)<lb/>
    291. Rabban Jacob of Qastro d-Qasro (d. 1575)<lb/>
    303. Presbyter Lahdo of Habbob (C. 18)<lb/>
    306. Presbyter Isho Arboyo (fl. 1816)<lb/>
    309. Monk Isho Gribo (d. 1916)<lb/>
    313. Deacon Nimatallah Danno (d. 1951)<lb/>
    314. Patriarch Ignatios Aphram Barsoum (d. 1957)<lb/>
         </p>
         <p>Some of these are authors whom Barsoum had mentioned in the
    thematically organized first half of his book but had not
    included in this section, but the majority are additions by
    Dolabani himself. The most detailed, and perhaps most
    interesting, of these entries are those assigned to the
    post-fourteenth century authors, and fortunately the substance
    of these passages can be gleaned from Macuch’s work,
    mentioned above, since he was dependent on the Syriac
    translation of Barsoum rather than the Arabic original. In his
    introduction (p.xviii) Moosa asserts that ‘there is
    little in Bishop Dolabani’s translation that merits
    inclusion here’. As  I have indicated, I think
    Dolabani’s work does in fact continue to be of some
    independent value, and it would have been nice to see the
    relatively small amount of additional material incorporated
    into this present translation, but this is far from being a
    serious defect.</p>
         <p>

    of the typographical slips which plague most lengthy books.
    Moosa has provided an excellent critical introduction to
    Barsoum’s work which could almost be published as a
    review in its own right. He has also added occasional
    explanatory notes throughout the volume, and an absolutely
    essential index which is absent from all of the Arabic and
    Syriac editions of the <hi rend="italic">Scattered Pearls</hi> that I have
    seen. (The multiplicity of names and titles given to various
    people has occasionally resulted in individual authors being
    given multiple entries in the index, each with distinct sets of
    page references. I noticed ‘Basil’ and
    ‘Basilius’; ‘Amid’ and
    ‘Diyarbakir’; ‘Anton of Takrit’ and
    ‘Anton Rhetor’; and in one unfortunate case
    ‘Areopagite’ and ‘Dionysius the
    Areopagite’ and ‘Pseudo-Dionysius’! Let the
    reader beware! If a third edition is ever planned it might also
    be useful to replace the large numbers of page references
    listed under the headings of named libraries of Syriac
    manuscripts with a separate index of numbered or categorised
    Syriac manuscripts mentioned in the text. These are, however,
    simply minor corrections.)</p>

    Moosa himself acknowledges, the <hi rend="italic">Scattered Pearls</hi>

         <div type="abstract">
            <p>This essay argues that the text known as
    the Letter of Mara bar Serapion is an example of a Greek
    rhetorical exercise, the chreia elaboration. The letter fits
    the paradigm of the chreia elaboration as it is found in Greek
    rhetorical handbooks, such as those of Theon and Libanius.
    Since it is a rhetorical exercise, the letter should not be
    read as straightforward evidence for the experience of Roman
    conquest in Syria, nor should it be read as evidence for
    Christian apologetic practice in early Syriac literature.
    Rather, the letter provides scholars with the opportunity to
    examine the interaction between Greek rhetorical literature and
    the rise of Syriac prose literature in late
    antiquity.</p>

    <hi rend="italic">Letter of Mara bar Serapion to his Son</hi>, known through
    a sixth- or seventh-century manuscript (BM Add. 14658) edited
    in the nineteenth century by William Cureton, is a
    little-studied document in scholarship on Syriac
    literature.<note place="foot" xml:id="FN1" n="1">

                </note> The difficulties involved in dating the work and
    determining the religious and philosophical persuasion of its
    author, in addition to the general lack of philosophical
    creativity in the text itself, have relegated the letter to a
    secondary position in the study of early Syriac literature and
    Syriac Christianity.<note place="foot" xml:id="FN2" n="2">
                    <p rend="footnote text">
             There have been very few studies of the letter in
    the past century. The major bibliography is: Kathleen McVey, “A
    Fresh Look at the Letter of Mara Bar Serapion to his Son,”
    <hi rend="italic">V. Symposium Syriacum 1988</hi>, ed. R. Lavenant,
    <hi rend="italic">Orientalia Christiana Analecta</hi> 236 (1990): 257–72;
    Friedrich Schulthess, “Der Brief des Mara bar Sarapion,”
    <hi rend="italic">Zeitschrift der deutschen morgenländischen
    Gesellschaft</hi> 51 (1897): 365–91; and the comments of H. J.
    W. Drijvers in “Hatra, Palmyra und Edessa: Die Städte der
    syrisch-mesopotamischen Wüste in politischer,
    kulturgeschichtlicher und religionsgeschichtlicher
    Beleuchtung,” <hi rend="italic">ANRW</hi> II.8 (1977), at 886–87. I very much
    regret that the most recent article to appear on the letter,
    Ilaria Ramelli’s “La lettera di Mara bar Serapion,”
    <hi rend="italic">Stylos</hi> 13 (2004): 77–104, was unavailable to me at the
    time of writing and could not be incorporated into this
    article. 
         </p>
                </note> There have been strong arguments that the
    writer was not a Christian, but a Stoic sympathetic to
    Christianity;<note place="foot" xml:id="FN3" n="3">

         </p>
                </note> still, the examination of the letter by Kathleen
    McVey, presented in 1988, has to a certain extent re-opened the
    question of the author’s allegiances. The philosophical themes
    in the letter are not uniquely Stoic, as McVey points
    out;<note place="foot" xml:id="FN4" n="4">

         </p>
                </note> at the same time, the references to Christianity
    are marginal enough to the general rhetorical arc of the letter
    to cast doubt on McVey’s thesis that the author was a Christian
    propagandist.<note place="foot" xml:id="FN5" n="5">
                    <p rend="footnote text">

         </p>
                </note> Studies of the letter have in the main
    concentrated on its philosophical, religious, and historical
    content, and the relationship between its content and its
    putative author, rather than on its rhetorical form. A closer
    examination of the form of the letter may help place it more
    firmly in its ancient intellectual context, which, I argue, is
    that of a standard Greek rhetorical exercise, the chreia
    elaboration. When the text is situated in this rhetorical
    context, the murkiness of the historiographical questions
    surrounding the text’s date and “religious” character becomes
    in some ways easier to understand: if the author of the
    document is not an original Mara bar Serapion, but a later
    writer composing a prosopopoetic exercise in his name, the
    vagueness of historical detail in the letter and its relatively
    commonplace philosophical ideas become the stuff of classroom
    “general knowledge” rather than documents of individual
    experience or belief. This shift does not gain the historian
    any more evidence for a historical Mara bar Serapion, of
    course, but it does position the letter as further
    documentation for a tradition of interchange between Greek and
    Syriac rhetorical and educational traditions.</p>

         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P2"/>[2] The
    letter as it stands is in two parts: the letter itself, and a
    short anecdote about its supposed writer, Mara bar Serapion.
    The division between the two is stark: the letter, written
    primarily in the first person and addressed in the second, ends
    with the words: “And if anyone grieves or worries, I do not
    counsel him, for there in the life of the whole world he will
    find us before him.”<note place="foot" xml:id="FN6" n="6">

    48.22–23. Unless otherwise noted, all translations from ancient
    texts in this essay are my own. 
         </p>
                </note> The anecdote immediately follows, written
    in the third person, as an account of a conversation between
    Mara bar Serapion and a companion:</p>
         <quote>
      One of his friends asked Mara bar Serapion when he was bound
      at his side, “By your life, Mara, tell me what laughing-stock
      appeared to you, that you laughed?” Mara said to him, “I
      laughed at time, since, although it has not borrowed evil
      from me, it repays me.”<note place="foot" xml:id="FN7" n="7">
                    <p rend="footnote text">
             W. Cureton, <hi rend="italic">Spicilegium Syriacum</hi>,
    48.24–26. 
         </p>
                </note>
         </quote>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P3"/>[3] This
    anecdote is in the clearly recognizable form of a rhetorical
    chreia, a brief narrative, usually concerning a famous
    historical figure, that ends in a pithy remark or witty
    gesture. The second-century teacher Theon, in his
    <hi rend="italic">Progymnasmata</hi>, lists several types of chreiai, among
    which are “chreiai that offer an explanation in answer to a
    question…. For example, ‘When he was asked whether the Persian
    king seemed happy to him, Socrates said: “I can’t answer, since
    I can’t know what he thinks of education.”’”<note place="foot" xml:id="FN8" n="8">
                    <p rend="footnote text">
             Theon, <hi rend="italic">Progymnasmata</hi>, 3.52–54, text in
    James R. Butts, <hi rend="italic">The Progymnasmata of Theon</hi> (Ph.D.
    dissertation, Claremont Graduate School, 1987). 
         </p>
                </note> The story of Mara
    bar Serapion and his laughter seems to fit into this general
    type; it is difficult to imagine that ancient readers of the
    anecdote would not have recognized it immediately as an example
    of the genre. Indeed, as many writers on ancient Greek and
    Roman education have made clear, the chreia played a
    significant role even in elementary education in antiquity,
    being used to teach basic literacy, as well as to inculcate
    common social and cultural norms.<note place="foot" xml:id="FN9" n="9">
                    <p rend="footnote text">
             The most useful works on the chreia now available
    are the two volumes of edited and translated texts on the
    chreia, with introductions and analyses by Ronald F. Hock and
    Edward N. O’Neil, <hi rend="italic">The Chreia in Ancient Rhetoric</hi>, vol.
    1, <hi rend="italic">The Progymnasmata</hi> (Atlanta: Scholars Press, 1986),
    and vol. 2, <hi rend="italic">The Classroom Exercises</hi> (Atlanta: Scholars
    Press, 2002). A third volume is currently being prepared on the
    chreia in Byzantine commentaries and scholia. Other writers on
    education who comment helpfully on the uses of the chreia are
    Teresa Morgan, <hi rend="italic">Literate Education in the Hellenistic and
    Roman World</hi> (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1998),
    esp. at 186–89; and Raffaella Cribiore, <hi rend="italic">Gymnastics of the
    Mind: Greek Education in Hellenistic and Roman Egypt</hi>
    (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2001), 223–24; H.
    Marrou comments only occasionally on the chreia in his survey
    of primary and literary education in Greek antiquity: <hi rend="italic">A
    History of Education in Antiquity</hi> (tr. G. Lamb; New York:
    Sheed and Ward, 1956; reprinted Madison: University of
    Wisconsin Press, 1982). 
         </p>
                </note> As Ronald Hock and Edward
    O’Neil point out, many such chreiai take the form of a saying
    by a philosophical figure in answer to a question, and closing
    with a constrastive (usually, in Greek, <hi rend="italic">men…de</hi>)
    response, such as, “When Diogenes was asked why people give to
    beggars, but not to philosophers, he said, ‘Because people
    expect to become lame or blind, but they never expect to
    philosophize.’”<note place="foot" xml:id="FN10" n="10">

         </p>
                </note> This is almost precisely the form of the Mara
    bar Serapion chreia, with Mara bar Serapion being asked a
    question and responding with a contrast (“although [time] has
    not borrowed evil from me, it repays me”). The chreia at the
    end of the letter thus initially suggests a possible context,
    as an anecdote typically found in literary schooling.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P4"/>[4] The
    presence of a typical chreia at the end of the document takes
    on greater importance if the letter itself is also placed in a
    context of rhetorical exercises. As is well known, it was
    common for students of grammar and rhetoric in antiquity to
    compose themes both about historical figures, and centered on
    specific historical anecdotes in which these figures played a
    part.<note place="foot" xml:id="FN11" n="11">

                </note> Perhaps the richest set of examples are those
    collected in the <hi rend="italic">Suasoriae</hi> of the Elder Seneca, in
    which the embellishment of certain historical situations is
    standard to many of the exercises, such as the exercises on how

                </note> It was

    Theon’s <hi rend="italic">Progymnasmata</hi> is dedicated to prosopopoieia,
    and includes in its description of this rhetorical practice the
    creation of speeches attributed to “specific people: for
    example, what words would Cyrus speak as he moved on the
    Massagetae, or what would Datis say, after the battle of

                </note> This sort of
    composition was a familiar exercise for declamation, and
    Cribiore suggests, given the high rate of survival of examples,
    that such prosopopoetic writing was likely a favorite school
    practice.<note place="foot" xml:id="FN15" n="15">

    Mara bar Serapion</hi> was composed by a child, or anyone
    beginning to learn basic rhetorical techniques, I think it is
    not too much to suggest that it was composed as a prosopopoetic
    exercise by a writer deeply engaged with the Greek rhetorical
    tradition, and probably in a pedagogical context. Similarly,
    the authors of Seneca’s <hi rend="italic">Suasoriae</hi> were not
    “beginners,” but people to whom demonstration of rhetorical
    skill was professionally important, and whose work, for that
    reason, was pedagogically useful.</p>

    Following George Kennedy, scholars of ancient education have
    sometimes placed epistolary composition outside the main
    concentration of formal rhetorical education, suggesting that
    letter-writing was primarily taught as training for business or
    civil service.<note place="foot" xml:id="FN16" n="16">

                </note> Others, however, cite the use of model letters

    significantly for the purposes of this paper, it was also
    common practice for students to read and memorize chreiai, and
    to use them in composition. At the grammatical level, chreiai
    were used in exercises on the different declensions, and
    students were asked to decline chreiai rather repetitively, as
    in the <hi rend="italic">ars grammatica</hi> of Diomedes:</p>
         <quote>
      The chreia exercise varies by case as follows: in the

      of literature are bitter, but the fruits pleasing. In the
      genitive: the saying of Marcus Porcius Cato is remembered,
      that the roots of literature are bitter but the fruits
      pleasing. In the dative: it pleased Marcus Porcius Cato to

                </note> At a more advanced level,
    rhetoricians adopted the chreia for use in precisely the kind
    of historicizing composition discussed above. Students would
    have learned, then, to “expand” chreiai into historical
    narratives. Theon gives the following brief example:</p>
         <quote>
      For example, a concise chreia: Epameinondas, as he was dying
      childless, said to his friends: “I have left two
      daughters—the victory at Leuctra and the one at Mantineia.”
      Let us expand like this: Epameinondas, the Theban general,
      was of course a good man in time of peace, and when war
      against the Lacedaemonians came to his country, he displayed
      many outstanding deeds of great courage. As a Boeotarch at
      Leuctra, he triumphed over the enemy, and while campaigning
      and fighting for his country, he died at Mantineia. While he
      was dying of his wounds and his friends were lamenting, among
      other things, that he was dying childless, he smiled and
      said: “Stop weeping, friends, for I have left you two
      immortal daughters: two victories of our country over the
      Lacedaemonians, the one at Leuctra, who is the older, and the
      younger, who is just now being born at Mantineia.”<note place="foot" xml:id="FN24" n="24">

    think, be explained by the fact that the writer of the letter
    has framed his elaboration as a hortatory or paraenetic letter,
    an exercise in prosopopoieia, rather than more
    straightforwardly as a third-person account of the chreia and

    which are plundered? About cities, which are destroyed?” It
    then offers further examples of the opposite state of affairs
    by citing exempla of unfortunate figures of the past:
    “Therefore a man may rejoice in his kingdom like Darius, … or
    in his bravery like Achilles, or in his wife like Agamemnon, or
    in his son like Priam….” Following this section, the letter
    includes “testimony of the ancients” and examples in the form
    of further cases from history: “For how did the Athenians
    profit by the killing of Socrates? They received hunger and
    death in retribution for it. Or the people of Samos by the

            <anchor corresp="P8"/>[8] There
    are two key elements that I have not yet discussed, and that
    have been transformed by the prosopopoetic and hortatory
    framing of the letter. These are the paraphrase of the chreia
    and the elaboration of the philosophical rationale behind it.
    Nearly all of the examples of chreia elaboration include, after
    the encomium, a paraphrase of the chreia involved. Here, for
    example, is Libanius’ paraphrase of the following chreia:</p>
         <quote>
      When asked by someone where he kept his treasures, Alexander
      pointed to his friends. […] Paraphrastic. So, having
      approached him, a certain man said, “O King, I would gladly
      see your treasures.” And it seems to me that he was moved to
      do this when he saw that an entire nation had just been
      conquered, and was thinking that the result of this was a
      great deal of money. What, then, about Alexander? He did not
      reply immoderately, as if someone had asked him something
      inappropriate. And he did not order his servants to take the
      man and lead him around and show him lots of gold, or so many
      silver talents, or plenty of spoils, but directing the man to
      look at his friends, he said, “Do not seek any other wealth
      of Alexander. These are my treasures.”<note place="foot" xml:id="FN35" n="35">

         <p>The paraphrase here expands the chreia in several ways:
    first, it sets the chreia within a vaguely historicizing
    setting by suggesting that Alexander is fresh from a military
    victory.<note place="foot" xml:id="FN36" n="36">
                    <p rend="footnote text">

    after Alexander’s victory over Darius. 
         </p>
                </note> There is no evidence in the chreia that this
    is the setting for the event; it is entirely Libanius’
    invention. Libanius also adds the suggestion that there are,
    indeed, piles of gold, silver, and spoils there to be looked
    at, although Alexander ignores them. Finally, where the chreia
    does not have Alexander speak at all, Libanius invents a short
    conversation between Alexander and his inquirer. This kind of
    expansion appears to be typical of the paraphrases in chreia
    elaborations.<note place="foot" xml:id="FN37" n="37">

         <p>There follows a description of the people of Samosata
    grieving and in exile. Clearly, while the passage is not a
    direct paraphrase of the chreia, it serves some of the same
    purposes as the paraphrase: it provides a historical setting
    for the speaker, and invents dialogue to enliven the scene.
    Notably, this passage, and the lines following it, have been
    the lines on which historians have relied most heavily in
    attempting to date the letter; if it is right to think of the
    historicizing here as a deliberate rhetorical ploy, the power
    of this device is still in evidence.<note place="foot" xml:id="FN39" n="39">

                </note> The fact that
    this passage is not a direct paraphrase of the chreia may,

    exercise in prosopopoeia; Hock and O’Neil list no chreiai that
    are spoken in the first person, and the move in the letter
    outside the third person would create difficulty for a writer
    in summarizing what were purportedly his own actions and
    sayings. Assuming, then, that the prosopopoeia forbids the
    writer from paraphrasing directly, in the same way that it
    forces the encomium to be directed at the addressee rather than
    the speaker himself, the writer still uses the conventions of
    paraphrase to suggest a historical context for the speaker and
    to establish the setting of speaking to one’s companions more
    generally.</p>

         <p>Since the chreia is not directly paraphrased, however, the

    the chreia, and also provide its philosophical rationale. I
    turn to these themes next.</p>

            <anchor corresp="P11"/>[11] The
    main theme of the chreia is Mara bar Serapion’s philosophical
    indifference, expressed in his laughter. Secondary elements
    are: the presence of friends, the prison setting, the troubles
    of time, and the idea of ownership, as expressed in the
    metaphor of borrowing and lending. Each of these themes is
    found in the letter in order in various formulations, so that
    collectively these too suggest the dependence of the
    letter-writer on the previous existence of the chreia.</p>

    First, and most obvious in the letter and in the chreia, is the
    theme of philosophical indifference. The Mara bar Serapion of
    the chreia has separated himself from his troubles enough to
    take an ironic position with regard to them. Likewise, the Mara
    of the letter exhorts his son to the study of philosophy as the
    only way to separate himself from a variety of troubles. A
    series of philosophical clichés serve to bolster this
    exhortation: “Those who busy themselves with philosophy are
    looking to escape from the distresses of the world.”<note place="foot" xml:id="FN41" n="41">

    Indeed, as a concrete development of the idea of indifference,
    the writer of the letter focuses at length on the idea of the
    wise man’s attitude toward possessions. In the chreia, this
    theme is expressed in the metaphor of borrowing and lending; in
    the letter, its expression is much more literal. Again, the
    sentiments found in the letter are for the most part
    unexceptional: “And let not ownership subdue you, which many
    hunger after, and let it not entice your eye to desire riches,
    something which does not endure.”<note place="foot" xml:id="FN46" n="46">

    reflect a basic exposure to the philosophical parlance of

    especially in the sections devoted to the “philosophical
    rationale” of the chreia. For example, one chreia elaboration
    preserved in the work of Doxapatres explains this chreia as
    follows:</p>
         <quote>
      The saying of Aphthonius the rhetor is remembered, who said,
      “It is grievous to lose what has already been experienced.”
      […] The rationale: Since everyone prefers what is known to
      what is unknown, and since everything whose usefulness is

    specifically, the chreia suggests that Mara bar Serapion’s
    detachment is so great that he can laugh at his situation even
    when “bound.” Theon preserves a similar chreia about Socrates:
    “The philosopher Socrates, when a certain Apollodorus, an
    acquaintance, said to him, ‘The Athenians have unjustly
    sentenced you to death,’ responded, laughing, ‘But did you want
    them to do it justly?’”<note place="foot" xml:id="FN51" n="51">

                </note> In the letter, Mara bar

    wise man: “The poor seek and the rich conceal, and everyone
    laughs at his companion…. They rejoice in evil affairs and they

         </p>
                </note> The presence of
    this scornful laughter alongside Mara’s notes on human
    inconsistency recalls the two different kinds of laughter in
    the chreia: first, the “laughing-stock” that Mara’s friend sees
    nowhere in evidence, and second, the philosophical—and by
    ordinary standards unexpected—laughter of Mara bar Serapion
    himself. In the letter, the two types of laughter are developed
    into the full-blown themes of philosophical indifference and
    irony (the laughter of Mara bar Serapion), and the world’s
    rejection of the sage (expected laughter at a laughing-stock).
    Neither theme can claim either originality or development in
    the letter, but both give evidence of a basic grounding in
    ancient philosophical tropes in use in rhetorical training. On
    the assumption that the letter is secondary to the chreia, the
    unremarkableness of all of these sentiments is fairly easy to
    understand. If the author of the letter was more concerned with
    drawing out the themes implicit in the chreia than in advancing
    their philosophical development, s/he has done an admirable
    job. Moreover, in hortatory or paraenetic letters, it was not
    always considered good form to submit original philosophical
    insights. The epistolary manual of Pseudo-Libanius contains the
    following advice on writing paraenetic letters: “[P]araenesis
    is hortatory speech that does not admit of a counter-statement,
    for example, if someone should say that we must honor the
    divine. For nobody contradicts this exhortation were he not mad
    to begin with.”<note place="foot" xml:id="FN53" n="53">

    Perhaps the most interesting aspect of the letter s the
    writer’s use of the figure of time (<hi rend="italic">zabnâ</hi>). Here the
    ambivalence in the letter-writer’s interpretation of the chreia
    becomes obvious. “Time” in the chreia is personified to ironic
    effect, and seems to mean approximately the same thing as
    “circumstance”: “I laughed at time, since, although it has not
    borrowed evil from me, it repays me.” In the letter, “time” is
    an ambiguous figure. Friedrich Schulthess supposed that “time”
    in the letter was an expression of the Stoic concept of
    “fate,”<note place="foot" xml:id="FN54" n="54">

         </p>
                </note> I would argue
    that the philosophical generalities in the letter also weigh
    against a strict technical interpretation of the term. Cureton
    seems to see “time” as personified at some points in the letter
    (“the Time forbade us to complete those things;”<note place="foot" xml:id="FN56" n="56">

    men as are called to discipline seek to disentangle themselves
    from the struggle of the time;”<note place="foot" xml:id="FN58" n="58">
                    <p rend="footnote text">

         </p>
                </note>). The ambiguity is understandable, however, if
    the author of the letter is seeking to conform both to the
    personification in the chreia and to a more prosaic use of the
    word. The personification of “time” in the anecdote is
    striking, and could be put to good rhetorical effect, but would
    be difficult to sustain over an extended composition. The
    repeated use of the word “time” in the letter reflects the
    centrality of “time” in the chreia, but its ambiguity in the
    letter seems to be a result of the problems inherent in
    expanding a concise witticism into a serious treatise. Theon’s
    chreia of Epameinondas, quoted earlier, comes to mind: here the
    Theban general’s victories are personified as his daughters,
    but in the expanded chreia the victories are described in both
    everyday terms and in personified terms. The result is perhaps
    more labored than the original, with the change from “I have
    left two daughters—the victory at Leuctra and the one at
    Mantineia” to “Stop weeping friends, for I have left you two
    immortal daughters: two victories of our country over the
    Lacedaemonians, the one at Leuctra, who is the older, and the
    younger, who is just now being born at Mantineia.” Given the
    manner in which the writer of the <hi rend="italic">Letter of Mara bar
    Serapion</hi> follows other conventions of chreia elaboration,
    it is perhaps best to see the figure of time as ambiguous by
    virtue of the difficulty of chreia expansion rather than
    because of a complex philosophical agenda.</p>

            <anchor corresp="P16"/>[16] The
    presence of both friends and troubles is another obvious theme
    in the letter and chreia, and it is through examination of the
    “hardship” of Roman military action described in the letter
    that scholars have generally attempted to place the letter in a
    specific historical context.<note place="foot" xml:id="FN60" n="60">

                </note> Yet these examinations have been
    singularly inconclusive. The references in the letter to a
    Roman conquest of Samosata suggest, at first glance, three
    different possible contexts for the letter: the Roman takeover
    of Commagene in the late first century, the war between Rome
    and Parthia in the mid-second century, and the conflict between
    the emperor Valerian and the Persian Shapur I in the mid-third
    century. Unfortunately, the flight to Seleucia and the
    imprisonment of residents of Samosata described in the letter
    do not find corroboration in accounts of any of these three
    conflicts.<note place="foot" xml:id="FN61" n="61">

         </p>
                </note> Given the difficulty in
    matching the circumstances described in the letter to any known
    Roman conquest of Samosata, however, it is worth considering
    more seriously the possibility that the letter-writer is not
    describing actual events at first hand, or at all. The muddled
    description of Mara bar Serapion’s troubles could more easily
    have arisen from the clues given in the chreia, namely, that
    Mara is imprisoned with certain companions, and that the times
    are bad. The detail of Roman conquest would then be a
    rhetorical flourish based on the knowledge that the Romans had,
    at <hi rend="italic">some</hi> point in the past, conquered Samosata. The
    parallels with Theon’s “expanded” chreia are here apt: the
    student of rhetoric is to give the anecdote a lively historical
    setting, adding whatever details seem most plausible or vivid.
    Details of Mara bar Serapion’s capture by the Romans lend the
    letter both vividness and a certain pathos which the chreia
    itself lacks. Likewise Libanius’ elaboration of the Alexander
    chreia: the chreia is given a setting “historical enough” to
    tempt scholarly identification (Hock and O’Neil suggest
    Alexander’s victory at Gaugamela),<note place="foot" xml:id="FN63" n="63">

         <p>In comparison with Hock and O’Neil’s list of elements common
    to the chreia elaboration (encomium, paraphrase, philosophical
    rationale, argument from the opposite, analogy, example,
    testimony of the ancients, epilogue), the similarities are very

            <anchor corresp="P19"/>[19] The
    idea that the <hi rend="italic">Letter of Mara bar Serapion</hi> is deeply
    indebted to Greek rhetorical traditions, and may not reveal
    much as an eyewitness account of a Roman victory, has of course
    arisen in other work on the letter, although the work’s
    specific status as a chreia elaboration has not, until now,
    been explored.<note place="foot" xml:id="FN72" n="72">
                    <p rend="footnote text">
             F. Millar, <hi rend="italic">Roman Near East</hi>, 460–61,
    acknowledges that the letter is problematic but attempts to
    date it to the first century nonetheless, on the assumption
    that it is a product of the Roman victory at Commagene.
    
         </p>
                </note> McVey has argued that the letter conforms in
    many respects to stock philosophical writing in antiquity, and
    that extrapolating a concrete historical setting or context
    from the letter is difficult, not to say impossible. Specifying
    that the letter is a chreia elaboration would, I think, both
    reinforce and explain this difficulty: while it acknowledges
    that “Mara bar Serapion” may well have been a recognizable
    historical figure to the readers of the chreia, it gives modern
    readers no more actual historical information about him than
    Libanius’ elaboration of the Alexander chreia gives us about
    Alexander. McVey argues further that the writer of the letter
    can nonetheless be identified as a Christian writer of the
    fourth century, on the strength of two passages: one that
    apparently connects the dispersion of the Jews to the death of
    their “wise king,” and another that describes people as
    “casting out” their children, a passage that McVey takes to be
    a reference to (and condemnation of) the exposure of
    infants.<note place="foot" xml:id="FN73" n="73">

                </note> Her conclusion is that the writer is a
    Christian apologist posing as a pagan intellectual in order to
    support Christian supersessionist and moral claims. Here, too,
    however, the identification of the letter as a chreia
    elaboration should complicate the drawing of such
    straightforward conclusions from these two passages.</p>

            <anchor corresp="P20"/>[20] To
    take the second passage first, as the simpler case: the lines
    in question read as follows: “For I wondered at many who cast
    out their children, and I was amazed at others who bring up
    those who are not their own. There are men who acquire property
    in the world; and I also was amazed at the others who inherit
    what is not their own.”<note place="foot" xml:id="FN74" n="74">

         </p>
                </note> If we read the letter as a
    rhetorical exercise, it is easy to connect this passage to such
    texts as the <hi rend="italic">Controversiae</hi> of the Elder Seneca, in
    which children are frequently lost, kidnapped, disinherited, or
    otherwise misplaced through often spectacular turns of
    fortune.<note place="foot" xml:id="FN75" n="75">

         </p>
                </note> In a slightly more subdued Greek rhetorical
    context, the passage is reminiscent of another chreia
    attributed to Diogenes: “The Cynic philosopher Diogenes, when
    he saw an illegitimate child throwing stones, said, ‘Stop,
    child! You might hit your father without knowing it.”<note place="foot" xml:id="FN76" n="76">

                </note> The
    point is more about human ignorance and turns of fortune than
    simply about the ethics of stone-throwing. I would suggest that
    the passage in the <hi rend="italic">Letter of Mara bar Serapion</hi> takes
    up this trope, not to condemn child exposure per se, but as a
    comment on the unpredictability of human affairs and the
    resultant need for detachment. As the letter elsewhere
    suggests, “glory, that vanity that fills the life of men, do
    not reckon it among those things that make us happy: quickly it
    does us harm, especially in the birth of beloved sons.”<note place="foot" xml:id="FN77" n="77">

    hard to read this as an unmixed endorsement of child-rearing.
    The question of child exposure, then, taken in a rhetorical
    context, does not allow for a simple identification of the
    letter with any specifically Christian moral claims.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P21"/>[21] It
    is harder to interpret the passage about the dispersion of the
    Jews and about their “wise king.” This is partly because there
    is a crucial verb missing in the passage, and partly because,
    as we have seen, the genre of chreia elaboration tends to
    historicize in extremely vague ways. Again, it is worth quoting
    the passage in full; it occurs in the section of the letter
    that, following the conventions of chreia elaboration, combines
    exempla and “testimony of the ancients” to support its
    argument:</p>
         <quote>
      For what did the Athenians profit by the killing of Socrates?
      They received hunger and death in retribution for it. Or the
      people of Samos by the burning of Pythagoras? For in one hour
      their whole land was covered in sand. Or the Jews, of their
      wise king? For from that very time their kingdom was taken
      away. For God justly made retribution for the wisdom of these
      three, for the Athenians died hungry and the people of Samos
      were irreparably covered by the sea, and the Jews were
      destroyed and persecuted out of their kingdom, and are
      dispersed throughout every land. Socrates is not dead,
      because of Plato, nor Pythagoras, because of the statue of
      Hera, nor the wise king, because of the new laws that he
      established.<note place="foot" xml:id="FN78" n="78">

         <p>There is, unfortunately, no clarifying verb in the question,
    “Or the Jews, of their wise king?” It is reasonable to suppose

    like, “by the death [sc. of their wise king],” and in fact this

    the killing [sc. of their wise king]” here. It may be going too
    far to supply “by the rejection/crucifixion?,” as K. McVey does
    (“Fresh Look,” 264), especially since “crucifixion” would
    presumably remove all doubt that the “wise king” should be
    identified with Jesus, who is after all never named in the

                </note> but it is
    significant that Jesus is not actually named in the text, nor
    is the crucifixion specified. I do not mean to suggest that the
    writer here cannot have a Christian apologetic argument in
    mind, and I think it is more than reasonable to suppose that

            <anchor corresp="P22"/>[22] The
    vagueness of the reference is, however, important. Cureton
    suggests that it is due to the early date of the letter, and
    that the writer was prudently avoiding a mention of Jesus in
    order to remain safe during a period in which Christians were
    persecuted.<note place="foot" xml:id="FN82" n="82">

                </note> If the letter is a chreia elaboration,
    however, there is no need to suppose that the lack of
    specificity is so coherently motivated. As McVey notes, the
    reference to Pythagoras in the same passage is also
    problematic, in that the writer conflates Pythagoras the
    philosopher with Pythagoras the sculptor, also of Samos, who,
    according to Diogenes Laertius, lived at about the same
    time.<note place="foot" xml:id="FN83" n="83">

                </note> The appeal in both cases, then, is not
    necessarily to a Pythagoras or to a “wise king” the specific
    details of whose identity are vital to the argument. Rather,
    the appeal is to a more general “antiquity” populated by
    generic wise figures who are persecuted. To return, briefly, to
    Libanius’ elaboration of the chreia on Alexander and his
    friends, Libanius offers the examples of Orestes and Pylades
    and of Achilles and Patroclus as support for his argument that
    friends, are, indeed, treasures.<note place="foot" xml:id="FN84" n="84">

                </note> These examples tell us no
    more than that these legendary figures were recognizable as
    “friends” in Greek cultural discourse. They do not entail that
    Libanius endorsed a return to Homeric military or religious
    ideals. Indeed, despite his devotion to traditional Greek gods,
    it seems clear that Libanius did not, for example, follow
    Julian the Apostate in any extreme religious nostalgia.<note place="foot" xml:id="FN85" n="85">

                </note> It is
    plausible then that by the time the <hi rend="italic">Letter of Mara bar

    argument that the death of Jesus, or of a “wise king,” was the
    reason for the dispersal of the Jews was current in Syriac
    thought. This would support McVey’s contention that the letter
    may date from around the fourth century or later, when the
    argument is prominent in Syriac Christian sources. It does not,
    however, entail that the writer of the letter had a particular
    theological interest in promoting this argument. On the
    contrary, Bowersock’s work on the long period of coexistence
    between “paganism” and Christianity in Syria seems well
    supported by a letter that places Socrates, Pythagoras, and
    Jesus (or a wise Jewish king) in precisely the same group,
    namely, persecuted wise men.<note place="foot" xml:id="FN86" n="86">

                </note> If, as Bowersock has argued,
    Hellenism, Christianity and local cult could thrive in
    coexistence in Syria, it would be prudent to avoid the
    conclusion that any familiarity with Christian arguments
    implies a Christian affiliation. The composition of an
    originally Greek type of rhetorical exercise in Syriac should,
    instead, make clear the vast range of possibilities for
    cultural and narrative interchange in such a text. Rather than
    privileging one narrative over the others, it may be better to
    use this text to question the likelihood that cultural and
    religious affiliations were routinely seen as exclusive in the
    late ancient Near East.</p>

            <anchor corresp="P23"/>[23] The
    removal of the <hi rend="italic">Letter of Mara bar Serapion to his Son</hi>
    from a concrete historical context poses certain problems for
    the historian of Syrian-Roman relations in the first centuries
    CE. The letter’s placement in a far more traditional rhetorical
    context, however, opens up new possibilities for the study of
    early Syriac literature and the history of education in the
    provinces of the Roman Empire. Although the date of the letter,
    on this reading, remains elusive, the use of Greek and Roman
    rhetorical forms in Syriac prose composition suggests a high
    degree of cultural exchange between Syriac speakers and their
    imperial neighbors. Notably, the codex in which the <hi rend="italic">Letter
    of Mara bar Serapion</hi> is found also contains several
    translations of Greek philosophical and educational works,
    among them <hi rend="italic">sententiae</hi> of Menander, Isocrates’

    to Pythagoras, works of Aristotle, and Porphyry’s

             On the other hand, the number of Greek
    loan-words in the letter is small; the names of Greek literary
    and cultural figures are easily the most prominent. Brock
    argues for an increasing use of Greek loan-words as
    assimilation occurs, especially in translations (S. Brock,
    “From Antagonism,” 18; see also his “Aspects of Translation

    in a rhetorical exercise would have been considered “bad form,”
    as it often was in Latin and Greek practice. As Brock has
    elsewhere suggested, in some bilingual contexts Syriac would
    have been considered a language of greater literary prestige
    than Greek, which might also have inclined the author to avoid
    loan-words: S. Brock, “Greek and Syriac in Late Antique Syria,”

                </note> This prominence of Greek
    rhetoric and literary culture in the letter is even more
    clearly recognizable once the letter is properly understood to
    be a chreia elaboration.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P24"/>[24] The
    <hi rend="italic">Letter of Mara bar Serapion</hi> is thus a document of both
    limited and important historical use. While it tells us little
    about the political relationship between the Roman Empire and
    late ancient Syria, it nonetheless usefully illustrates the
    intersection of Greek literary forms and Syriac literary
    practice. The writer who posed as Mara bar Serapion for the
    purposes of this letter should alert students of Syriac
    literature and Christianity, not so much to the need for a
    philosophical outlook on life, as to the need to approach
    ancient Syria as an active participant in the culture of the
    broader Mediterranean world.</p>_______<lb/>

                <p xml:lang="en">The study of the Arabic version of the <hi rend="italic">Life of
                        John the Merciful</hi>, originally written in Greek by the Byzantine
                    hagiographer Leontios of Neapolis towards the middle of the 7<hi
                        rend="superscript">th</hi> century, offers the opportunity for an overall
                    reconsideration of the entire manuscript tradition of the work. The importance
                    of the Arabic <hi rend="italic">Life</hi> in the history of the transmission of
                    Leontios’ hagiography is primarily connected to its central position among the
                    oriental versions (including Syriac and Georgian), the Greek original, and the
                    medieval translations into Latin. This contribution aims to clarify the origin
                    of the Arabic version (from Greek or Syriac). It offers a definitive
                    clarification of the mutual relationship between the ancient translations of the
                        <hi rend="italic">Life of John the Merciful</hi>. After outlining the <hi
                        rend="italic">status quaestionis</hi> and the latest advancements on the
                    topic, the article will study the Arabic version from an ecdotic point of view.
                    By focusing on the most relevant <hi rend="italic">loci critici</hi> of the
                    work, the author will show the close connection between the Arabic, Syriac, and
                    Latin versions. Excluding their common dependence on a lost Greek <hi
                        rend="italic">Vorlage</hi>, the author will provide evidence of the direct
                    relationship between Arabic and Latin on the one hand, and between Syriac and
                    Arabic on the other. Finally, the Arabic text will be studied as an indirect
                    witness of the Syriac manuscript tradition by comparing it with the multiple
                    forms of the Syriac version.</p>

                        starting points for studying the Latin, Syriac, and Arabic versions.<note
                            place="foot" xml:id="ftn6" n="6"><p rend="footnote text"> Leontios’ work
                                circulated widely both in the Christian East and in the Latin West,
                                as is clear from the large number translations: three in Latin and
                                one each respectively in Syriac, Arabic, Georgian and Slavic, cf.
                                Déroche, <hi rend="italic">Études sur Léontios</hi>, p. 37-39.
                                Déroche considered the Syriac version to preserve an ancient form of
                                the Greek text: his theory was based on the analysis of Bedjan's
                                edition, which is extremely deficient from an ecdotic point of view,
                                especially in the part of the prologue which was examined by
                                Déroche, cf. Venturini<hi rend="italic">, Nuove considerazioni</hi>,
                                p. 78-79. In his work, Déroche clarifies the dependence of
                                Anastasius’ Latin translation on the “short version” of the Greek
                                text, and of the other two Latin translations on the “long version”,
                                Déroche, <hi rend="italic">Études sur Léontios</hi>, p. 73-75 and
                                42-43. Concerning the Arabic version, Déroche does not say whether
                                it derives from Greek or Syriac; he does, however, provide to the
                                reader with important data for a first approach to the text, cf. <hi

                        than the Greek text: it follows the Syriac (almost <hi rend="italic">ad
                            verbum</hi>) in its drastic reduction of rhetorical and descriptive
                        sections. In conclusion, Arabic and Syriac create a different narrative
                        fabric from the one conceived by Leontios of Neapolis. Nevertheless, the
                        Arabic version keeps one original detail of the Greek which is not present
                        in Syriac: the mention of orphans and widows, which could reveal a direct
                        knowledge of the Greek original. Binggeli concludes by formulating two
                        alternative hypotheses: a) Syriac and Arabic were translated from the same
                        lost Greek model; b) the Arabic version was translated from Syriac and
                        eventually revised according to the Greek original. To support the claim
                        that the Arabic translator knew the Greek original, Binggeli adduces the
                        colophon of Sinai Ar. 428, which informs that the <hi rend="italic">Life of
                            John the Merciful</hi> has been translated from Greek (<hi rend="italic"

                                specialist in Arabic language, I developed my research [workflow?]
                                as follows. First of all, I examined some Garshuni manuscripts,
                                easier to read, looking for the crucial <hi rend="italic">loci</hi>
                                of the Syriac version. I consulted two manuscripts, both late but
                                well conserved: Vatican Syr. 202, f. 1r-52v [1672 A. D.] and Dayr
                                Mar Mattay, ms. 138, f. 106r-122r [n. d.]. After this preliminary
                                phase, I studied the detected passages with Bishara Ebeid, my
                                colleague in Venice. After translating it, Bishara compared the
                                Garshuni text to that of the oldest Arabic manuscript, Sinai Ar.
                                428, to register the variants. In this way, we made sure that the
                                Garshuni manuscripts do not reflect a different version from that
                                preserved in the Sinaitic sources. After that, I transcribed the
                                selected passages from Vatican Syr. 202, registering the variants in
                                the footnotes. I am infinitely grateful to Bishara Ebeid for his
                                help, without which this contribution would have never seen the
                                light of day. The content of Vatican Syr. 202 has been descripted by

                        The chapters are arranged in the following order (reference is made to
                        Festugière’s numeration): 6 (1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> part)+47,

                                Arabic into Latin of a Christian hagiographic work is an unusual
                                event in the cultural history of the Latin Middle Ages. It is thus
                                very difficult to define the place and period of the translation:
                                the lexicon and the epoch of the manuscript suggest that we are
                                dealing with a late version. At chapter 22, the erroneous mention of
                                    <hi rend="italic">Satalia</hi> (the Crusaders’ city of Antalya)
                                instead of Sicily, refers to the context of the Crusades, whereas it
                                would be incomprehensible how such an error could have occurred in
                                Muslim Sicily. It should be remembered that even the Latin version
                                of John of Amalfi, which dates to 11<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>
                                century, reflects the direct relations with the East of the Latin
                                community to which that translation was addressed, cf. Greif, <hi
                                    rend="italic">La orden de San Juan en Jerusalén</hi>, p. 192 and
                                n. 26.</p></note>. One of the most eccentric features of this
                        version is the lexicon: common and proper names, some of which have a Latin
                        origin, are abnormally altered. A possible explanation for these
                        deformations is that they came into Latin through Arabic instead of Greek.

                        (“bringer of happiness”) is trivialized by α, whose compiler deduced the
                        meaning of “blessed” from the following verb <foreign xml:lang="syr"
                            >ܡܬܒܪܟ</foreign>, which translates the Greek εὐλογῆσαι. The original
                        translation had to seem unintelligible because of its extreme literality, to
                        the scribe who introduced the variant. Here again, the Arabic <hi

                        reproduces the error of α. It is also noteworthy the precise translation of

                        simplify the concept. Nevertheless, this passage reveals something else: α
                        does not say that God bestows the blessing, although this is explicit in
                        Greek, in β, and in Arabic.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn72" n="72"><p

                    <p xml:lang="en">We can explain in two different ways the presence of the
                        Greek’s original details in the Arabic version: a) the Arabic translator
                        also consulted the Greek text to improve his translation; b) the Arabic
                        version depends on an ancient form of the Syriac text, preserving an
                        intermediate stage between α and Σ. The first hypothesis is challenging to
                        demonstrate and refute because it involves a contamination, as the compiler
                        mixed two different sources. To verify the second hypothesis, we need a
                        passage that has undoubtedly been translated into Arabic from a Syriac model
                        of better quality than α, without the possible help of a Greek source. I
                        have found a sentence in the Arabic version that certainly reflects the
                        Syriac original, while the Greek text expresses the concept using different
                        words.</p>

                            >Story of Peter the Tax Collector</hi> (β); b) the recension π retains
                        only sporadic elements of Σ, but the great part of its text depends on α; c)
                        the Sinaitic fragment (S) preserves only two tiny excerpts of the work. The
                        intermediate position of the Arabic version between Σ and α is enough to
                        justify its knowledge of the Greek’s original details that disappeared in
                        the Syriac manuscript tradition, without involving any awareness of the
                        Greek original.</p>

                <p xml:lang="en">Considering the above-depicted <hi rend="italic">stemma</hi>, the
                    theory that the Arabic translation was revised on the Greek text appears no
                    longer necessary. Only the colophon of manuscript Sinai Ar. 428 supports the
                    idea that the Arabic translator somehow read the Greek original.<note

                            says that the <hi rend="italic">Life of John the Merciful</hi> has been
                            translated into Arabic directly from Greek, cf. <hi rend="italic"

                            even mention the translation from Syriac.</p></note> The information of
                    the colophon is clear but not necessarily accurate if not supported by textual
                    evidence of a direct transition from Greek into Arabic. The colophon could, for
                    example, simply betray the scribe’s awareness of the Byzantine origin of the <hi
                        rend="italic">Life of John the Merciful</hi>. In theory, it is not
                    impossible that the Arabic translator, despite having available a Syriac model
                    of excellent quality, decided <hi rend="italic">in addition</hi> to consult a
                    Greek manuscript to improve his translation further. Another compiler could have
                    also performed the revision on Greek many years after the first translation from
                    Syriac. In the following paragraphs, I will show that such a revision appears
                    unnecessary from an ecdotic point of view (5.1), and that it is not supported by
                    any clear textual evidence (5.2).</p>

                        (Σ) is known only from indirect witnesses (β and π). To support the theory
                        of a revision, all we can do is look for significative concordances between
                        Arabic and Greek against β or π. In this paragraph, I will start with the
                        examination of the latter case. The first passage where Arabic and Greek
                        agree against π is found at the very beginning of the work.</p>

                        reproduces better than α the original form of the prologue. As in the

                        the Greek which have been suppressed by π: the mention of the fathers “who

                        non-systematically, and mostly in case of necessity (for example, to fill
                        lacunas). On the other hand, the compiler of π radically abridged its model,
                        by cutting original details, sentences, and even entire episodes. Although
                        sometimes π it the only witness preserving the Greek’s original

                        a lower quality source than the Arabic text. Depending on an ancestor of α,
                        the Arabic version well preserves the author’s narrative scheme, which has
                        been destructured by π. Therefore, it is totally to be expected that several
                        passages of the Greek are better reproduced in Arabic than in Syriac. I will
                        enumerate here only a few of them.</p>

                            of the tale “in Africa”; the profession of Peter, “a tax collector”; the
                            temporal setting “in winter”; the poor people “warming up”; the blessing
                            on “the houses” of the merciful men; the literal reproduction of the
                            Greek εἰς μέσον, “in the middle”; the question whether a poor “had ever
                            received” from Peter (Syriac 2 and Arabic: “whether Peter had ever
                            given”); the deal of the poor with his companions; the basket carried by
                            the beast of burden.</item>
                        <item>When the Arabic version preserves an original detail of the Greek

                            no original details of the Greek, which are preserved exclusively by the

                        <item> Syriac 1 (β) does not specify that Peter was “very rich”. The Arabic
                            version retains this original detail but, here again, is not the only
                            one, as Syriac 2 (α) retains it too.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn91"

                                    expected in Syriac 1 (β), as it is not itself the original
                                    Syriac text (Σ), but just a copy of chapter 20 belonging to an
                                    independent branch of the manuscript tradition. I have found in
                                    Syriac 2 (α) other two original readings, cf. Venturini, <hi

                                    those passages literally.</p></note></item>
                        <item>Syriac 2 (α) and Arabic say that the poor’s companions “promised to
                            give him something”, while the Greek text says that they made “a deal
                            with him”. It is noteworthy that Syriac 1 (β) presents a halfway form of
                            the sentence: “after making a deal with him | on what they would have
                            given him”. The concept, which in Greek is not so explicit, has been
                            clarified by the Syriac translator, who added the second part of the
                            sentence. The first part of the sentence has been later simplified into
                            “they promised” by the common ancestor to Arabic and Syriac 2

                            process of the original, changing the expression in “with a good

                            of the Syriac text did not affect the Syriac model of the Arabic

                            suffered some of the omissions that we find also in Syriac 2 (α): the
                            loss of the main verb which introduces the episode (Gr.: Συνέβη, “it
                            happened”); the sentence “after thinking that he was a poor”, which is
                            essential for the comprehension of the whole passage (the sailor felt
                            ashamed and refused the expensive garment, but Peter did not understand
                            why, thinking that he was a poor asking for alms). Everything claims for
                            a progressive corruption of the Syriac translation. The Arabic version
                            reflects a precise stage of this corruption process, which is halfway
                            between Syriac 1 (β) and Syriac 2 (α).</item>

                    <p xml:lang="en">In this last passage, coming from the conclusion of the tale,
                        the Syriac translator readapted the Greek text, by adding the detail of the
                        mouth touched by the flame. Here the Arabic text and Syriac 1 (β) are almost
                        identical, while Syriac 2 (α) inverts the terms (“my mouth and my ears”) and
                        substitutes the substantive <foreign xml:lang="syr">ܫܠܗܒܝܬܐ</foreign>,
                        “flame” (surely original, cf. Gr.: <foreign xml:lang="gr">φλόγα</foreign>),
                        with <foreign xml:lang="syr">ܠܫܢܐ</foreign>, “tongue”. The perfect
                        concordance of the Arabic with Syriac 1 (β), against Syriac 2 (α) on one
                        hand, and against the Greek on the other, shows once more that the model of
                        the Arabic translator was not the Greek original, but a Syriac manuscript
                        belonging to a high branch of the tradition.</p>
                    <p xml:lang="en">To answer to the previous questions:</p>
                    <list rend="numbered">
                        <item>Syriac 1 (β) preserves original details of the Greek, which have
                            disappeared in Syriac 2 (α), better than the Arabic version does. There
                            is a first group of omissions and errors which is exclusive of Syriac 2
                            (α), whereas Arabic and Syriac 1 (β) faithfully reproduce the Greek.
                            There is then a second group of variants, which are common to Syriac 2
                            (α) and Arabic, whereas only Syriac 1 (β) correctly reflects the
                            Greek.</item>
                        <item>I did not find any passage which is correctly reproduced only by the
                            Arabic version, against Syriac 1 (β) and Syriac 2 (α). Quite the
                            opposite, the Arabic version usually agrees with Syriac 2 (α), against
                            Syriac 1 (β) and the Greek. Finally, it also happens that Arabic agrees
                            only with Syriac 1 (β), against the Greek.</item>
                        <item>It is sometimes possible to retrace the progressive development of the
                            variants. The Greek text is often readapted by the Syriac translator,
                            introducing some extensions and clarifications. Sometimes the Arabic
                            version has lost the main features of the original, preserving only
                            those extensions. Syriac 2 (α) often goes further on in this
                            deterioration process.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p xml:lang="en">None of these observations is compatible with a revision on the
                        Greek original performed by the Arabic translator. It would be challenging
                        to justify how the outcome of such a revision is often identical to Syriac 1
                        (β). If the Arabic translator had consulted a Greek source, the improvements
                        of the Arabic text would be different from those of Syriac 1 (β). To support
                        the theory of a “re-translation” from Greek, it is not enough to find
                        details of the Greek original or calques from Greek words, which the Arabic
                        may have derived from a Syriac source of high quality.<note place="foot"

                            to that of the Arabic version, where the three chapters are lacking, cf.

                    unknown not only to the Arabic translator but also to the anonymous author of
                    the Latin version BHL 4392, who translated from an Arabic source.</p>

                    <item>The Greek’s original details, reproduced by the Arabic version, are not
                        the outcome of direct knowledge of the Greek text but of a high branch of

                    <item>The Syriac recension β reproduces the Greek text much better than the
                        Arabic version.</item>
                    <item>The absence in Arabic (and in Latin) of the “doctrinal chapters” is the

                </list>
                <p xml:lang="en">The position of the Arabic version in the manuscript tradition of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Life of John the Merciful</hi> is crucial, not only from
                    the stemmatic point of view but more in general from that of the “transmission’s
                    history”. The Arabic version unexpectedly performs the role of cultural mediator
                    between the “oriental redaction” of the <hi rend="italic">Life</hi> and the
                    Latin West. From an ecdotic perspective, the Arabic version represents the
                    “missing link” among the multiple recensions of the Syriac text. The study in
                    parallel of both translations can not only clarify their mutual relationship but
                    also provide new evidence for the research on the Syriac manuscript tradition.
                    As a meeting point between the Syriac, Latin, and Georgian traditions, the
                    Arabic version can help solve some problems that trouble the text’s history. The
                    Arabic text can directly improve not only the edition of the Syriac version but
                    also that of the Greek original. For example, it can help to choose between <hi
                        rend="italic">adiaphora</hi> in the Greek manuscripts, where the Syriac
                    tradition does not reproduce a specific passage. For these reasons, a critical
                    edition of this version represents, more than before, a <hi rend="italic"
                        >desideratum</hi>. I hope that someone will be interested in working on this
                    challenging task, which is expected to bring new knowledge about a manuscript
                    tradition that never stops to surprise.</p>

         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P1"/>[1] Students
    and teachers of Greek and Latin have long had a wide array of
    tools to assist them in learning the languages and literatures
    of their area of study. Original language texts with notes,
    vocabularies and commentary abound and are pitched at every
    level of expertise from the beginner to the professional
    scholar. Students of Biblical Hebrew and New Testament Greek
    have many helps in their tasks, as well, in the form of
    vocabularies and readers, though their field still is more
    likely to expect its students to be involved in professional
    training and so does not offer the same array of help on varied
    levels. How far from this has been the plight of the student of
    Syriac!</p>
         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P2"/>[2] In
    response to this gap in the materials for the study of Syriac,
    Sebastian Brock and George Kiraz have published a volume that
    offers students of Syriac language and literature (and their
    teachers) an entry into the study of the poetry of St. Ephrem
    the Syrian as well as a doorway into the whole exciting field
    of Syriac Studies.</p>
         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P3"/>[3] The
    volume contains a brief introduction offering an overview of
    St. Ephrem's life and work, the transmission of his texts and
    the meters in which they are composed. Then follow 20 texts,
    facing an English translation, drawn from 11 of the collections
    in which the works come down to us. The texts are ordered
    "according to the outline of Ephrem's concept of salvation
    history", which allows the volume to teach its readers another
    important fact about Ephrem: that his many and varied works
    were all pieces in a delicately drawn picture of reality that
    is not always in step with our own. Cautious instructors will
    be glad that this choice of a theological ordering will enable
    them to avoid long and confusing discussions of different
    modern schemes of dating Ephrem's works and students will
    benefit by the push to think of Ephrem's words as he would have
    done. Appendices that contain a listing of the main editions
    and English translations of Ephrem's works, an index of the
    <hi rend="italic">Qale</hi> according to which the poems are composed and an
    index of Scripture citations in the texts add greatly to the
    usefulness of the volume for the private owner.</p>
         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P4"/>[4] Each of
    the 20 texts is prefaced by an introduction that helps to
    situate it in Ephrem's over-all pattern of thought, discusses
    its particular meter and offers information on where it
    survives in manuscript collections. Scriptural citations and
    allusions are noted in the margin of the translation page and
    occasional footnotes discuss obscure points and situate the
    reader in Ephrem's large corpus by drawing connections that
    only very wide knowledge of Ephrem's work allows. An added
    voice comes from Andrew Palmer, who has offered a number of
    contributions to the notes that are marked with his
    initials.</p>
         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P5"/>[5] Many
    students of Semitic languages who have also worked in Latin and
    Greek find it difficult to appreciate the reluctance of Semitic
    scholars to publish critical texts. The long custom of reading
    the margins and the apparatus at the foot of the page along
    with the base text seems one that could well be dispensed with.
    This volume takes a step in that direction by moving the
    authors' suggested readings into the main text. This makes the
    experience of struggling through the text much more encouraging
    for the student. The words he labors to read actually make
    sense and can be construed successfully. Every beginning
    student in Semitics knows the bitter moment of realization that
    one has forgotten to replace a corrupted reading with one drawn
    from a better text and hidden in the apparatus, out of sight
    and out of mind. That may become less frequent if this volume's
    example is more widely followed.</p>
         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P6"/>[6] What
    does this volume offer an instructor in search of a text for a
    class in Syriac or a student looking for something to read to
    polish his Syriac skills? The Syriac text is printed in a
    beautiful, cleanly designed <hi rend="italic">serto</hi> script that has been
    fully vocalized. The lines are well laid out on the pages with
    ample space between them, an encouragement to reading aloud or
    study. These practical details make using this volume an
    exercise in language study for the student rather than a
    drudgery of deciphering smeared and cramped lettering. The
    translation tracks with the Syriac line by line, so each pair
    of pages can be viewed on its own. The notes, which are not
    found on every page, offer a variety of kinds of help. Some
    seem designed to aid in teaching critical reading. Note 5 on
    page 227, attached to stanza 2 of the first of the <hi rend="italic">Carmina
    Nisibena</hi>, is an excellent example. The translation offered
    on the page above is "the deadly flood". The note offers five
    other possibilities, including two different emendations. An
    energetic instructor could use this note to devote a good
    portion of a class meeting to approaches to analyzing the text
    one sees on the page and how to draw meaning from an idiom very
    different from modern English.</p>
         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P7"/>[7] The
    primary task of those teaching Syriac studies (as opposed to
    those pursuing research in the field) is always to draw more
    students into the area by showing them how fascinating and
    rewarding it can be. Drs. Brock and Kiraz offer support to that
    endeavor in more than one way. This volume allows for an
    engagement with the original text of a great early Syrian
    theologian and poet. It helps the reader gain a sense of
    Ephrem's theological vision of the rise of sin and working out
    of salvation in the world. It demonstrates Ephrem's use of
    Scripture in his writing. An interested reader, innocent of
    Syriac, who read the English pages of the book from beginning
    to end would learn a great deal of theology, some history and
    gain a sense of a new voice from the Christian past. I think
    that groups of interested lay Christians could make very
    successful use of this collection as a selection for their
    Bible Study or book groups. Individual hymns could certainly be
    drawn into discussions based outside Syriac Studies. I think
    this book should be on the shelf of every student of Syriac,
    but also in parish libraries, as well as college and university
    collections.</p>
         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P8"/>[8] I cannot
    close without noting, as someone who has been involved in both
    proof-reading and printing books, that this is an astonishingly
    elegant and attractive book. I discovered no misprints at all
    in the course of reading it with quite close attention. Only
    experience can reveal the amount of effort required to produce
    such a fine result. I hope that this will be the first of many
    similar volumes to issue from the Brigham Young University
    Press.</p>

            <anchor xml:id="P1"/>[1] David
    Lane was born in 1935, in Huddersfield, Yorkshire, into a
    family in which grandparents, parents, aunts, and uncle were
    all school-teachers. Wartime and family circumstances led him
    to being educated at 9 different schools before going to
    Hurstpierpoint College, a Church of England boarding school for
    �the middle class�, where a vocation to the priesthood was
    identified and nurtured. After two years� army service with the
    Royal Signals, which took him to Egypt for a year, he went to
    Magdalen College, Oxford, to read Theology. Encouraged by one
    of Britain�s leading Hebrew scholars, Sir Godfrey Driver, he
    went on to read a second undergraduate degree, Oriental Studies
    (Hebrew with Aramaic and Syriac). He learned Syriac under L.H.
    Brockington, the reviser of the much-used Robinson�s <hi rend="italic">Syriac
    Grammar</hi>. Of great value for his work in New Testament and
    Syriac was being introduced to <hi rend="italic">Mishnah</hi> and Jewish
    medieval commentaries by Dr. David Patterson, later the founder
    and Director of Oxford�s Centre for Hebrew Post-Biblical
    Studies.</p>
         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P2"/>[2] From
    there he went as a student for priesthood to the College of the
    Resurrection, Mirfield (just a few miles from his birthplace).
    While there he won, by examination, the Oxford University
    Hall-Houghton Syriac Prize. Instead of completing a second year
    at Mirfield, he was asked by the Community of the Resurrection
    to go to their seminary, Codrington College, Barbados, West
    Indies. There he found himself teaching New Testament and
    Greek, and later being Director of Studies. He was made a
    deacon in Barbados, May 1962, and ordained priest in December
    that year.</p>
         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P3"/>[3] In 1965
    he returned to the UK, and for a year was assistant priest in a
    parish in Oxford. Then he went to Pembroke College Oxford as
    Associate Chaplain, and was awarded the Kennicott Hebrew
    Fellowship. This enabled him to begin work on the Peshitta of
    the Old Testament, again with encouragement of Sir Godfrey
    Driver. It also began a very fruitful association with the
    Peshitta Institute in Leiden, then directed by Professor P.A.H.
    de Boer. Incidentally while at Pembroke he had the chance of
    teaching Syriac to a slim young Indian, Deacon George, who
    stayed with the Cowley Fathers. That Deacon George is now
    Geevarghese Mar Ivanios.�1967 saw Lane as a tutor at St.
    Stephen�s House, an Anglican seminary in Oxford, where he
    continued University teaching in elementary Hebrew, tutored
    theology students from many colleges, and continued work on
    Peshitta <hi rend="italic">Qoheleth</hi>. He retained a connection with
    Pembroke College as its Lecturer in Theology.</p>
         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P4"/>[4] In 1971
    Lane was invited to go as an Assistant Professor in Near
    Eastern Studies in the University of Toronto. This began a
    major period of Syriac activity: for the Leiden Peshitta
    <hi rend="italic">Qoheleth</hi> had been finished, and a revision of John
    Emerton�s <hi rend="italic">Wisdom of Solomon</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Song of Songs</hi>
    followed, to be joined by work on <hi rend="italic">Leviticus.</hi> For two
    summers he was a Visiting Professor at the Peshitta Institute,
    assisting with the edition of Genesis and Exodus, and with
    <hi rend="italic">I and II Kings</hi>. <hi rend="italic">The Leviticus</hi> work produced
    the Leiden Peshitta edition of that book, and a monograph which
    took Peshitta studies out of simple text criticism of the Old
    Testament into the wider field Syriac church history and
    liturgy, suggesting the theme of the second Leiden Peshitta
    Symposium, �<hi rend="italic">The Peshitta as Translation</hi>�. His
    published work to this point enabled Oxford University to award
    him the degree of Bachelor of Divinity: in Oxford this degree
    (based on publications) is of a higher standard than, and
    senior to, a D.Phil. In 1976 came his first participation in
    the <hi rend="italic">Symposium Syriacum</hi>at Chantilly, also Dr. Jacob�
    Thekeparampil�s first, though it was at the 1980 Symposium at
    Goslar that they first properly met. At Goslar, too, he was
    among the group of Syriac scholars whom the Indian bishops
    approached with the idea of SEERI.</p>
         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P5"/>[5] Although
    a tenured Associate Professor, in 1983 Lane accepted an
    invitation to join the staff of his old seminary, the College
    of the Resurrection. There he became Director of Studies, then
    Vice-Principal, and in 1990 Principal. He was also an Honorary
    Lecturer in Old Testament at the University of Leeds. With the
    encouragement of the Community of the Resurrection, of which he
    is an Oblate member, he completed his work on the Peshitta, and
    then began work on Syriac Fathers, especially
    <hi rend="italic">Shubbalmaran</hi>, 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> century metropolitan of
    Kirkuk. Participation in the European <hi rend="italic">Symposia</hi>
    continued, and from 1990 participation in the SEERI
    <hi rend="italic">Symposia</hi> also. Articles and book reviews were asked
    for and produced, but the most important Syriac activity was
    his increasing involvement with SEERI when its Director invited
    him to come as a guest Professor for the Syriac MA classes
    recently begun at SEERI under the aegis of Mahatma Gandhi
    University.</p>
         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P6"/>[6] In fact,
    since retirement from the College of the Resurrection in 1997
    Lane�s whole time has been given to Syriac affairs, so that
    this, his 70<hi rend="sup">th</hi> year, sees the publication in
    <hi rend="italic">Corpus Scriptorum Christianorum Orientalium (CSCO)</hi> of
    the two volumes (Syriac text and English version) of
    Shubhalmaran�s <hi rend="italic">Book of Gifts</hi>, a notable addition to
    the range of Syriac ascetic writings currently available. More
    recently there has been work on Jacob of Sarug�s verse
    homilies. However, through the years there has been time for
    priestly activity in the way of taking services and preaching,
    and for associations with parishes in Toronto and Cambridge.
    There has also been some little time for interests in railways
    and gardening: his photographs of British steam railways have
    appeared in journals and in books on railway history; literary
    interests led him to be President of the Sir Walter Scott Club
    of Toronto. He is currently on both the local and national
    committees of the Scottish Rock Garden Club, with a special
    interest in the alpine crevice plants known as
    <hi rend="italic">auriculas</hi> their leaves are like the little ears of
    bears. They are small and beautiful in detail, and bred by
    humans: appropriate for someone whose early interest was in
    textual variants and the taxonomy of manuscripts.</p>

    Responding to a perceived one-sided <hi rend="italic">rapprochement</hi>
    between Eastern Orthodox and Oriental Orthodox churches at the
    expense of the Assyrian Church of the East, which took place at
    Chamb�sy, Switzerland, in 1990, Wolfgang Hage repeatedly has
    called attention to the timely relevance of Gregory Barhebraeus
    (A.D. 1226-1286).<ref target="#FN1">1</ref> One may agree with him that this universally
    respected and appreciated leader of the Syrian Orthodox church
    is to be considered as an early model of how one may
    respectfully engage in dialogue with representatives of other
    Christian denominations, in Barhebraeus�s case both the
    �Chalcedonians� and the so-called �Nestorians,� without
    condemning either of the two as heretics. Just prior to the
    publication of the book here under review, Karl Pingg�ra
    explored in outline the historical development of Barhebraeus�s
    Christology by focusing on three texts: a) Barhebraeus�s
    treatise <hi rend="italic">On the Incarnation</hi>, which constitutes the
    fourth treatise of his main speculative theological work, the
    <hi rend="italic">Candelabra of the Sanctuary</hi>, as well as b)
    Barhebraeus�s <hi rend="italic">Letter to the Catholicos of the Church of the
    East, Mar Den<hi rend="u">h</hi>ā I</hi>, who held office
    from 1265 to 1281, and c) chapter four of the more spiritually
    and mystically oriented <hi rend="italic">Book of the Dove</hi>.<ref target="#FN2">2</ref> It is to
    be warmly welcomed that with Dr. Mathunny John Panicker, a
    member of the Malankara Orthodox Church who now teaches at the
    seminary in Kottayam, one of Barhebraeus�s own spiritual
    descendents engages this same line of ecumenically motivated
    inquiry into thirteenth-century Christology.</p>
         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P2"/>[2]
    Panicker�s study, a dissertation accepted at the Pontifical
    Oriental Institute in Rome, situates Barhebraeus�s life and
    work against the political and religious background of Muslim,
    Byzantine, Crusader, and Mongol conquests and interactions from
    the tenth to the thirteenth centuries on the one hand and
    ecclesiastical developments within the Syrian Orthodox church
    at the time on the other. In some places the reader may come to
    conclusions that differ from those Panicker reached regarding
    individual aspects of Barhebraeus�s biography. A case for
    Barhebraeus�s Jewish origins, for example, made on the basis of
    his father�s name, Aaron, combined with the information
    provided in the Karshuni inscription over his gravesite in the
    monastery of Mar Mattai, where Gregory and his brother Barsauma
    are identified as �children of Hebrew? (Ebro ?)� (p. 29, fn.
    55) may be judged as stronger than the case made for deriving
    Barhebraeus�s name from the adjective <hi rend="italic">�ebrāyā</hi>, a word
    itself derived from the noun <hi rend="italic">�ebrā</hi> (�seashore,�
    �crossing�) (see p. 29). Likewise, Panicker�s dismissal of
    Budge�s suggestion that Barhebraeus�s mother may have been of
    Arab extraction (pp. 29-30) appears to rest solely on a
    presumed equation of Arab with Muslim and neglects the equally
    likely alternative identification of Arab with Christian; that
    this is not Panicker�s thought throughout his work becomes
    clear from p. 207. This reviewer nevertheless appreciates
    Panicker�s generally ample documentation for and presentation
    of disagreeing positions, which allow one actively to engage
    the material and formulate one�s own conclusions in the
    process. Panicker concludes his first chapter by providing a
    helpful and sufficiently detailed classification and brief
    description of Barhebraeus�s written works. The categories of
    exegesis, liturgy, theology, philosophy, canon law, history,
    grammar, science (mathematics, astronomy, and medicine), and
    poetical and literary productions show Barhebraeus as a man of
    truly renaissance-style expertise.</p>
         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P3"/>[3] In
    chapter two, Panicker discusses Barhebraeus�s general
    methodology which he uses throughout his work and thus also
    when presenting his Christological thought. The spectrum of
    Barhebraeus�s sources is remarkable, ranging from Scripture,
    the Church Fathers, and synodal acts and canons, to historical
    works, texts by pagan philosophers, and works of Islamic
    authors, primarily the eleventh-century al-Ghazali, to whom
    Barhebraeus is indebted in his later, more mystical works, and
    the twelfth- and early thirteenth-century Fakhr ad-Din ar-Razi,
    to whom Barhebraeus refers in his treatise <hi rend="italic">On the
    Incarnation</hi>. Key to Barhebraeus�s methodological approach
    to Christology, as Panicker highlights, is that although the
    author is �convinced that his own christological formula is the
    orthodox one� (p. 49), in his list of the thirty �very
    dangerous heresies� at the end of the treatise <hi rend="italic">On the
    Incarnation</hi>, he does not include the �Chalcedonians and
    Nestorians.� Rather, these two groups belong for Barhebraeus to
    those who �only dispute over the definition of the union (in
    Christ), because all of them agree in the doctrines of [the]
    Trinity and of the preservation of the natures out of which
    Christ was made, without change and mixture� (pp. 49-50;
    modified; see also p. 206). In his discussion of Barhebraeus�s
    methodology, Panicker, moreover, emphasizes that Barhebraeus
    submitted himself to a principle of selection of prooftexts
    from patristic authors that was in accord with this
    conciliatory spirit. Thus, Barhebraeus did not �cite a Father
    as an authority to confirm his position against those who do
    not accept him as their Church Father� (p. 55). Cyril of
    Alexandria, for example, is only cited against Chalcedonians,
    but not against members of the Church of the East, as Panicker
    points out. Likewise, Barhebraeus also applied that same
    principle in situations of interreligious relevance. Views of
    Jews or Muslims that challenged the possibility of the
    incarnation are not countered by citations from church fathers,
    given that these authorities are not accepted by the respective
    dialogue partners. Panicker argues for Barhebraeus�s
    originality on the basis of the thirteenth-century author�s
    conscientious and astute handling of the patristic evidence.
    The ecumenical and interreligious dimensions of Barhebraeus�s
    approach seem equally illustrative of his religious and
    political sensitivity and invite further investigation.</p>
         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P4"/>[4] In
    chapters three and four (pp. 65-170) Panicker paraphrases and
    summarizes the argument of the treatise <hi rend="italic">On the
    Incarnation</hi>. The main concern of chapter three of
    Panicker�s study is the question of the possibility of the
    incarnation. Presenting in its first half the positions of
    ancient christological heretics, including the lesser known
    Nepos the Egyptian (p. 75) and �Oudi of Edessa� (p. 78), the
    second half of chapter three rephrases Barhebraeus�s response
    to objections raised against the incarnation on the basis of
    rational arguments (pp. 85-95), as well as those raised by Jews
    (pp. 95-101) and by Muslims (pp. 101-120).</p>
         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P5"/>[5] Chapter
    four focuses on the question of the mode of unity of the
    natures in Christ. Its first part consists of an exposition of
    the range of terms (<hi rend="italic">ousia, ithutho, iyo, kyono, qnumo,
    parsupho, yuqne, tuphso, methbarnshonutho, methbasronutho,
    ihidoyutho,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">naqiphutho</hi>) and their definitions
    that are crucial to how Barhebraeus formulated his Christology
    (pp. 121-131). This discussion as such is helpful and to be
    welcomed. Yet unfortunate misspellings (missing �t� in �sought�
    [p. 121]; �word� instead of �world� [p. 125, fn. 430];
    �Shemeon� instead of �Senoun� [p. 129]) as well as imprecise or
    awkward expressions (�Ousia is a Greek word, which is used in
    Syriac either <hi rend="italic">ousia</hi> or <hi rend="italic">ithutho</hi> to correspond
    to it.� [p. 122]), that were not removed from the study or
    corrected before publication, have the effect of distracting
    the reader�s attention through a displayed lack of precision
    and attention to details, so necessary in foundational sections
    like this one.</p>
         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P6"/>[6] The
    second, main part of chapter four is divided into three
    sections in which Panicker lays out how Barhebraeus responded
    to objections raised by Dyophysites (not �Duophysites� [p.
    131]) (pp. 131-153), Eutychians (pp. 153-158), and the
    followers of Julian of Halicarnassus (pp. 158-169). The length
    of the discussion devoted to those two last parties over and
    against which �Chalcedonians and Nestorians� can agree with
    Barhebraeus reveals that the author of the treatise <hi rend="italic">On the
    Incarnation</hi> had an interest in finding and defining common
    ground between himself and those whom he did not identify as
    heretics, the �Chalcedonians and Nestorians,� by characterising
    their shared opponents. This reviewer also notes especially the
    continued relevance and broad scope of the question of
    Theopaschism discussed between Chalcedonians and Syrian
    Orthodox Christians in the thirteenth century (pp. 149-152),
    given that already during the time of the immediate aftermath
    of Chalcedon in the context of Syria-Palestine this question
    appears to have played not the only but a decisively
    contributing role in the self-definition of anti-Chalcedonian
    identity.</p>
         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P7"/>[7] Both in
    chapter three and in chapter four Panicker helpfully embeds
    quotations of key passages in his discussion. While the range
    of church fathers, whom Panicker references in explanations in
    his footnotes, includes the classical Greek patristic
    authorities like Cyril of Alexandria, Gregory Nazianzen, and
    others, not surprisingly the two most audible voices are those
    of Severus of Antioch and Philoxenus of Mabbugh, the first only
    slightly outweighing the latter. A short discussion of this
    selectivity could helpfully have been included in the
    study.</p>
         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P8"/>[8] Chapter
    five consists of a systematic presentation of Barhebraeus�s
    Christology. This section also includes the presentation of
    Christological statements from Barhebraeus�s biblical
    commentaries (pp. 113, and 185-191). In his conclusions,
    Panicker accepts, though with some hesitance, the designation
    �diplophysitism� (not �diplophysetism�; p. 203) as the
    appropriate description of the characteristic feature of
    Barhebraeus�s Christology. This term, as Panicker acknowledges,
    was introduced into the discussion by Hage in 1991 (see Hage,
    �Ecumenical Aspects,� 106). Panicker sees that for Barhebraeus
    �Jesus Christ is one double nature.� That Barhebraeus�s
    expression here differs from Severus of Antioch�s ύπόστασις
    σύνθετος,<ref target="#FN3">3</ref> is a point which Panicker does not develop. In
    his conclusions, Panicker also accepts �miaphysite� as a
    fitting term to characterize Barhebraeus�s position (p. 207,
    fn. 739).</p>
         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P9"/>[9] In his
    general conclusions following chapter five (pp. 205-212),
    Panicker highlights especially the harmonious relations between
    Barhebraeus and the respective incumbents of the office of
    Catholicos of the Church of the East, as well as the respect in
    which Barhebraeus was held by Muslims. For Panicker,
    Barhebraeus lived out the ideal of ecumenism by holding on to
    the right belief of his own church and at the same time
    reaching out and communicating across the boundaries of
    denominations. Using the formula of the �one incarnate nature
    of God the Word,� Barhebraeus admitted, as Panicker sees it,
    that this �formula was not enough to conserve the faith in its
    fulness� (p. 208). He held on to it, since he thought it was
    better than what others had to offer. Nevertheless, he worked
    on the assumption that all three groups, Chalcedonians,
    Oriental Orthodox, and the Church of the East, professed the
    same truth of the faith in Jesus Christ. Thus, according to
    Panicker, Barhebraeus�s example forcefully mandates to
    establish �an immediate dialogue in Christian charity,
    patience, and openmindedness� (p. 211; modified) also with the
    Church of the East on the basis of the shared common faith in
    Christ.</p>
         <p rend="nn">
            <anchor xml:id="P10"/>[10] It
    is praiseworthy that Panicker�s work provides the
    English-speaking scholarly audience with convenient access to
    Barhebraeus�s Christological thinking, at least in its earlier
    phase, before the thirteenth-century theologian became Maphrian
    of the East,<ref target="#FN4">4</ref> or at most during his first year in office
    (Panicker, <hi rend="italic">The Person of Jesus Christ</hi>, 37). Yet one
    has to bemoan problems of accuracy in the use of language, even
    problems with basic grammar (e.g., subject-verb agreement
    [numerous times, e.g., p. 22]; hypercoristic grammatical forms
    [�slained� instead of �slain�; p. 37]; confusing punctuation;
    tenses; misuse of or omission of necessary prepositions; etc.)
    and expression (see example cited above, to which others, e.g.,
    on p. 207, could be added), which are almost to be expected in
    a work composed in English by a non-native speaker of English,
    under the direction of non-native speakers of English in Italy,
    and published under the direction of non-native speakers of
    English in a publishing house in Germany. Unless copy-editing
    of such works is entrusted to the hands of language
    professionals or native speakers, improvement of the linguistic
    quality of such works, which immediately influences their
    effectiveness of communication among an English-speaking
    audience, is not achievable. While being aware of the
    increasing costs of producing books in the field of Christian
    Oriental studies, this reviewer suggests a) that this question
    should be taken seriously in order to improve the quality and
    presentation of research results in the field of Christian
    Oriental studies, and b) to foster closer international
    collaborations between native and non-native English-speaking
    scholars in the field, whatever their level of documented
    achievement may be, who may be willing and open to proofread a
    work before it goes to print. These comments are not meant to
    suggest that the author of a given work does not also share the
    burden of responsibility for accuracy of his own work. In the
    present case, simple typographical errors (e.g., �Angles�
    instead of �Angels� [p. 36], or the homophonic confusion
    exemplified by �inhabitance� instead of �inhabitants� [p. 23,
    fn. 10]), can be caught by the eye of the attentive reader,
    native or non-native speaker. Also note that the abbreviation
    �CHABOT, �Deux textes�� (e.g., pp. 110, 111, 117-119 and in the
    bibliography) is misleading and should read �NAU, �Deux
    textes.��</p>
         <p rend="nn">
            <anchor xml:id="P11"/>[11]
    Moreover, it is necessary to comment on the scope of discussion
    of the subject matter presented in the book. The title of
    Panicker�s study leads one to expect a comprehensive and
    exhaustive treatment of Barhebraeus�s Christology. Yet although
    the author collects and summarily evaluates Christological
    statements also from Barhebraeus�s biblical commentaries, the
    clear focus and perspective of the analysis of Barhebraeus�s
    Christology is determined by material gathered from the
    thirteen-century theologian�s early work, the <hi rend="italic">Candelabra of
    the Sanctuary</hi>. This, moreover, entails that Barhebraeus�s
    explicit conviction of the superiority of his doctrinal
    position, which shaped his thinking during those early years
    more so than later on, constitutes the basis for Panicker�s
    presentation, despite all references to ecumenical efforts.
    These two structural and systematic limitations of Panicker�s
    study prevent the book under review from being comprehensive
    and exhaustive in its treatment of the subject matter.</p>
         <p rend="nn">
            <anchor xml:id="P12"/>[12]
    Panicker refers merely in passing to the <hi rend="italic">Letter to
    Catholicos Den<hi rend="u">h</hi>ā</hi> (pp. 45 and 206).
    He notes that this letter is �[a] christological and historical
    treatise� (p. 45). Yet his study never explores the
    Christological content of this work any further, thus lacking
    in comprehensiveness at least in this instance. Pingg�ra�s
    discussion of the <hi rend="italic">Letter to Catholicos Den<hi rend="u">h</hi>ā</hi>, on the other hand, has suggested and
    convincingly demonstrated that there is a connection between a
    group�s theological, even Christological, identity, and that
    same group�s view of church history. While Barhebraeus�s main
    Christological statements in the <hi rend="italic">Letter to Catholicos
    Den<hi rend="u">h</hi>ā</hi> do not differ from those in
    the <hi rend="italic">Candelabra of the Sanctuary</hi>, in its second half,
    the <hi rend="italic">Letter</hi> consists of a presentation of the early
    history of the Christian church in Persia, from its beginnings
    into the sixth century. Very great emphasis is laid on Barsauma
    of Nisibis�s efforts, beginning with the Synod of 486, to
    introduce and sustain a dyophysite Christology of Antiochene
    flavor among the faithful in Persia. In this process,
    Barsauma�s support of �Nestorianism,� according to
    Barhebraeus�s presentation in the <hi rend="italic">Letter</hi>, went hand in
    hand with furthering the moral decline of the bishops by
    allowing them to marry. Barhebraeus emphasizes that before
    Barsauma entered the Persian realm, no one there had ever heard
    of the two-nature teachings. Situating his opponent�s
    Christology in a concrete, and therefore also historically and
    geographically limited context, Barhebraeus manages to present
    his own theological positition not only as the earlier, and
    therefore as the orthodox one, but also as that of the
    <hi rend="italic">oikoumenē</hi>. To what extent such a claim to global
    presence can still be open to �ecumenical� tolerance would have
    to be questioned. Moreover, Panicker clearly knows of and cites
    a passage from Barhebraeus�s later work, which demonstrates the
    significant, even radical shift in the maphrian�s attitude to
    Christological disputes and controversies. In his concluding
    pages, Panicker quotes a passage from the <hi rend="italic">Book of the
    Dove</hi>, likely written after 1279, that has Barhebraeus
    confess that he had become</p>
         <quote>
      �convinced that these quarrels of Christians among themselves
      are not a matter of facts but of words and denominations. For
      all of them confess our Lord to be wholly God and wholly man
      without mixture, without confusion or mutation of natures.
      This bilateral likeness is called by some nature, by others
      person, and by others hypostasis. So I saw all Christian
      people, notwithstanding these differences, possessing one
      unvarying equality. And I wholly eradicated the root of
      hatred from the depth of my heart and I absolutely forsook
      disputation with anyone concerning confession� (p. 208;
      modified).
    </quote>
         <p rend="nn">
            <anchor xml:id="P13"/>[13] Yet
    in his subsequent comments, Panicker draws no consequences from
    such a dismissal of the relevance of �disputation with anyone
    concerning confession.� Instead, he reverts to a
    characterization of Barhebraeus as confessing Cyrillian dogma
    (p. 208), in line with Severus of Antioch, representative of
    �the faith of the early undivided Church� (p. 209), for whom
    �[t]he Nestorian interpretation of union by will and love alone
    is not acceptable� (p. 209), and who �rejects the Duophysetic
    [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] formulas� (p. 209). When Panicker explains that
    Barhebraeus knew that �Chalcedonians and Nestorians� did not
    �intend to affirm� what their formulas express and therefore
    saw no need to �call them heretics� (p. 209), he limits
    Barhebraeus�s overall position to that held in his <hi rend="italic">On the
    Incarnation</hi>. Panicker fails to see here Barhebraeus�s
    change of mind prompted by a deepening of mystical insights
    into his religion through contacts with both Syrian mystical
    writers and Muslim philosophers like al-Ghazali and expressed
    in the <hi rend="italic">Book of the Dove</hi>, a position, which indeed
    makes him a model of ecumenical dialogue �not yet fulfilled�
    (p. 210). The deeper reason for this oversight or neglect,
    which in the end affects Panicker�s ability to see true
    ecumenical potential and power in the theologian he is
    studying, is the limitation of not giving sufficient space and
    consideration to the intrinsic connectedness between
    theological formulations and their conditioning by historical
    developments, including developments and radical changes in an
    individual�s perception of his faith over time. Future studies
    of Barhebraeus�s Christology will benefit from being able to
    expand further on the handy building-blocks which Panicker�s
    systematic theological study of Barhebraeus�s earlier
    Christology contributes to the foundation.</p>_______<lb/>

            <anchor corresp="P1"/>[1] It is
    with great pleasure that we dedicate this issue of <hi rend="italic">Hugoye:
    Journal of Syriac Studies</hi> to four outstanding scholars on
    the occasion of their sixty-fifth birthday. The blessed year of
    1938, during which Brockelmann published his <hi rend="italic">Syrische
    Grammatk</hi>, was the year of birth of Sebastian P. Brock
    (whose last name is a proper prefix of Brockelmann's!), Sidney
    Griffith, Rifaat Ebied, and Samir Khalil Samir SJ. Almost every
    continent (save South America and Antarctica) can claim credit
    to their achievements.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P2"/>[2]
    <hi rend="bold">Sebastian P. Brock</hi> will retire this year from his post
    as Reader in Syriac Studies at the University of Oxford, where
    he is also a Professorial Fellow of Wolfson College.
    Previously, he taught at Birmingham and Cambridge. Sebastian
    has written extensively on almost every aspect of Syriac
    studies. We are particularly indebted to him as he has been
    serving as an academic advisor to Beth Mardutho, The Syriac
    Institute, since its inception in 1992, and on its
    <hi rend="italic">Hugoye</hi> Editorial Board since 1998. He has continuously
    supported our Institute in every way possible. Sebastian is a
    Fellow of the British Academy, Knight of St. Silvester
    (bestowed by the Pope), and Commander of St. Ephrem (bestowed
    by the Syriac Orthodox Patriarch of Antioch).</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P3"/>[3]
    <hi rend="bold">Sidney H. Griffith</hi>, S.T., teaches at The Catholic
    University of America, and is the director of its Institute of
    Christian Oriental Research. His contributions to Syriac
    studies and Christian Arabic studies are well known to all.
    Sidney also serves on the Academic Advisory Board of Beth
    Mardutho, The Syriac Institute, and on its <hi rend="italic">Hugoye</hi>
    Editorial Board. His encouragement and vision helped us shape
    Beth Mardutho to what it is today.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P4"/>[4]
    <hi rend="bold">Rifaat Ebied</hi> is Foundation Professor of Semitic Studies
    at the University of Sydney, Australia, and a Fellow of the
    Australian Academy of the Humanities. He has published
    extensively in the field of Semitic Studies, particularly
    Syriac Studies. Rifaat is the only scholar who has managed to
    attend all the Symposia Syriaca, from 1972 in Rome to Sydney in
    2000 (which he organized).</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P5"/>[5] <hi rend="bold">Samir
    Khalil Samir</hi>, S.J., is one of the better known scholars in
    Christian Arabic studies, a field closely related to Syriac
    studies. Samir teaches at the University of St. Joseph, Beirut,
    and is a consultant to the Pontificio Istituto Orientale, Rome.
    He was the William Paton Fellow 1990 in the Selly Oak
    Colleges.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P6"/>[6] May the
    dedication of this issue be a small token of appreciation to
    their labors in our field. <hi rend="italic">Aksios</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Aksios</hi>,

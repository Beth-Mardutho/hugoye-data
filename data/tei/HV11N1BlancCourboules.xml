         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P1"/>[1] The goal
    of this mission, conducted over five days in October 2006, was
    to evaluate the state of preservation of the Byzantine mosaics
    adorning the sanctuary of the church of Saint Gabriel Monastery
    in Tur Abdin, and to propose solutions for the mosaics’
    long-term safeguard and maintenance. Organized by Alain
    Desreumaux, researcher at the CNRS (Workshop on Ancient Semitic
    Studies at the Collège de France’s Institute of
    Semitic Studies: Eastern Mediterranean UMR) and by
    Sébastien de Courtois, doctoral student at the EHESS,
    the mission was completed thanks only to the support of the
    Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and especially of Michel Pierre,
    who generously covered all transportation costs.</p>
         <head xml:id="HV11N1BlancCourboules3">Location</head>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P2"/>[2] The
    Monastery of Saint Gabriel, or Mar Gabriel, is located in the
    region called Tur Abdin (in Syriac, “Mountain of the
    Servants”), a mountain range in southeast Turkey that
    overlooks the Mesopotamian plain to the southeast of
    Diyarbekir. Southeast of Midyat, the monastery is located 5
    kilometers from the village of Qartamin, 60 kilometers from the
    Syrian, and 90 miles from the Iraqi border. At present, the
    monastery belongs to the Syriac Orthodox Church, and wields
    special spiritual influence in Tur Abdin thanks to the presence
    of Archbishop Mor Timotheos Samuel Aktas, the diocesan bishop
    who resides there.</p>
         <head xml:id="HV11N1BlancCourboules4">History</head>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P3"/>[3] At the
    heart of Tur Abdin history, the Mar Gabriel Monastery has long
    been a center of Christianity and Syriac culture in the Middle
    East. With its monuments and manuscripts, with its many
    illustrious ascetic saints, monks, bishops, scribes and
    writers, Tur Abdin has figured prominently in Syrian and
    Mesopotamian history from the 3<hi rend="sup">rd</hi> century to the
    present.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P4"/>[4] The
    founding of Mar Gabriel likely dates to when Persians murdered
    Bishop Karpos during a raid on Roman Nisibe in the middle of
    the fourth century. A Syriac manuscript most probably dating
    from the thirteenth century (British Museum manuscript, Add.
    17265, which is completed by Sachau manuscript 221 of
    Berlin’s <hi rend="italic">Staatsbibliothek</hi>, dated to the
    seventeenth century) explains the origins of the monastery
    founded in 397 A.D. by Samuel, Karpos’ spiritual son and
    a native of Mardin. One of his disciples, Simeon, succeeded him
    in 408; Simeon had buildings erected and transformed the
    hermit’s retreat into a spiritual hub sheltering hundreds
    of monks. Because of its strategic location on the Roman
    Empire’s eastern frontier, vast construction was
    undertaken, first under Emperor Arcadius, then under Theodosius
    II. But it was only Emperor Anastasius’ generosity that
    allowed the monks to build a large church, finally completed in
    512. As the British Museum’s manuscript tells us,
    Anastasius sent the monks not just gold, but also skilled
    specialized workers-builders, goldsmiths, sculptors, painters
    and mosaicists credited with the sanctuary’s mosaic.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P5"/>[5] In the
    nineteenth and beginning of the twentieth centuries, several
    European travelers visited the monastery: H. Pognon in 1899, C.
    Preusser in 1909, Miss G. Bell in 1909 and 1911. Then, from
    1918 to 1954, Tur Abdin became a military zone closed to
    tourism. In 1954, J. Leroy, researcher at the CNRS, was the
    first European allowed to see the monastery again. These
    visitors left descriptions that provide useful testimony on the
    state of the mosaics’ preservation.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P6"/>[6] Gertrude
    Lowthian Bell, who visited the monastery on two separate
    occasions, took photographs and compiled a map of the
    buildings, which she published along with two drawings of the
    ceiling’s mosaics. In 1958, Abbot Jules Leroy briefly
    mentioned two mosaics he had seen in 1954: “The first
    (published in <hi style="text-transform:uppercase">Preusser</hi>, 1911) shows
    geometric designs with borders containing aces and
    spades”. Concerning the second mosaic, he wrote,
    “one can make out... a cross surrounded by vines.
    According to [G. Bell in <hi style="text-transform:uppercase">Van Berchem</hi> and] <hi style="text-transform:uppercase">Strzygowski</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Amida</hi>,
    [1910,] p. 272, this is the oldest example of wall mosaic in
    Mesopotamia.” Though the mosaic in question is the same
    that decorates the barrel vaulted ceiling. After each having
    stayed at the monastery in 1972, Ernest J. W. Hawkins and
    Marlia C. Mundell conducted further study on the mosaics, and
    published their findings in <hi rend="italic">Dumbarton Oaks Papers</hi>,
    together with a fine photographic illustration (<hi rend="italic">DOP</hi>,
    27, 1973, pp. 279-296, 49 fig.).</p>
         <head xml:id="HV11N1BlancCourboules5">Description of the Decor</head>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P7"/>[7] The
    mosaics in question adorn one room of the main church, situated
    in the eastern section of the monastery. This space-called
    “presbyterium” by G. Bell and
    “sanctuary” by E. Hawkins and M. Mundell-forms the
    church’s choir, and is partially occupied by a modern
    altar affixed to the floor. The room measures 4.33 X 5.83
    meters; at its center, the barrel vault rises to 5.36
    meters.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P8"/>[8] The
    description found in the British Museum’s
    thirteenth-century manuscript states, “The
    sanctuary’s floor is covered with mosaics of white,
    black, yellow, purple and maroon marble, with various figures.
    Its circular walls are covered by marble slabs, and overhead,
    on the vaulted ceiling, there are mosaics of golden
    cubes.”</p>
         <head xml:id="HV11N1BlancCourboules6">The Pavement</head>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P9"/>[9] G. Bell
    mentioned that the pavement was decorated with polychromatic
    marble, of which J. Leroy offered a brief description upon
    which E. Hawkins and M. Mundell further elaborated, also
    presenting three photographs: “The floor of the sanctuary
    is paved with <hi rend="italic">opus sectile</hi> of black, red, and white
    marbles. A rectangular panel fills the west doorway (fig. 49).
    The main floor has a rectangular design with a border around
    the walls and a circular centerpiece with a spiraling pattern
    around a small grey and white variegated marble disc (32 cm. in
    diameter), now partly covered by the step in front of the
    modern altar (figs. 47, 48).”</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P10"/>[10]
    Covering a surface of about 25.25 m<hi rend="sup">2</hi>, the flooring
    is trichromatic <hi rend="italic">opus sectile</hi> (black, white, red).
    Along the checkerboard walls (whose squares are decorated with
    alternating hourglasses and florets with two spear-shaped
    petals each), the flooring’s bordering zone is delimited
    towards the center by a row of white triangles on a black
    background. The central part of the floor mosaic is adorned
    with a grid of rows of adjacent squares, which form large
    quadrangles occupied in turn by four white squares around
    further black or red squares, all of which are decorated with a
    four-petal floret of contrasting colors. At the center of this
    composition, there is a large circle decorated with a
    “triangle shield” with a double border-one border
    on a white background being decorated with alternating black
    beads and black squares and inscribed with a white square; the
    other border being decorated with alternating black/red and
    white squares marked with florets of contrasting colors. The
    center of the shield is marked with a marble disk bordered by a
    line of red and black triangles.</p>
         <head xml:id="HV11N1BlancCourboules7">First Descriptions of the Wall Mosaics</head>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P11"/>[11] Of
    the wall mosaics on the vaulted ceiling and lunettes, of which
    about 45 m² are preserved, G. Bell left precise
    descriptions: “Of the presbyterium mosaic a precious
    fragment remains. The barrel vault is covered with a spreading
    vine, the spirals of which encircle leaves and bunches of
    grapes (Fig. 21 [drawing from a photograph]) … At each
    of the four corners, the vine springs from a double handled
    vase. The body of the vase is divided into two zones by a
    narrow band; in the lower zone a geometric design springs up
    from the pointed base. In the centre of the vine, at the top of
    the vault, there is a rayed <hi rend="italic">crux gemmata</hi> enclosed in a
    circle (Fig. 22 [drawing of the motif]). The vault is bordered
    by three bands of ornament. The first is a forked pattern
    worked in three colours; the second a row of hollow 8-pointed
    stars with a white dot in every point and an ivy leaf in the
    hollow centre; the third a series of rhomboids, separated from
    each other by a cross band of three jewels, the whole closely
    resembling the jewelled bands which occur in Byzantine mosaics
    of the 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi> century. On the S. wall of the chamber,
    under the vault, there are fragments of mosaic in which it is
    possible to make out a small domed tabernacle, the dome carried
    on two pairs of columns. On the N. wall also there are traces
    of mosaic, and upon the floor there is a pavement of different
    coloured marbles. The mosaic on the vault is carried out in
    red, a pale greenish blue, and white, upon a gold
    ground… The execution of the vine is fine and delicate
    in detail, and the realistic treatment is unlike mosaics of the
    Moslem period.”</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P12"/>[12] This
    description was further elaborated upon by M.C. Mundell, who
    was able closely to examine part of the mosaic during her stay
    at the monastery in August 1972. The stylistic analysis that
    she gave was accompanied by many photographs of details, which
    are especially helpful for comparisons as we document of the
    decor’s present state of preservation.</p>
         <head xml:id="HV11N1BlancCourboules8">The Ceiling in 2006</head>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P13"/>[13] The
    ceiling presents a decor of vine leaves springing from four
    canthari vases set in the corners. To accentuate the effect of
    height, the vines narrow towards the center of the ceiling,
    which is marked by a radiating <hi rend="italic">crux gemmata</hi> drawn onto
    a starry background, inside a circle made of a row of trisected
    calices set alternately top to bottom (diam. 1.40 m). In
    smaller medallions, two other crosses standing on steps face
    each other on the vaulted ceiling’s spring: one is
    situated over the west door and is bordered by a guilloche
    (diam. 59 cm); the other, less complete, is located over the
    east apse and is bordered by a two-stranded braid (diam. 66
    cm). The field is limited by three borders (width: 82 cm):
    these are, from the inside outwards, a line of nesting
    chevrons; a strip of eight-pointed stars (each point accented
    with a little circle) decorated with circles marked with a
    heart-shaped leaf; and finally a gem-studded line with
    alternating large and small squares on edge.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P14"/>[14] Less
    complete, the southern and northern lunettes present figurative
    decorations: to the south, framed by two trees (cypresses?), a
    domed tabernacle supported by columns shelters an altar (?)
    with two chalices, and oil-lamps hung on each side of the
    tabernacle; to the north, the decoration, in a ruinous state,
    seems to have been similar, though only the two side trees and
    the tabernacle’s dome remain. Made of glass tesserae, a
    Greek inscription is still partially preserved under the
    tabernacle of the south lunette. This inscription, studied by
    C. Mango (<hi rend="italic">DOP</hi>, 27, 1973, p. 296), likely gave the
    sponsors’, or perhaps the mosaicists’
    signature.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P15"/>[15] The
    backgrounds’ tesserae have gold leaf. In the lunettes,
    these tesserae are set in regular horizontal lines that are
    widely spaced, and their surface is tilted slightly down.
    Jutting out in this way, these tesserae’s reflections are
    more fetching, catching the light better. The lines’ wide
    spacing also allowed for savings on tesserae.</p>
         <head xml:id="HV11N1BlancCourboules9">Identification of Other Decoration</head>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P16"/>[16]
    During our brief mission, only the choir’s decor could be
    studied, though the monastery also possesses vestiges of other
    mosaics. According to G. Bell, “Local tradition insists
    that the vault of the nave was once covered with mosaics like
    the vault of the <hi rend="italic">presbyterium</hi>; possibly a careful
    examination of the brickwork might yield some evidence as to
    the truth of this tale.” E. Hawkins and M. Mandel also
    mentioned the presence of a destroyed mosaic in the
    choir’ small apse: “The shallow apse bears traces
    of destroyed mosaic decoration… All the mosaic in the
    shallow apse recess has been lost, but an irregular area of
    setting-bed (1.15 m. x 0.75 m.) bearing traces of the frescoes
    design is exposed on the north side of the original window
    opening and it is possible that more extends around to the
    other side underneath comparatively modern renderings. The
    design on the setting-bed is not immediately apparent thought
    it seems to be a foliate decoration. Four years ago, as a
    security precaution, the apse window was almost entirely
    blocked up…” In a space situated further to the
    north, Hawkins and Mandel made the following observation:
    “On the south, east, and north walls of the ‘tomb
    chamber’ chapel to the north of the northern compartment
    of the sanctuary, there are areas of the characteristic
    intermediate rendering for mosaics which bears a rough
    herringbone pattern of incised lines. This plaster is similar
    to that which can be seen in some places where mosaic has been
    lost in the sanctuary (fig. 20), and it is reasonable to
    suppose that this chamber was decorated with mosaic at the same
    time as the sanctuary.”</p>
         <head xml:id="HV11N1BlancCourboules10">State of Preservation</head>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P17"/>[17]
    Already in 1909, Miss Bell noticed that “the vault is
    much blackened by smoke; if it were cleaned every detail would
    be visible.” This remark was echoed a half-century later
    by Abbot Leroy: “The ceiling’s mosaic is difficult
    to see because of the filth.” Ten years later, in 1968,
    when he alerted the scientific community to “The present
    state of Christian monuments in southeast Turkey (Tur Abdin and
    surroundings)” (<hi rend="italic">CRAI</hi>, 1968, p. 483), this same
    Abbot Leroy painted a sad picture of the mosaics’
    condition: the painting in the two lunettes were
    “destroyed”, he wrote, and “wide sections [of
    the ceiling] are in danger of immediate collapse”.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P18"/>[18] But
    E. Hawkins, who conducted precise observations in November
    1972, gave a more detailed description of the mosaics’
    state of preservation, also analyzing the remains of ancient
    mortar. To further his examination, Hawkins mentioned that he
    had been able to perform a limited cleaning: “The
    mosaics…cover the vault and lateral lunettes... The
    lower halves of the walls are now bare, except for some
    relatively recent wall paintings… The colors of the
    tesserae are overcast, in some places totally obscured, by thin
    deposits of lime and soot which give to the whole a light gray
    or blackened appearance... The deposits on the mosaics were
    probably created by lime, carried down by rain water from the
    masonry above, combining with soot from the smoke of frequent
    fires below. Around its lower parts the mosaic has been partly
    obscured by splashes and smears of later rough renderings of
    the walls below… Most of the mosaic of the vault
    survives, but there are several losses, notably to the west of
    the center and along the lower part on the west, and to the
    east behind the top of the modern altar. In the south lunette
    most of the lower and middle parts of the mosaic has fallen.
    The greater part of the north lunette mosaic has been lost and
    of what remains much is in imminent danger of collapse. Other
    areas where further falls could occur are at the left side of
    the south lunette and near the center of the vault.”</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P19"/>[19]
    Hawkins described the mosaic’s mortar setting: “As
    might be expected over a brick vault, there are three
    renderings of lime plaster; the first roughly finished, the
    intermediate keyed with the point of a sharp tool with lines in
    a broad herringbone pattern for the reception of the
    setting-bed...”</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P20"/>[20]
    Concerned that certain parts of the mosaics were in danger of
    collapsing, Hawkins made sure to stress that “Adequate
    scaffolding, time, and skilled workmanship will be necessary if
    this is to be averted. There is indeed an urgent need for steps
    to be taken to save this unique decoration.”
    (<hi rend="italic">DOP</hi>, 1973, p. 283).</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P21"/>[21]
    Despite his warnings, no serious conservation work seems to
    have been undertaken until 1997. At that time, the whole
    interior of the church was “restored”, the walls
    were cleaned and all traces of the ancient coating was removed.
    The stones were bared and repointed with white cement mortar.
    This also seems to have been when the gaps in the mosaics of
    the vault’s spring were plugged with beige mortar,
    underlining the vault’s lower section. A comparison of
    the present state of preservation with the photographs Hawkins
    and Mundell included in their article reveals that tesserae
    have disappeared in places, especially in the southern
    lunette’s inscription. The damage probably occurred in
    the course of this restoration work.</p>

    recently, in 2001 or 2002, the region’s governor called
    in a team of Italian restorers who were working on mosaics
    found during emergency excavations conducted because of the
    construction of a dam on the Euphrates, which flooded part of
    the ancient city of Zeugma. This team’s work lasted two
    days, and consisted of gluing a layer of gauze to the mosaic to
    maintain the most weakened sections of the ceiling and
    lunettes. This gauze is still in place.</p>
         <head xml:id="HV11N1BlancCourboules11">State of Preservation in 2006</head>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P23"/>[23] We
    are faced with architecture that was entirely renovated without
    concern for the materials used in the fifth century. The
    mortars used in ancient times were made up of a lime binder
    with a mineral mixture (sand, terra cotta, gravel) which let
    water vapor through. Since it was not hard, it possessed a
    certain elasticity that allowed it to give without breaking.
    This is not the case with the modern cement mortars, waterproof
    and very hard, that were set in place in the twentieth century.
    Overly hard compared to the ancient materials, they are already
    detaching.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P24"/>[24]
    Therefore, in years to come, we can expect many problems with
    the architecture (fissures, buckling) which will risk altering
    the buildings and their decorated parts. This deterioration may
    have a direct influence on the mosaics’ preservation,
    since these have been weakened by the mortar’s failure to
    stick to the walls.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P25"/>[25] It
    is regrettable that the restoration work done thus far was
    conducted without archeological input. This is particularly sad
    given G. Bell’s photograph showing vestiges of wall
    paintings, and also Hawkins and Mundell’s examination of
    the vestiges of mortar that still bore traces of the tesserae
    lost in other parts of the monastery.</p>
         <head xml:id="HV11N1BlancCourboules12">The <hi rend="italic">Opus Sectile</hi>
         </head>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P26"/>[26] In
    the very irregular <hi rend="italic">opus sectile</hi> flooring, ancient
    restorations are still visible. These restorations were carried
    out using grey cement and scattered marble fragments. Though
    the marble pieces remain in place, several parts have cracks
    that show the ancient mortar. The floor is normally covered
    with carpets which have also served to protect it.</p>
         <head xml:id="HV11N1BlancCourboules13">The Mosaic</head>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P27"/>[27] On
    the mosaic of the barrel vault and lunettes, which was noted in
    Miss Bell’s first descriptions, a blackish layer has
    formed on the tesserae’s surface. This layer is composed
    of chalky concretions, dust and the black smoke rising from
    candles and incense used in religious ceremonies, but also
    resulting from general sootiness, even if it seems that at some
    unknown date, the decor may have been dusted off. We were able
    to locate the part cleaned by Hawkins in 1972.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P28"/>[28]
    However, our examination brought to light graver damage, very
    worrisome unless action is taken quickly. In many places, the
    stone and brick masonry has detached from the first layer of
    gross mortar. This has taken place both in the north lunettes
    and on the ceiling. This detachment may cause large chunks of
    the mosaic to fall, particularly in light of the region’s
    vulnerability to seismic activity and aftershocks. The Italian
    team recently called in reinforced many of the detached parts,
    but this can only be a stop-gap measure until true restoration
    work can be undertaken.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P29"/>[29] In
    the south lunette, the lower section has many lacunae, and is
    plugged with the grey cement mortar seen already in the
    photographs Hawkins and Mundell took in 1972. This cracked
    mortar no longer sticks to the wall. In the center of the
    pictured tabernacle, an older crack was filled with glazed blue
    ceramic elements (already visible in 1972). It was on this
    lunette that we located Hawkins’ cleaning test. In
    comparison with the 1972 photograph, the Greek inscription
    under the tabernacle has lost several tesserae, probably when
    the mortar was repointed in 1997.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P30"/>[30] By
    comparison with the earliest illustrations, one can see that
    the north lunette is much more damaged, and a large section of
    the west side has detached, which is already visible in the
    single photograph that we possess of the ceiling, taken in
    1911. The cracks have been plugged with the same sort of grey
    cement mortar. However, though the mosaic seems to have shifted
    only slightly since Hawkins’ stay, all of the mosaics
    contained in this lunette are in utter decay.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P31"/>[31] The
    ceiling also shows cracks: one large crack above the doorway
    leading in from the central nave, on the western arch, already
    visible in G. Bell’s photograph; another large crack
    above the apse and behind the modern altar -this crack was
    plugged, probably in 1997, with a beige mortar similar to the
    one that borders the vault’s spring-; besides those,
    there are numerous smaller cracks, which are old and sooty. Our
    examination of the vault showed that even if the mortar is
    barely sticking to the stone, the tesserae are at least
    satisfactorily adhering to their mortar.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P32"/>[32] Over
    the course of our stay, besides the attentive examination of
    the remains, we were also able to conduct a few cleaning tests
    on the mosaics of the south lunette, and at the bottom of the
    vault in the northeast corner.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P33"/>[33] The
    entirety of the decor is composed of colored, opaque glass
    tesserae (dark blue with nuances of light blue, green, red,
    brown and black), of translucent glass tesserae with a gold and
    silver backing, of tesserae of white, pink or grayish limestone
    (or marble? “Pink marble” according to M. C.
    Mundell). As G. Bell, E. Hawkins and M. Mundell stressed,
    a gentle cleaning would certainly sharpen the palette and help
    identify the materials used.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P34"/>[34] The
    tesserae are irregular in shape, measuring from about 0.8 to 1
    cm along their edge. The tesserae with silver leaf are slightly
    smaller than the others. Several motifs are rendered by plaques
    with specific forms (circles, droplets, etc.)</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P35"/>[35] Our
    observations, however limited, revealed that the limestone,
    colored glass tesserae, and gold-leafed tesserae are in good
    condition. Those with silver leaf are less well preserved since
    the metal at the edges of the tesserae has oxidized (silver
    oxide). No exfoliation of the glass was noted.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P36"/>[36] The
    joints are very sooty, particularly since in this type of wall
    mosaic, the joints are deeply recessed, which increases chances
    for dirt deposit.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P37"/>[37] On
    the ceiling, we noted the presence of metal clamps stuck into
    the mosaic, flush with the tesserae’s surface. These
    hooks reinforce the mortar’s hold on the wall. Because of
    the general sootiness and our limited time, we were unable to
    check the regularity of their placement. A list will have to be
    drawn up, and a more detailed study will need to be conducted
    of the metal’s state of preservation. Depending on the
    results, it may be necessary to replace them.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P38"/>[38] On
    the ceiling’s western spring, a large hole is visible in
    the interior of the structure, in the mosaic and its mortars as
    well as in the wall itself, but a corresponding hole was not
    found on the ceiling’s exterior. It is most probably the
    opening for a conduit whose function we were unable to
    ascertain. The mosaic and its mortar incline slightly into the
    conduit, proof that the conduit already existed when the
    mosaics were being laid.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P39"/>[39]
    Moreover, we also observed various hooks from which light
    fixtures have been hung over the centuries. The insertion of
    these hooks broke numerous holes into the mosaic.</p>
         <head xml:id="HV11N1BlancCourboules14">Cleaning</head>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P40"/>[40]
    During the October 2006 mission, we conducted two cleaning
    tests: the first on the tree pictured on the left side of the
    south lunette (tesserae of colored glass and with gold-leaf),
    the second at the bottom of the ceiling, in the northeast
    corner (tesserae with gold leaf and silver leaf, glass tesserae
    and limestone tesserae). These tests, which were conducted
    mechanically (with scalpels) revealed a good overall
    preservation of the tesserae, except for the silver leaf
    tesserae.</p>

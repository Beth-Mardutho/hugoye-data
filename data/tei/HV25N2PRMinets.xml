            <p xml:lang="en">Nick Posegay’s book investigates the development of ideas
                about vocalization in three Semitic languages—Syriac, Hebrew, and Arabic—from the
                seventh to the eleventh century, with a special emphasis on the ways vowels were
                conceptualized, defined, and distinguished in writing. Even if not “a complete
                history of the vocalization systems” (p. 4) of Semitic languages in the Middle Ages,
                the book offers a much more comprehensive account of intellectual and philological
                exchanges during the formative stages of this history than anything else previously
                available in the field. Its clear achievements are threefold: first, meticulous
                attention to the historiography of the problem and the previous studies that have
                explored vocalization in medieval Semitic traditions; second, careful work with the
                body of primary sources, including the early vocalized manuscripts that have been
                discovered in recent decades and that have greatly enriched the available source
                base; third, a comparative approach that considers the three traditions in their
                mutual dialogue, since, as Posegay observes, many vocalization discoveries crossed
                the boundaries between religious and language communities.</p>
            <p xml:lang="en">The author argues that the phonological ideas developed by
                Syriac, Hebrew, and Arabic scholars to explain their new techniques of vowel
                pointing present a centuries-long history of shared innovations, adaptations, and
                intellectual exchanges, beginning with the first Syriac relative diacritic dots in
                the fifth century and reaching its zenith with the absolute vocalization systems in
                the eleventh century. According to Posegay, the term ‘vocalization’ refers “both to
                the process of physically adding vowel signs to a text and to the intellectual
                domain that explains the creation, function, and application of those signs” (p.
                12). In addition to vocalized manuscripts, the primary sources include multiple
                specialized treatises as well as less systematic comments appearing in the works of
                medieval linguists and grammarians (overview on pp. 15–24). Methodologically, the
                focus of the analysis is on technical terms that describe and differentiate vowels
                in oral speech and writing. The Glossary of Selected Vocalisation Terminology at the
                end of the book (pp. 323–341) is a useful tool to keep track of intricate linguistic
                terms and their cross-references and adaptations in different traditions.</p>
            <p xml:lang="en">The structure of the book reflects the shared trajectory of the
                history of Semitic vocalization. After the introductory Chapter 1 providing the
                basics of the organization and the scope of the study, a summary of sections,
                definitions of the key terms, and an overview of the primary sources (pp. 1–24), the
                book contains three parts. Chapter 2 (pp. 25–133) is a survey of the ways in which
                medieval linguists described vowels as a phonological category distinct from
                consonants, first, via the idea of ‘sounding’ letters most likely borrowed from
                Dionysius Thrax’s <hi rend="italic">Art of Grammar</hi> and the Aristotelian
                tradition; second, via the perception of vowels as ‘movements’ between consonants,
                which may also have Greek precedents; and third, via investigation of <hi
                    rend="italic">matres lectionis</hi>, letters of Semitic alphabets that can
                indicate vowels as well as consonants. Chapter 3 (pp. 135–195) focuses on the
                chronologically earlier ‘relative’ stage of vocalization, which means that
                phonological properties of vowels were described and explained in their relationship
                to other vowels in the same language. In Syriac and Masoretic Hebrew, the
                rudimentary systems of vocalization points developed to distinguish between biblical
                homographs whose vowels were variously conceptualized in binary oppositions as
                ‘thick’ and ‘thin,’ ‘wide’ and ‘narrow,’ ‘above’ and ‘below.’ Similar concepts based
                on the perceived ‘height’ (i.e., ‘backness’) of sounds appeared at this time in
                Arabic to describe allophones of the letter ʾ<hi rend="italic">alif</hi>, rather
                than to indicate cardinal vowels. The articulation of vowels was related to the
                placement of vocalization points in writing. Chapter 4 (pp. 197–307) traces the
                transition to the so-called ‘absolute’ vowel naming systems, i.e., the appearance of
                discrete names for vowels, in the three languages. The development of vowel names in
                Arabic took the lead in the eighth and ninth centuries, setting the context for
                several innovative systems in Syriac and Hebrew by the eleventh century. Posegay
                notices that while ‘relative’ and ‘absolute’ phases overlap, and their duration
                differs between languages, Syriac, Hebrew, and Arabic follow the same trajectory.
                Overall, the discussion detects and explores points of contact between different
                linguistic traditions, as well as the unique adaptations each one of them
                demonstrated, as they move through the same phases. The concluding Chapter 5
                (pp. 309–322) is a helpful summary that pulls together the book’s content and
                argument.</p>
            <p xml:lang="en">The book belongs to the hybrid field of philology and
                intellectual history; social history provides the basic background sufficient for
                the discussion, but intellectual shifts are not immediately linked to the ongoing
                socio-linguistic processes in the Semitic-speaking milieux of the time. Some
                necessary points, nevertheless, are clearly stated. It is well known, for example,
                that Semitic scripts lacked the letters that would enable a writer to record the
                vowels precisely and unambiguously. Posegay mentions the dynamic linguistic
                processes in the Middle East, including the increasing contacts of Arabic-speaking
                Muslims with speakers of other languages, the conversion of speakers of other
                languages to Islam and their attempts to learn Arabic, and the gradual adoption of
                Arabic as a lingua franca by Aramaic-speaking Jews and Syriac Christians. This led
                to an increasing anxiety among representatives of all three traditions about the
                preservation of the correct recitation of their holy scriptures, which was acerbated
                by the greater importance of the written word. According to Posegay, the shared
                history of vocalization among Syriac Christians, Muslims, and Masoretic Jews was, in
                a way, a response to this general challenge. Yet when it comes to the actual
                socio-linguistic history, the three traditions demonstrate very different
                trajectories of development and indeed quite different contexts, demographics, and
                discourse domains in which the languages were used. Regional diversification of late
                Aramaic and Arabic adds more complexity. Taking this into account, it does not seem
                so obvious that the history of vocalization in the three languages must have gone
                through the same stages, i.e., the conceptualization of vowels, relative vowel
                phonology, and absolute vowel naming. The fact that it does—here we should agree
                with Posegay—is not because of similarities, but despite the differences in
                socio-linguistic processes which the three languages experienced. This calls for a
                more nuanced narrative connecting intellectual and socio-linguistic history.</p>
            <p xml:lang="en">The book is an amazing example of a cross-cultural and
                cross-linguistic study. It is a rich resource not only for philologists and those
                interested in the history of linguistics, but for all Judaic, Syriac, and Islamic
                scholars who approach the cultures and religions of the early medieval Middle East
                with a view to their intrinsic interconnectedness and complexity. The book is

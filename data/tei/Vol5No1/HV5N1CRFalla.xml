            <anchor xml:id="P1"/>[1] The
    third Peshitta Symposium combined all the features that make a
    conference worthwhile, enjoyable, and memorable, and was a
    great credit to its conveners, Bas ter Haar Romeny and Konrad
    Jenner. It was held at the beautifully wooded Oud-Poelgeest
    Estate with its moated castle and twenty-three acred walks only
    ten minutes from the centre of Leiden. The conveners seemed to
    spare no effort to care for the needs of the participants and
    ensure that the academic focus of the symposium would be of the
    highest standard. The meeting ended with a superb dinner hosted
    by E.J. Brill.</p>
         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P2"/>[2] The
    published theme of the symposium was <hi rend="italic">The Peshitta: Its Use
    in Literature and Liturgy</hi>. The aim was to gain a more
    detailed and comprehensive picture of the textual history of
    the Peshitta of the Old Testament by discussing its
    preservation in the patristic literature of the Syriac
    churches. In the words of the conveners, "As much progress has
    been made on the Syriac Fathers …, it is time to see where we
    stand: what has been done so far in this respect, what should
    be done, and how can we integrate the results of this research
    into the picture that has been formed on the basis of Bible
    manuscripts." This focus intentionally embraced related issues
    such as the development of the Peshitta text as "an event
    within the history of the Syrian Churches," and "the way the
    Peshitta was received and assessed by its users, whether in
    exegetical or historical literature or in liturgy." Attention
    to the New Testament was also welcomed as an inseparable part
    of the symposium's focused exploration.</p>
         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P3"/>[3] Three
    excellent keynote lectures were presented by Lucas Van Rompay,
    <hi rend="italic">Between the School and the Monk's Cell: The Syriac
    Commentary Tradition</hi>; Sebastian Brock, <hi rend="italic">The Use of the
    Syriac Versions in the Liturgy</hi>; and Bill Petersen,
    <hi rend="italic">Problems in the Syriac New Testament and How Syrian Exegetes
    Solved Them</hi>. The first evening ended with a slide
    presentation by Mat Immerzeel on <hi rend="italic">The Cross on the Banner:
    Christian wall Paintings in Lebanon and Syria</hi>.</p>
         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P4"/>[4] The
    abstracts of all thirty papers are presented in full and
    arranged alphabetically according to author. In this way, the
    reader will gain the author's own pre-publication perspective
    of her or his paper. Authors were invited to submit
    post-symposium revisions, and in consequence, some abstracts
    differ from those published in the symposium handbook.</p>
         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P5"/>[5] The
    symposium also included a Peshitta Institute report on the
    progress of the Peshitta Programme, and a general discussion of
    the New Annotated Translation of the Syriac Bible (NEATS). The
    former, prepared by Konrad Jenner, is presented at the very end
    of this report.</p>

         <head>The Use of the Syriac Versions in the Liturgy</head>
         <p style="text-align:left">
            <hi rend="author">Sebastian
    Brock, University of Oxford</hi>
         </p>
         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P6"/>[6] The
    paper was divided into two parts, the first concerning direct
    use (in biblical readings), and the second on indirect use
    (technical terms of biblical origin, allusions etc.).</p>
         <p>The first part concentrated on the developments over the
    centuries in how texts intended for liturgical reading were
    presented. Five main stages in this development were identified
    in the manuscript tradition.</p>
         <p>The second part looked at three different aspects: (1) some
    liturgical terms specific to the Syriac tradition which had
    their origins in the Syriac biblical text. Here the following
    terms were covered: rushma (&lt; Ezek 9:4), rahhep (&lt; Gen
    1:2), aggen (&lt; Luke 1:35, John 1:14), shra (with possible
    links with the Palestinian Targum tradition) and the biblical
    sources for lbesh pagra and similar phraseology. (2) The
    textual basis for certain terms and phrases. Here the following
    were discussed: Christ as the "Ancient of Days"; the title
    "King Messiah"; various phraseological links with the
    Palestinian Targum tradition; "the bars of Sheol" (replacing
    "the gates" in Matt 16:18); and "the bridal chamber" (replacing
    "the wedding feast" in Matt 25:10). (3) Some exegetical
    aspects. Here a few examples were given of the deliberate
    linking of different passages by means of the transfer of
    distinctive vocabulary - with a warning to the textual critic
    in search of variants in the biblical texts. Finally, brief
    attention was drawn to the existence, above all in the East and
    West Syriac Festal Hymnaries, of some fine poetry (albeit in
    truncated form, especially in the printed editions): for the
    full, or fuller forms, reference to the earliest manuscripts
    available is essential. The paper ended with a quotation from
    an otherwise unknown poem on Genesis 22, to be found in an East
    Syriac Burial Service for Children.</p>
         <head>Aspects of the Commentary on Numbers by Išo'dad of
    Merv</head>
         <p style="text-align:left">
            <hi rend="author">Johann Cook,
    Universiteit Stellenbosch</hi>
         </p>
         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P7"/>[7] Most of
    the biblical commentaries of IŠO`DAD of Merv have been
    researched to some extent. The work by C van den Eynde (<hi rend="italic">le
    commentaire d´ IŠO`DAD de Merv sur l´Ancient testament</hi>) is
    the most prominent in this regard. He has translated many of
    this ancient author's commentaries and in the process offered
    many useful remarks. Clarke, Van Rompay, Molenberg, Ter Haar
    Romeny and others have also dealt with aspects of this
    prominent Syriac author. However, these scholars mostly
    addressed the relationship between different ancient authors.
    Clarke, for example, compared IŠO`bar Nun with IŠO`DAD of Merv
    and Theodore bar Koni.</p>
         <p>These comparisons were moreover primarily executed in
    regards to the book of Genesis. As a matter of fact not much
    has been done in connection with the 4th book of the
    pentateuch, Numbers, which is the subject of this contribution.
    This paper, which is limited in intent and extent, will deal
    with aspects of the exegetical method of the mentioned Syriac
    commentary. Others have defined the exegetical approach of
    IŠO`DAD as belonging to the genre of questiones. This certainly
    applies to the book of Genesis. However, in Numbers the author
    applies a seemingly additional exegetical stylistic feature. He
    quotes words from Scripture like <hi rend="italic">qry'</hi> in II,2 and then
    offers an explanation. Or in III, 26: <hi rend="italic">glg' [plural]</hi>:
    "According to John they are the branches of the wood......".
    This seems to be related to the Pesher exegetical method found
    at Qumran. IŠO`DAD also makes frequent references to scripture,
    interpreting scripture by means of scripture. Cf. for example:
    I, 50: "Concerning the tent of tabernacle, scripture says: Like
    one who......". The particle <hi rend="italic">lm</hi> is used as well as the
    verbal form <hi rend="italic">'mr</hi>. In trying to define its genre Molenberg
    talks of <hi rend="italic">scholia</hi> and <hi rend="italic">aporiai</hi> in this regard.</p>
         <p>This paper will at the same time act as a pilot study for a
    planned monograph on the Peshitta version of Numbers.</p>
         <head>The Greek vs. the Peshitta in a West Syrian Exegetical
    Collection (BL Add. 12168)</head>
    
         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P8"/>[8] The
    exegetical collection preserved in the manuscript London BL
    Add. 12168, from the eighth or ninth century, discusses the
    greater part of the Old and New Testaments (Wright,
    <hi rend="italic">Catalogue</hi>, 2:904-908). The work, which may be called the
    <hi rend="italic">London Collection</hi>, consists of extracts from various,
    mostly Greek authors. The choice of authors quoted gives a good
    impression of its profile. For the Pentateuch we find the names
    of Cyril of Alexandria, Severus of Antioch, Gregory of
    Nazianzus, and Ephrem; for the Prophets, Athanasius, Cyril,
    Severus, Basil the Great, Gregory of Nyssa, John Chrysostom,
    and Ephrem. In other words: some of the more moderate
    Alexandrians, the moderate Antiochene Chrysostom, the
    Miaphysite leader Severus, the Cappadocians, and finally Ephrem
    as the only Syrian authority.</p>
         <p>The <hi rend="italic">London Collection</hi> quotes the biblical text in a
    number of instances from the Syro-Hexapla; at other places it
    seems to give a direct translation from the Greek biblical text
    of the commentaries quoted; and in yet other instances it
    quotes the Peshitta. The compiler also added an appendix on the
    various Greek versions, comparable but not identical with Moses
    bar Kepa's discussion of this subject. This paper will discuss
    the position of the <hi rend="italic">London Collection</hi> in the
    contemporary debate on the right version of the biblical
    text.</p>
         <head>The Biblical Text in the Disputation of Sergius the Stylite
    against a Jew</head>
    
         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P9"/>[9] The
    Disputation of Sergius the Stylite is an eighth century text
    which purports to record a written-up version of a dialogue
    between a Jewish rabbi and a Christian stylite. The discussion
    is located in Gousit, a place about which little is known, but
    which was somewhere near Homs (Emesa) in southern Syria. The
    text is preserved in a single manuscript (BM Add.17,199) which
    William Wright dated to the eighth century on the basis of its
    "rather inelegant Estrangela". The colophon is damaged and
    preserves only the name of the scribe (Romanus the abbot) and
    not the date of his work. The date of the actual Disputation is
    not in doubt since three times it refers to the seven hundred
    years which have passed since the Jews lost everything -
    prophets, priests, temple, etc.</p>
         <p>As in most Jewish-Christian dialogues from the ancient
    period the bulk of the Disputation is taken up with arguments
    about the relevance of biblical texts to the situations of the
    Christian Church and the Jewish people. It contains over 340
    biblical quotations, the bulk of them (300) from the Old
    Testament. Some of these are quite extensive in scope. It also
    contains a number of quotations from an otherwise unattested
    Syriac version of books 1-5 of Josephus' <hi rend="italic">War of the
    Jews</hi>; book 6 of this version is preserved in 7a1 as the
    fifth Book of the Maccabees.</p>
         <p>The Old Testament biblical quotations in the Disputation
    fall naturally into four groups:</p>
         <list type="ordered">
            <item>Direct, exact quotations from the Peshitta (c. 130).</item>
            <item>OT quotations whose text is influenced by the form in
      which they are cited in the New Testament (14).</item>
            <item>Quotations (from memory?) in which text and
      interpretation are intermingled, or contaminated by other
      biblical texts.</item>
            <item>A striking series of agrapha based on a now lost book of
      testimony texts which consisted of a biography of Jesus in
      Old Testament texts.</item>
         </list>
         <p>This paper deals with the implications for the history of
    the Peshitta OT of the form of the text cited in the
    Disputation but also with the way in which the results of the
    Peshitta Project can, in their turn, be used to help with the
    dating of patristic texts and manuscripts. It attempts to show
    that:</p>
         <list type="unordered">
            <item>The Disputation contains some valuable readings which are
      also attested in manuscripts like 5b1, 6b1, and 9a1 which, in
      turn, probably preserve the original form of the Peshitta
      version;</item>
            <item>it is unlikely that it preserves original Peshitta
      readings that have been lost from the biblical
      manuscripts;</item>
            <item>patristic texts like the Disputation can throw light on
      the factors generating many variants in the Peshitta version,
      particularly the need for a Christian understanding of the
      text versus the Jewish.</item>
            <item>and, finally, that what we now know about the history of
      the Peshitta version can be used as a valuable tool for
      confirming or establishing the dates of Syriac patristic
      texts which contain lots of biblical citations.<lb/>

         <head>Reworking The Biblical Text in the Dramatic Dialogue Poems
    on the Old Testament Patriarch Joseph</head>
         <p style="text-align:left">
            <hi rend="author">Kristian Heal,

         </p>
         <p rend="nn">
            <anchor xml:id="P10"/>[10] In
    addition to the materials traditionally employed for the study
    of Old Testament interpretation in the Syriac tradition, there
    is another category of texts which deserves more attention than
    has previously been given, namely the dramatic dialogue poems
    on biblical themes.This paper focuses on three exegetical
    motifs that appear in the dramatic dialogue poems on the Old
    Testament patriarch Joseph. The motifs are studied with respect
    to the biblical text and Jewish sources in an attempt to answer
    why and how the retellings of the Joseph narrative were
    developed in a particular way.</p>
         <head>The Service Books as a Source for Text Criticism, Textual
    History and Applied Science of Religion</head>
         <p style="text-align:left">
            <hi rend="author">Konrad Jenner,
    Universiteit Leiden</hi>
         </p>
         <p rend="nn">
            <anchor xml:id="P11"/>[11] Part
    2 of Wright's Catalogue of Syriac Manuscripts in The British
    Museum contains for the greater part the description of Service
    Books. The large number and diversity in content gives the
    impression that ferial, Sunday and high feast services were the
    foundation of Syriac Christianity and identified Christian
    community life. It seems that liturgy was the backbone of these
    services and the heartbeat of Syriac religious life. Thus, at
    the one hand, liturgy is the reflection of regional and
    national culture and society, at the other hand an effective
    instrument to implement and uphold prescriptions as to
    religious standards and values. Many a service book contains or
    refers to biblical passages, see e.g., the lectionaries from
    the ninth century and later that provide us with a substantial
    amount of variants as may be clear from the critical apparatus
    in the volumes of The Old Testament in Syriac. One may expect
    that service books present a connection between religious life,
    Christian perceptions on culture and society, and the reception
    (i.e. actual use and transmission as well as the interpretation
    or actualization) of the biblical text. Thus, service books may
    give an impression of the motives for the selection of texts
    and an indication for the authority and the degree of
    fluctuation (i.e. plasticity) of the biblical text.</p>
         <head>The Old Testament in the New: The Syriac Versions of the
    New Testament as a Witness to the Text of the Old Testament
    Peshitta</head>
    
         <p rend="nn">
            <anchor xml:id="P12"/>[12] The
    earliest attestation of the reading and use of the Old
    Testament Peshitta is not to be found in the fourth century
    writings of Aphrahat and Ephrem, nor in the references to <hi rend="italic">ho
    Suros</hi> in Eusebius of Emesa, but in the Old Testament
    quotations contained the early Syriac versions of the New
    Testament. As has been known for a long time, these quotations
    often conform to the OT Peshitta, a tendency leading at times
    to marked divergence from the Greek NT text. Recent research
    has shown that this phenomenon is due to the habit of the first
    Syriac translators of the NT-Tatian for the gospels, anonymous
    translators for the other books-who followed the local OT text
    in OT quotations.</p>
         <p>The use of the Syriac OT in the Syriac NT sheds light on the
    date and milieu of the OT Peshitta and on the origins of Syriac
    speaking Christianity. Another implication is that the text of
    OT quotations in the Syriac NT must be considered an important
    witness to the text of the OT Peshitta. This last point, which
    has been almost entirely neglected by textual critics of the OT
    Peshitta, will be illustrated with a couple of examples showing
    that the Syriac NT may at times have preserved primitive OT
    Peshitta readings no longer transmitted by the manuscripts of
    the OT Peshitta.</p>
         <head>The Syriac Massora and the New Testament Peshitta</head>
         <p style="text-align:left">
            <hi rend="author">Andreas Juckel,
    Institut für neutestamentliche Textforschung,
    Münster</hi>
         </p>
         <p rend="nn">
            <anchor xml:id="P13"/>[13] The
    recently (2000) installed NT Peshitta project (St. Paul's
    Letters) at Münster University is based on ca. 50 manuscripts
    of the first millennium. The editorial policy of the project is
    to print the 'majority text' of the 5th/6th century drawn from
    the ca. 15 earliest manuscripts (5th-7th century). To present
    the development of the text from its origin (ca. 400/450) to
    James of Edessa (died 708) and its transmission in the period
    from the 7th to the 12th century (from James to Dionysius bar
    Salibi) is the scope of the project. But did the conformity of
    the NT Peshitta really develop, is there a 'history' of the
    text which can offer guidelines for an editorial policy? It is
    the topic of the present paper to argue for two specific
    periods within the transmission of the Peshitta text, for a
    'pre-' and 'post-Massoretic' period.</p>
         <p>The first period of the Peshitta is a period of 'revision',
    dominated by the development towards the Greek text,
    culminating in the 'Philoxenian' (507/08) and the 'Harklean'
    (615/16) versions which both update the Peshitta according to
    an increasing 'Greek' standard. Variants of the Peshitta might
    be due either to Greek influence (in the proper sense) or to
    the influence of the two fellow versions. For editorial policy
    this background offers the general guideline to follow the
    non-grecizing reading of the 'majority text' (and to allow for
    the possibility of non-grecizing variants to be more original
    than the 'majority text'). The second period of the Peshitta is
    a 'philological' one and corresponds with the new political and
    cultural situation under Islamic rule. Now the Peshitta is the
    'Syriac' bible (the Harklean the 'Greek') contributing to
    'Aramaic' identity. It is subjected to 'scientific' care, the
    orthographical features are regularlized, the pronunciation is
    fixed by the invention of vowel signs. The 'spiritus rector' of
    this period is James of Edessa, its philological handbook is
    the 'Massora' (extant in 15 manuscripts) which relies on
    principles introduced by James.</p>
         <p>By paying attention to 'massoretic' features in Peshitta
    manuscripts (orthography, variants recorded by the 'Massora',
    etc.) editorial policy will be able to distinguish
    'pre-massoretic' manuscripts from those of obvious 'massoretic'
    imprint. This does not constitute a 'history' of the Peshitta
    text but will improve the judgement upon an 'early' and a
    'later' stage of the Peshitta (F.J.A. Hort: 'Knowledge of
    documents should precede final judgement upon readings').
    Remarks on the OT quotations in the NT, on the 'Massora' and on
    James of Edessa quoting the NT will reflect the implications of
    an editorial policy based on a 'qualified minority of
    pre-massoretic manuscripts'.</p>

         <head>The Four Kingdoms in Peshitta Daniel 7 in the Light of the
    Early History of Interpretation</head>
         <p style="text-align:left">

            <anchor xml:id="P15"/>[15] The
    Peshitta text of Daniel 7:1-8, as published in the Leiden
    edition (vol. III/iv, Leiden 1980), contains inscriptions which
    represent a specific interpretation of 'the four kingdoms': the
    k. of the Babylonians, the k. of the Medes, the k. of the
    Persians, the k. of the Greeks. The question arises whether
    this interpretation goes back to the original translator of the
    book, or not. To answer this question, the interpretation as
    attested in the Pesh Dan. 7 will be discussed in the light of
    the early history of interpretation regarding the motif of the
    four kingdoms. Attention will be given to Jewish (Josephus; 4
    Ezra; Targum to the Prophets), Christian (Syrian Baruch Apoc.,
    Aphrahat, Chrysostomus, Jerome, Ishodad of Merv) and pagan
    sources (Porphyry). It is argued that the glosses in Pesh
    Daniel 7:1-8 are of a later date (5th century) than the time
    when the Syriac version of Daniel was produced (presumably the
    second century CE). The identification of the fourth beast in
    Pesh Daniel 7 as 'the kingdom of the Greeks' (instead of 'the
    kingdom of the Romans' according to the dominant tradition)
    seems to go back to Porphyry's Daniel interpretation.</p>

    Since their first publication (Wright, 1869), Aphrahat's
    twenty-three homilies (I-X AD 336/7; XI-XXII AD 343/4; XXIII
    345) never ceased to impress their readers by the astonishing
    scriptural knowledge of their author. Not only did he use his
    OT according to the traditional pattern of prophecy and
    fulfilment (e.g. Daniel 8, 4, 2, and 7 in Hom. V, and Dan. 9 in
    Hom. XIX), but he prefers to give long lists of examples and
    examplary persons from the Old Testament (sometimes continued
    right into the NT), after the example of Hebrews 11.</p>
         <p>In this paper I should like to call attention to Aphrahat's
    frequent use of <hi rend="italic">typology</hi> as a method of exegesis. In
    that case persons and happenings from the Old Testament are
    conceived as a prototype (<hi rend="italic">typos</hi>; cf. Rom. 5:14 [Adam], 1
    Cor. 10:6 [the following rock; it happened <hi rend="italic">tepikw</hi>, v.
    11]) of their New Testament counterpart (<hi rend="italic">antitypos/n</hi>;
    cf. 1 Peter 3:21 [baptism]). In contrast with the allegorizing
    method, here the concrete persons, things and happenings are
    considered as hidden prefigurations of what is revealed in the
    gospels around the person of Jesus Christ. In the eyes of the
    author, this is guaranteed by the intrinsic connection which
    exists between the two covenants, those of Moses and Jesus.
    E.g. the 'tree' (piece of wood) thrown by Moses into the water
    of Marah in order to sweeten it (Exod. 15:25) is seen as a
    prefiguration (Syriac <hi rend="italic">
               <hi rend="underline">t</hi>wps'</hi> or <hi rend="italic">rz'</hi>) of the cross of
    Christ.</p>
         <p>This exegetical device, employed already by Justin, Irenaeus
    and others, was made his trade-mark by Aphrahat, who used it in
    several homilies (IV [Jacob], XII, XXIIf. [Moses], VI [Eliah],
    XI [Joshua]), but in particular in hom. XXI, which for the
    greater part consists of a long list of OT exemplary persons
    (as indicated above), all of them interpreted typologically. I
    will concentrate on some of these: Moses, Joshua, Eliah and
    Eliza. Regularly, the characteristic <hi rend="italic">Steigerung</hi>
    (Goppelt) between the OT exemplar and its NT counterpart will
    come to the fore.</p>

    Quotations in Syriac writers have been considered a fruitful
    source for detecting Peshitta phrases and passages to shed
    light on the history of the text's transmission. Words or
    phrases are seen as evidence of the text familiar to the
    writer, his circle and his place.</p>
         <p>However the evidence does not support this argument. As in
    the case of Shubhalmaran's general use of Scripture, and
    Aphraat's use of Leviticus, quotations are shaped not by their
    original source but by the author's manipulation of quotations
    to support his argument. The genre of scripture quoted is an
    element of the argument which uses it. Some short quotations
    are careful and close to the Peshitta, but longer ones are
    often summaries or selections, with the order changed if felt
    necessary. The appeal is less to the exact words than to the
    general sense, or even inferences drawn from them.</p>
         <p>Quotations from Leviticus are found in:</p>
         <list type="ordered">
            <item>lectionaries: Eastern ones choosing moralistically,
      Western ones for analogy;</item>
            <item>controversies with Jews e.g. Sergius the Stylite: exact
      phrases are less important than inference;</item>
            <item>hexaemeron e.g. Jacob of Edessa: passages are used for
      analogy and inference;</item>
            <item>ascetic e.g. John of Dalyatha: the quotations are
      allusive and referential.</item>
         </list>
         <p>Hence the literature quoted, and (even more) the
    argumentative context, are the determining factors in shaping
    quotation. "Citation très libre" is a consequence of rhetoric
    rather than failure of memory; exactness is required only when
    a specific word or short phrase is needed in close
    exegesis.</p>

    the identity of that Biblical version. Although the chronology
    of the Syriac versions of the New Testament makes it obvious
    that the Syriac version of the New Testament referred to in the
    Syriac Commentary on the Diatessaron cannot be identified as
    the Peshitta, the wider theme of the Symposium-the use of the

    Bible-might justify the main question of this paper.</p>

    Exegetes of the Apostolic Church of the East sometimes
    emphasize that their understanding of the biblical text
    corresponds to this Church's great theological authority,
    Theodore of Mopsuestia (died 428), who was called 'the
    interpreter' in exegetical works. Unfortunately, such claims
    cannot be examined in the sources, as his posthumous
    anathematization lead to the destruction of most of his
    original texts. However, the Syriac translation of Theodore's
    commentary to the Psalms 119 and 139-147 is still extant and
    allows us to compare it with Ishodad of Merv's (mentioned ca.
    850) short comments to these Psalms. The first objective of
    this paper is the evaluation of Ishodad's use of Theodore's
    commentary and the assessment of his exegetical approach in
    those cases, where he does not use Theodore's commentary. An
    additional look into the Ms. Mingana 58 adds to the
    understanding of Ishodad's way of interpretation.</p>
         <p>Timothy I, the great Catholicos of the Church of the East
    (died 823) tells in one of his letters about his efforts to
    provide a copy of the Syrohexapla for the school of Bet Lapat.
    Thus, he introduced an important tool for textual criticism
    into the academies of the Church of the East. In his
    commentary, Ishodad sometimes quotes the Syriac translations of
    other biblical versions ('the Greek', 'the Hebrew') part of
    which he probably copied from the Syrohexapla. Even the Syriac
    translation of Theodore's commentary may add 'the Greek'
    version after the lemma from the Peshitta at the beginning of a
    paragraph of interpretation. Ishodad also used these
    attestations of the 'Greek' text. The second objective of this
    paper is to provide a description of Ishodad's use of such
    variant readings and suggestions to their provenance.</p>

    Ishodad of Merv's knowledge of Hebrew is evidenced both in his
    use and his non-use of Hebrew in his commentary on the Peshitta
    of Ezekiel. In his commentary on Ezekiel, Ishodad refers to
    'the Hebrew' (<hi rend="italic">
               <hi rend="sup">c</hi>ibraya</hi>) 7 times. The 7 cases
    of 'the Hebrew' can be divided into 3 typological categories: a
    reference to 'the Hebrew' as the source of the Syriac version
    which we call the Peshitta (28:10); references to Hebrew words
    (1:1; 20:29; 43:15); and references to Hebrew versional
    readings which differ from the Syriac (1:18; 9:2; 25:9). These
    case will be presented and analyzed with an attempt made to
    identify the source of Ishodad's Hebrew knowledge. In addition,
    a key case where Ishodad should have evoked the Hebrew, but did
    not, will be examined. From this study, an answer to the
    question about the extent of Ishodad's knowledge of Hebrew-what
    he knew and what he did not know-will be suggested.
    Furthermore, implications about the modern critical approach to
    the Peshitta will be drawn.</p>

         <p style="text-align:left">

            <anchor xml:id="P21"/>[21] The
    Syriac text of <hi rend="italic">The Acts of Judas Thomas</hi> offers Peshitta
    scholars a window into the Syriac Bible and its interpretation
    in the third century. Where this symposium focuses on the text
    of the Peshitta in what might be called the 'proto-Peshitta'
    period, the source text for the biblical citations and
    allusions in this early Syriac narrative becomes of interest.
    A.F.J. Klijn's assessment of these citations provides a point
    of departure: 'we may suppose that originally a Diatessaron was
    used in quoting the New Testament. At a later stage the text
    was adapted to the separate gospels' (<hi rend="italic">The Acts of
    Thomas</hi>, [NT.S 5; Leiden 1962] 17). This conclusion was
    repeated by W. Petersen who noted: 'to date, no comprehensive
    study of the gospel citations in the <hi rend="italic">Acts</hi> has been
    conducted' (<hi rend="italic">Tatian's Diatessaron</hi>, [VC.S 25; Leiden 1994]
    215). The <hi rend="italic">Acts</hi> explicitly cites the New Testament seven
    times in addition to its version of the 'Our Father'. Two
    citations that depart significantly from the Greek and Latin
    canonical traditions and from the Peshitta are examined with a
    view to establishing whether they derive from the Diatessaron
    or from the Vetus Syra. The first example is taken from §28:
    'Therefore how much will he care for you, you of little faith'
    (<hi rend="italic">kma haki <hi rend="sup">c</hi>laykun netb<hi rend="underline">t</hi>el leh <hi rend="underline">h</hi>siray haymanuta</hi>) and is a citation of
    Matt 6,30 and Luke 12,28. The second example is taken from §144
    and involves the plus 'and our sins' (<hi rend="italic">wa<hi rend="underline">ht</hi>ahayn</hi>) in the <hi rend="italic">Acts</hi> version of
    the 'Our Father'.</p>

            <anchor xml:id="P22"/>[22] When
    we attempt to situate Syriac exegeses in the broader history of
    exegesis in Christianity, one of the most important issues is
    the relationship between exegeses of the Greek Antiochenes and
    those of the Syriac Fathers. In order to elucidate their
    characteristics, it is the best to investigate them in the time
    before the former started influencing the latter. In this
    study, the representatives of the Antiochene exegetical school
    and those of the fairly contemporary Syriac exegesis are
    elaborated. Before we set out to study their concrete exegeses,
    it is a prerequisite to have a clear picture of what they think
    interpretation is, i.e., the central issue of modern
    hermeneutics. It has been indicated that the Syriac
    hermeneutics is an Antiochene type, although it has been
    scarcely compared in detail with the Antiochene.</p>
         <p>Among Greek Antiochenes, this study focuses on Diodore of
    Tarsus, Theodore of Mopsuestia and, above all, John Chrysostom,
    because his related texts are numerous and extant in original
    Greek. According to Chrysostom, the Bible is not difficult or
    ambiguous. In the case of seemingly unclear passages, the
    author himself explains them on condition that readers
    attentively follow the intention of the text. Even if a
    biblical writer does not explain them, other biblical writers
    instead can do so. So it is not Chrysostom who interprets
    Scripture, but Scripture which interprets itself. His audience
    cannot easily oppose such an interpretation.<lb/>
    With regard to Syriac Fathers, this study treats Aphrahat and,
    especially, Ephrem of Nisibis in whose works many related
    passages can be found. According to Ephrem, since God bestowed
    many images of the biblical words in proportion to preferences
    of interpreters, they understand only a tiny portion of the
    whole. Benefits for everyone are hidden for his meditation; he
    learns step by step. Interpretations are made according to the
    interpreters' capacity. So there is no particular
    interpretation valid for anyone at any time.</p>
         <p>This study concludes with a comparison between the Greek
    Antiochenes and the Syriac Fathers. As the former tend to teach
    their hearers the one true interpretation of a certain passage
    in the Bible, the latter are more open to learn many other
    possibilities of interpretations. Between these lie fundamental
    dissimilarities so that one should not regard the Syriac
    hermeneutics as an Antiochene type.</p>

    After brief review of current questions in the study of the
    early history of Peshitta Proverbs, this paper undertakes
    text-critical analysis of a corpus of citations from two
    fourth-century Syriac patristic sources. The original Syriac of
    Aphrahat's <hi rend="italic">Demonstrations</hi> (337-345 CE) and the <hi rend="italic">Liber
    Graduum</hi> (ca. 400) both pre-date the earliest extant Ms of
    Peshitta Proverbs (6h16). The primary surviving Mss of the
    Demonstrations also pre-date 6h16, although those of the Liber
    Graduum do not.</p>
         <p>Within Aphrahat's work, twelve different passages contain
    quotations of portions of the following Proverbs passages: 9:9;
    10:10, 27; 11:5, 31; 16:19, 32; 18:19; 20:6, 9; 25:21; 28:2,
    13, 16; 29:23. Within the Liber Graduum, six different passages
    contain portions of Proverbs 10:12; 17:5; 18:10; and 24:17.
    Though not set apart as distinct lemmata, all of the Aphrahat
    quotations are formal, being introduced by one of his standard
    formulas of Scripture citation, such as 'as it says,' 'as it is
    written,' etc. Three of the Liber Graduum quotations are so
    introduced.</p>
         <p>As is typical of the biblical quotations throughout both
    works, these Proverbs texts are imbedded within the author's
    own extended prose, calling into question their literalness.
    None of these citations reproduces an entire verse. In earlier
    publications, R. Owens has discussed the difficulty that
    confronts the scholar who seeks text-critical witness in
    Aphrahat's biblical. On the one hand, Aphrahat obviously quotes
    casually or from memory much of the time, calling up only a
    clause or phrase, sometimes adapting the wording slightly to
    fit the vocabulary, or conflating similar passages. On the
    other hand, his quotes are full of apparently exact
    reproductions of substantial portions of the Peshitta text-so
    full that one cannot be content simply to ignore this early
    corpus of biblical quotation. Much of this paper is given over
    to detailed discussion of the methodological problems involved
    in trying to use such patristic quotations as textual
    witnesses.</p>

    would like to argue that this rendering of the Greek original

    subsequent period. Among the Christian (Syriac, Greek,

    methods and techniques Syrian Christian exegetes brought to
    bear on the Syriac testaments are exceptionally creative,
    suggestive, and often unique. However, when compared with the
    Old Testament (the Hebrew Bible), the New Testament confronts
    an exegete with special challenges. At least three can be
    readily identified. First, while the Hebrew Bible has some
    parallel passages and/or multiple accounts, the New Testament
    has many more such accounts (viz., the gospels), and they
    concern the very center of the Christian religion (the life,
    sayings, and acts of Jesus), not peripheral matters. However,
    as is well known, the gospels are often inconsistent and/or
    contradictory. Therefore, despite the fact that one is working
    at the very heart of the Christian belief-system, an exegete
    must somehow either choose among the various accounts, or
    reconcile them by means of some explanation. Second, while the
    Hebrew Bible was the touchstone for Jewish theology, the New
    Testament became the touchstone for Christian theology; its
    writings (e.g., the Pauline epistles) formed the basis for (and
    became incorporated into) 'normative' Christian theology. But
    theology is always changing. Therefore, what had been
    'normative' in an earlier time might later be deemed
    unacceptable. In such a case the options are either to change
    the text itself (by removing or modifying the unacceptable
    item), or to offer a new interpretation, consonant with the
    'new' theology. Third and finally, when compared with the Greek
    New Testament at a textual level, the Syriac New Testament
    contains a significant number of important variant readings.
    How one evaluates them (as relics from a 'primitive' strata of
    the NT, or as late, singular, 'local' changes, produced in
    Syria, for the Syrian 'market') is often unclear, and remains

         <p>This paper will examine how some of the great Syrian
    exegetes (Aphrahat, Ephrem, and Isho'dad, for example)
    perceived these problems, grappled with them, and eventually
    solved them. As byproducts of this examination, we will gain

            <anchor xml:id="P26"/>[26] The
    <hi rend="italic">Discourses on Christian Life and Character</hi> of the West
    Syrian bishop Philoxenus of Mabbug (450-523 AD) contain four
    quotations from the book of Sirach. These quotations show some
    remarkable differences from the text in the extant Peshitta
    manuscripts and some agreements with the Greek text of Sirach.
    In this respect the Sirach quotations differ from citations
    from Genesis, Exodus, Isaiah, and Psalms in the
    <hi rend="italic">Discourses</hi>, investigated by R.G. Jenkins in his <hi rend="italic">The
    Old Testament Quotations of Philoxenus of Mabbug</hi> (Leuven
    1989). Some proposals have been advanced to account for the
    differences between the text of Philoxenus' quotations and the
    Peshitta text. W.D. McHardy claimed that Philoxenus used the
    Peshitta text as it is known to us, but quotes in a loose, free
    manner, while M.M. Winter argued that Philoxenus possessed a
    Philoxenian version of Sirach when he wrote the
    <hi rend="italic">Discourses</hi>. These proposals will be evaluated in the
    light of Jenkins' study. Also other explanations will be
    reviewed.<lb/>
    The present paper will further discuss the context of the
    quotations and address the question how the Sirach quotations
    function in the context of Philoxenus' argument and whether the
    context in which Philoxenus uses his quotations agrees with the
    context from which they are taken.</p>
         <p>Some observations will be made about the quotation of Sir.
    27:20 in Philoxenus' <hi rend="italic">Letter to the Monks of Senoun</hi> and
    about the absence of Sirach citations in other products of
    Philoxenus' literary creativity, including his commentaries,
    his theological and dogmatic treatises, and his numerous
    letters.</p>

    object of this study is to investigate the substantive elements
    which can elucidate the way in which the Peshitta to Chronicles
    was received and used in Syriac tradition. There is evidence to
    suggest that Chronicle's reception had a chequered history
    within the totality of the Syriac Churches, but it is necessary
    to be prudent before drawing hasty conclusions. There are at
    least three areas of investigation which can shed light on the
    book's canonicity: a) The Biblical manuscript tradition-that is
    to say, in which manuscripts and in what order are Chronicles
    to be found. We will mention complete Bibles, the so-called
    Massoretic MSS, lectionaries and the group of 'Nestorian
    Apocryphal Books'. b) Quotations of, or allusions to,
    Chronicles in Syriac patristic writings in contexts which show
    or suggest that the Peshitta to Chronicles is being used as
    Scripture-Aphrahat and Ephrem, among others, provide some
    interesting examples. c) The 'theoreticians' of canonicity: the
    presence or absence of Chronicles in the lists of books
    received as Scripture; seven examples will be mentioned. The
    intersection between these three areas could also be a fruitful
    field to be examined.</p>

    Thomson (1977) published two Syriac versions of the commentary
    of Athanasius on the Psalms, a shorter, abridged version and a
    longer version. This version is taken from the manuscript BM
    Additional Manuscript 14568. This manuscript dates from 597
    C.E. This text is a translation of a Greek original. It
    predates the Syro-Hexaplaric translation of the Old Testament.
    In the Greek original references to the Bible are according to
    the LXX. The question is what text did the translator use for
    his Biblical references. Did he translate the references from
    the Greek manuscript of the commentary, did he use the
    Peshitta, or can one discern a combination of these two
    possibilities?</p>
         <p>In this study four versions of the references to the Psalms
    need to taken into consideration: the quotations in Athanasius,
    the reading of the Septuagint, the Peshitta and the Syriac
    version of the commentary. With regard to the references in the
    Greek version of the commentary, one must keep in mind that the
    whole Psalm is not quoted in the commentary, only a selection
    of references necessary for the comments made on the Psalm. It
    is clear that Athanasius used the LXX, but his text may contain
    unique variants, such as the plus at the beginning of the
    heading of Psalm 24(25). In this instance the heading in the
    Syriac commentary does not contain the plus. The Syriac
    commentary may add some of the portions omitted in the Greek
    commentary, such as the last part of Psalm 24(25):1. The Syriac
    may also agree with the Peshitta in instances where the
    Peshitta differs from the Greek, such as at the end of the
    first line of Psalm 24(25):2.</p>
         <p>It is clear that the references in the Syriac commentary
    display a variety of possibilities and each reference must be
    considered on its own. It is possible that the version of the
    Psalms reflects the translation of Philoxenus, or at least a
    related translation by the translator of the commentary.</p>
         <head>The Reception of the Peshitta Psalter in Bar Salibi's
    Commentary on the Psalms</head>
         <p style="text-align:left">

            <anchor xml:id="P29"/>[29] One
    of the notable and innovative features of Bar Salibi's
    Commentary on the Old Testament is its bifurcation: the first
    column he labels 'factual' and the second either 'factual and
    spiritual' or 'mixed.' The presentation of these separate
    commentaries in parallel synoptic columns is without precise
    precedent in the history of biblical interpretation. In
    addition to the basic division between factual and spiritual,
    Bar Salibi appears to have added another division, that between
    commentaries based on the Peshitta and those based on the
    Septuagint. Scholars have usually understood these two
    structuring principles to be related, that is, they have
    understood the factual commentaries to be based on the Peshitta
    and several of the spiritual commentaries, as Bar Salibi
    himself states, to be based on the Septuagint. J. C. J. Sanders
    argued that Bar Salibi selected the Septuagint as the basis for
    his spiritual commentaries because he considered the Peshitta
    to be a Jewish book. Werner Strothmann was more cautious,
    suggesting that Bar Salibi's choice of biblical versions for
    his factual and spiritual commentaries is a riddle that we are
    unable to solve.</p>
         <p>This paper studies several related aspects of the reception
    of the Peshitta Psalter in Bar Salibi's 'Commentary on the
    Psalms.' I will first review the evidence for the traditional
    scholarly position that Bar Salibi used the Peshitta for the
    factual commentary and the Syro-Hexapla for the mixed
    commentary on the Psalms. I will demonstrate that Bar Salibi
    made use of the Syro-Hexapla in a limited and partial way and
    that he did so not because of an ideological conviction but
    because of the use of this version in one of his sources.
    Although Bar Salibi did not explain his use of the biblical
    versions, he did include Moshe bar Kepha's 'Introduction to the
    Psalms' as a preface to his own commentary. In the final part
    of the paper I compare the theoretical discussion found in Bar
    Kepha's preface with the actual practice of Bar Salibi in his
    commentary.</p>

    of the problems that translators in the NEATSB project will
    come across sooner or later are obscure words for which the
    entries in the standard lexicons seem to be either
    approximations based on the context, or on the original Hebrew
    or Greek. It is comforting to realize that even Syriac writers
    who lived several centuries after the Peshitta was translated
    found certain words problematic. At the end of each question
    and answer section of the <hi rend="italic">Liber Scholiorum</hi> of Theodore
    bar Koni (end eighth century) is appended a list of the
    difficult words in that section of the Peshitta, with
    explanations. This paper seeks to assess their value, and to
    compare them with the approach of Jacob of Edessa, the earlier
    West Syriac writer.</p>

    Breviary (<hi rend="italic">sh<hi rend="underline">h</hi>imo</hi>) of the
    Syrian Orthodox Church found its form, as we know it today,
    certainly after the last Syriac translation of the Bible
    undertaken by Thomas of Harqel in AD 616. This means that the
    prayers and songs of the Breviary were finally collected and/or
    composed at a time when all six versions of the New Testament
    were in existence; namely the Diatessaron, the Old Syriac
    Gospels, the Peshitta, the Philoxenian, the Harklean, and the
    Syro Palestinian. One can see from the text and themes that the
    Breviary is clearly rooted in the Bible. The themes are related
    to the classical structure of the Breviary; namely seven
    prayers a day, dominated by prayers related to Mary, the
    Apostles and Saints, penitents and to the deceased. Each of
    these subjects refers to many biblical passages. While most of
    the biblical references allude to the Bible, only a small
    number are direct quotations.</p>
         <p>The question rises as to which biblical versions have been
    used in the composition of these prayers and chants, and in
    particular, how much the Peshitta has influenced the Breviary.
    This paper will try to throw some light on the question.
    Furthermore, it will deal with the development of the
    Peshitta's terminology in the Breviary. It will, however, only
    consider Gospel citations and allusions. Biblical references to
    the Old Testament and the rest of the New Testament are not
    taken into consideration. Also the work is based on the printed
    versions of the Breviary and does not consider the various
    number of manuscripts.</p>

    renewed emphasis on the importance of the contextual study of
    the Peshitta text has inevitably led to a welcome
    re-examination of the text traditions preserved in the writings
    of the Syriac Church Fathers, but the headings prefixed to the
    Peshitta Psalms provide us with a rare opportunity to examine
    the influence of the Fathers on the transmission of the
    biblical manuscripts themselves. The Peshitta Psalm headings
    are quite independent of the original Hebrew and later
    Septuagint Greek headings, and characteristically identify the
    specific circumstances of composition, or link the texts to
    events in Christ's life. The headings were not included in the
    Leiden edition of the Peshitta Psalter (1980), and
    Bloemendaal's important monograph (1960), which built upon the
    earlier studies of Vosté (1944) and Baethgen (1878), restricted
    itself to the East Syrian tradition (which proved to be
    dependent upon the exegesis of Theodore of Mopsuestia). The
    independent West Syrian tradition has remained relatively
    neglected, and it is this which this paper seeks to rectify. On
    the basis of a collation of the headings in all of the West
    Syrian Psalm manuscripts utilised in the Leiden edition, plus
    certain other manuscripts and printed editions, and a survey of
    the West Syrian exegetical tradition and in particular the
    exegesis of Daniel of Salah (fl. 541), the author hopes to
    outline the origins, development, and characteristic features
    of the West Syrian Psalm headings.</p>

    Starting with Psalm 110 and the Epistle to the Hebrews (ch. 7),
    the puzzling figure of Melchizedek has always struck the
    imagination: from unknown parentage, God-fearing even before
    Revelation, he seems to have descended from heaven, being a
    kind of divine manifestation or hypostasis. In the Syriac
    tradition and through typological exegesis, he gave rise to the
    formation of heretic movements. This was especially the case
    with John of Apamea, who developed a hierarchic cosmology,
    based on a plurality of consecutive emanations. Our paper is to
    show that this was based on a specific interpretation of
    Genesis 14. In the first place, it elucidated the name which
    Melchizedek attributes to God: <hi rend="italic">El 'Elyôn</hi>, derived from
    the epithet of God, <hi rend="italic">'ly</hi>, which was widely spread in the
    south-western Semitic area (Syriac and Arab desert). This was
    further combined with the definition of his creative function:
    He who is 'the possessor of heaven and earth'.</p>

    Although Syriac literature in its entirety reflects the various
    ways in which the Syriac Bible was read, understood, and used
    as a source of inspiration in the Syrian Christian communities,
    there is reason to single out the specific genre of biblical
    commentaries.<lb/>
    Biblical commentaries span the whole period of Syriac
    literature. Unlike most other compositions, they were created
    and used in close contact with contemporary biblical
    manuscripts, which both the redactor and reader must have had
    on their desk. Biblical commentaries, therefore, are the first
    field to which the student should turn to complement his or her
    study of biblical manuscripts.<lb/>
    After a brief survey of the existing commentaries, their
    distinctive features, and the state of the research, we will
    ask ourselves how the commentary tradition can be integrated
    into the field of Peshitta studies. Three avenues will be
    explored.</p>
         <list type="ordered">
            <item>First and foremost, the biblical quotations deserve to be
      studied. The data culled from the commentaries and critically
      arranged may in the future develop into a valuable
      <hi rend="italic">apparatus</hi> to the existing Peshitta edition.</item>
            <item>Despite the dominant position of the Peshitta, Syriac
      commentators throughout the ages were well aware of the
      existence of biblical versions different from the Peshitta.
      This awareness of the plurality of the biblical text not only
      led them to incorporate into their commentaries readings from
      versions of Jewish and Greek Christian origin, but also
      provided them with an intellectual framework for their views
      on the origin and development of the Bible in various
      cultural traditions.</item>
            <item>The commentaries reflect the cultural and ecclesiastical
      diversity of Syrian Christianity. However, in the course of
      the centuries, the East and West Syrian traditions gradually
      came closer to each other and to a certain extent adopted
      each other's interpretations and approaches.</item>
         </list>
         <p>In addition to these observations, a few more general
    questions related to the Syriac commentary tradition will be
    touched upon, e.g. the definition of the genre, the
    relationship to non-Syriac biblical commentaries, and the
    <hi rend="italic">Sitz im Leben</hi> of the commentaries, with special
    attention to the schools and monasteries.</p>

    Researches on the Syriac Bible have rarely made use of the
    liturgical texts, with the exception of the Lectionaries. West
    Syrian anaphoras (more than 70), baptismal ordo (about a
    dozen), as well as other liturgical texts contain a large
    number of quotations from the Bible. Several of these texts or
    at least part of them belong to the first millennium
    (c.350-1000 AD).<lb/>
    The Bible quotations in the West Syrian Anaphoras can be
    classified into three groups:</p>
         <list type="ordered">
            <item>Quotations translated/adapted from the Anaphoras of Greek
      origin, especially Anaphora of Saint James.</item>
            <item>Direct quotations or paraphrases from the Syriac Versions
      of the Bible.</item>
            <item>Quotations or paraphrases borrowed from patristic texts,
      either composed in Syriac or translated into Syriac.</item>
         </list>
         <p>The central part of the anaphora
    (Sanctus-Institution-Anamnesis-Epiklesis) needs particular
    attention, as it is the oldest stratum, which remained rather
    less modified.</p>
         <p>Several Bible quotations reached Syriac Anaphoras through
    the Syriac version of Saint James. Greek Saint James quotes
    from LXX and the Greek NT, often without much alteration. Some
    of the quotations of Greek St James seem to have been borrowed
    from the so-called 'Clementine Liturgy' of the Apostolic
    Constitutions.</p>
         <p>The West Syrians have made a literal translation of Greek St
    James with its Bible quotations. They have rarely made attempts
    to correct the quotations to make them conform to the Peshitta
    or the Harklean Versions. Thus in a few pre-tenth century
    anaphoras, the prayers of Saint James (with the Bible
    quotations) were often quoted directly or were simply
    paraphrased.</p>
         <p>The anaphoras that were originally composed in Syriac gives
    more or less accurate quotations from the Peshitta, Harklean,
    Old Syriac and other unidentified versions. However, Saint
    James served as the model for quoting the Bible. Thus we can
    find a tendency to conflate different Bible passages. The
    Institution narrative is an example of mixing elements from
    different NT passages.[Eg. 1 Cor.11; Institution Narratives in
    the Synoptic Gospels, and the accounts of the multiplication of
    the bread]. Later anaphoras borrowed phrases from anaphoras
    translated from Greek. This makes the text-critical assessment
    of the quotations a rather difficult task.</p>

         <p>Dear Colleagues,</p>
         <p>It is a distinctive honour to the Peshitta Institute to
    inform you about the progress of the Peshitta Programme.</p>
         <p>Looking back at the past three years of the Peshitta
    programme, the following remarks are to be made about parts III
    and IV. In 1998 Vol. IV/2, the books of Chronicles, has been
    published. The publishing of Volume IV/4, containing Ezra
    Nehemia and I+II Maccabees, has first priority now. The
    schedule for this volume is that preparations for printing will
    be finished in the end of this year, and that it will appear in
    Spring 2002. A substantial portion of the text of volume III/2
    (containing Jeremiah, Lamentations, the epistles of Jeremiah
    and Baruch, and the book of Baruch) is almost ready for
    printing. The same holds true for Vol. IV/1, containing Ruth,
    Susanna, Esther, Judith and Ben Sirah, though we cannot keep
    secret that portions of the collations still need verification.
    Moreover, the copy for one of the smaller books of this volume
    is still wanting. For the moment the publishing of volume IV/5,
    containing 3+4 Maccabees and the Odes of Solomon, has low
    priority. Anyway, the editor for this volume has not yet
    finished his work.</p>
         <p>Some years ago, after consultation of Dr. S. Brock, it was
    decided to add an extra volume to the Editio Major. This volume
    will contain collations of the MSS from the 13th - 15th century
    (perhaps some 16th century MSS will also be included), addenda
    and corrigenda. In the near future the Peshitta Institute will
    invite participants in the project of the Editio Major to
    deliver their collations for this period, as far as they have
    not yet done this. If necessary for the preparation of this
    volume as well as for the revision of the Preliminary List and
    its subsequent official edition, we will request to return the
    films that were given in loan.</p>
         <p>In the meantime much work has been done for the fifth part
    of the edition, that is the Concordance. We hope to publish the
    second volume next year. On their request Dr. W. Th. van
    Peursen has joined the present General Editors, Professor P.G.
    Borbone and Dr. K.D. Jenner. Dr. Van Peursen had been
    recommended for his expertise and qualifications in linguistic
    and computer assisted studies in the field of Semitic
    languages.</p>
         <p>As preparations for the scholarly Edition of the Peshitta
    commenced under the aegis of IOSOT, it had already become an
    accepted presumption that Syriac commentatory and liturgical
    literature might provide additional and text-critically
    relevant data for the establishment of the text. Time was not
    yet ripe then, however, to commence a broad, thourough and
    systematic study of the reception of the Syriac Bible. In the
    meantime a number of scholars have undeniably proved the
    importance of this material. The studies in question, however,
    were still concerned with isolated details and remained
    restricted to smaller portions of the text. Recently, Dr. R.B.
    ter Haar Romeny has made an extensive pilot study of the
    commentatory literature and has irrefutably affirmed the
    previous presumptions. Thus, on mature deliberation, the
    Peshitta Institute has come to the conclusion that time is ripe
    now to make concrete the intention of the late Professor P.A.H.
    de Boer and Dr.W. Baars. In line with this conclusion the
    present General Editors, Dr. K.D. Jenner and Professor A. van
    der Kooij, have planned to add a sixth part to the text
    edition, containing the data from the sources in question. They
    have invited Dr. R.B. ter Haar Romeny to share in the
    responsibility for this part of the text edition, since he is
    an internationally acknowledged expert in this field, and last
    but not least knows the ins and outs of the edition and
    programme in progress.</p>

    Reception will be of great help for two other projects: the New
    English Annotated Translation of the Syriac Bible, and the
    Editio Critica. In line with the ackowledgement of the first
    project by IOSOT at the Business Meeting in Oslo (1998) the
    Peshitta Institute started inviting scholars recommended by the
    General Editors of this project. The invitation is done on the
    basis of a sample that has been prepared by Dr. A. Salvesen.
    Inviting participants is still in progress. Meanwhile Dr. ter
    Haar Romeny has joined the present General Editors, Dr. K.D.
    Jenner, Professor J. Joosten and Dr. A. Salvesen; he will
    assist them with regard to the Syriac commentatory and related
    literature. Dr. G. Greenberg has been invited to take care for
    the uniformity of the English translation and has thus joined
    the Editorial Board.</p>
         <p>After due consideration the Peshitta Institute came to the
    conclusion that the planned Editio Minor should not present the
    BTR type of text as in the Editio Major. There are strong
    arguments now to establish a critical text and to make the
    Editio Minor an Editio Critica. Consultation of Dr. A. Juckel
    from Münster made clear that it is to be preferred to combine
    the critical minor editions of OT and NT. Activities regarding
    the OT will be co-ordinated by Leiden and those related to the
    NT by Münster. For the present the doctors Ter Haar Romeny,
    Jenner, Juckel and Van Peursen are acting as General Editors
    for the intended edition.</p>
         <p>In the meantime the Peshitta Institute made preparations for
    a project on linguistic and syntactical study of the Peshitta.
    This project, the <hi rend="italic">Computer Assisted Linguistic Analysis of
    the Peshitta</hi> (CALAP), has started in cooperation with the
    Free University of Amsterdam. The participants in this project
    are Drs. J.W. Dyk, P.S.F. van Keulen, and W.Th. van Peursen and
    Mr. C.J. Sikkel. Dr. K.D. Jenner and Prof. E. Talstra supervise
    this project which is financially supported by the Netherlands
    Organization for Research.</p>
         <p>As you may have noticed, the past period four volumes of the
    Monographs of the Peshitta Institute Leiden have appeared.
    Recently Dr. R.B. ter Haar Romeny has been appointed Executive
    Editor, and the scope of the series has been broadened as may
    be clear from the added sub-title: <hi rend="italic">Studies in the Syriac
    Versions of the Bible and their Cultural Contexts</hi>. To be
    clear: the series will thus be open for studies on the Syriac
    NT as well. Last but not least we may draw your attention to it
    that this series will also include the edition of the text and
    annotated translation of Jacob of Edessa's Revised Bible.
    Anybody who intends to publish a similar work in the Monographs
    of the Peshitta Institute is invited to consult Dr. Ter Haar
    Romeny.</p>
         <p>Last but not least I may draw your attention to the
    activities regarding the collection of xeroxes of publications
    on the Syriac Bible and the large collection of films of Syriac
    biblical and related manuscripts in the Peshitta Institute. We
    try to get digitized not only the xeroxed publications but also
    the films. Together with bibliographical data, surveys of
    biblical references in studies o the Syriac bible and Syriac
    liturgy these digitized collections will form the so-called
    Peshitta Database. Yesterday Mr. Keath Healy and I have
    discussed the possibilities with regard to digitize the
    manuscripts and in the near future Dr. Kiraz and I will consult
    each other as to digitalizing the xeroxed publications. In the
    meantime you may have noticed that the Peshitta Institute
    presents the bibliographical references to recent publications
    on the Syriac bible and its cultural and liturgical context to
    the Executive Editor of the Journal of the Aramaic Bible.</p>
         <p>With all good wishes,<lb/>
    yours sincerely,</p>

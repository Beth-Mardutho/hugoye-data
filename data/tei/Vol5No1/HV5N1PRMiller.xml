         <p>
            <anchor xml:id="P1"/>[1] Isaac the Syrian,
    or Isaac (Ishaq) of Nineveh, was a remarkable writer in a
    remarkable but largely neglected tradition of East Syriac
    writers. Many civilizations have experienced lamentably brief
    periods of intellectual florescence, golden moments, where
    great works of genius were produced: fifth and fourth century
    Athens, first century BCE Rome, the Song dynasty in China,
    Elizabethan England, to name a few. The reasons why these
    moments occurred are very difficult to discover, perhaps
    because of the great complexity of historical, sociological,
    and cultural factors at work. But mankind is much the richer
    for their having occurred. Isaac stands at the head of an
    intellectual florescence of the Syriac speaking culture in the
    seventh and eighth centuries of what is now Iraq, Iran, Kuwait,
    and Qatar. His writings had such irresistible force that within
    about one hundred years after his death many of them had
    crossed the nearly impenetrable (for Easterners) political and
    theological divide between Eastern Christianity and Western
    (that is, Byzantine and Roman) in Greek translation. It is a
    credit to mankind, I think, that works of genius eventually
    gain widespread recognition, even when they are imbued with
    cultural expression and concerns that may seem foreign to
    many.</p>
         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P2"/>[2] The
    complete works of Isaac are only now becoming available in
    translation, and so we should welcome Alfeyev�s introduction to
    Isaac�s thought. Alfeyev�s method is quite straightforward. He
    divides what Isaac writes into various subjects, e.g. prayer,
    humility, faith and knowledge, contemplation, and then adduces
    many passages where Isaac is allowed to express his views on
    these subjects. The result is that the reader obtains a rather
    good idea of these views and some taste of Isaac�s forceful
    style of writing. Perhaps this is the best method to use for an
    introduction to such a writer, but I feel it risks giving the
    impression that Isaac is a systematic writer. I think it can be
    argued that Isaac is a systematic thinker in the sense that his
    many views on many aspects of what is called the �spiritual�
    life (I use quotation marks because �spiritual� seems to have
    as many meanings as there are users of the term) are consistent
    with one another, but he does not treat his subjects in a
    systematic fashion. For the most part it is not the internal
    logic of the view that determines the course of his discussion,
    but the wealth of his personal experience and psychological
    insight. So reading Isaac is like venturing into the mind and
    life of a rather astonishing person. What one finds is not a
    carefully ordered treatment of subjects but a collection of
    views invested with the power of experience.</p>
         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P3"/>[3] Alfeyev
    seems to assume that we, readers living in the twenty-first
    century, will be able to make sense of and find interesting
    what Isaac writes about what he, as an ascetic of seventh
    century Persia, thinks is of greatest possible importance.
    Alfeyev seems to think that discussions of prostrations, rivers
    of involuntary tears, and awestruck states will attract our
    attention and we will not think that we are witnessing a form
    of lunacy. I mean to say that his introduction does not attempt
    to bridge the enormous gap between how ordinary people now
    think and lead their lives and how ancient Christian ascetics
    did so. There are, no doubt, deeply religious people nowadays
    who will not find Isaac�s thought-world foreign, but such
    people are few. What about the rest of us? This complaint is
    part of a larger one. Alfeyev�s introduction does not attempt
    to stand outside the ascetic tradition in order, for the
    reader�s benefit, to provide critical assessment of Isaac�s
    writings. Alfeyev tells us <hi rend="italic">what</hi> Isaac says, but not why
    and not how we should approach this foreign world. Isaac
    himself makes no efforts in this direction, but there is an
    evident reason for this. His books were meant for fellow
    ascetics, for people who devote their every effort to being
    physically and mentally disassociated from the world we know
    and to being physically and mentally joined to another, very
    different world. It is a kind of accident that we can pick up a
    copy of Isaac as we idle away hours in a local bookstore. I
    doubt very much that Isaac ever foresaw this and I am uncertain
    whether or not he would be pleased. But since this is our
    present reality, it would seem appropriate for an introduction
    to explain things which Isaac had no need to explain.</p>
         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P4"/>[4] So that
    my complaint not seem vacuous I shall briefly sketch a possible
    interpretative position that could help to form a bridge from
    our world to Isaac�s. Take the analogy of a tightrope walker.
    Thanks to years of training the tightrope walker is able,
    slowly and carefully, to walk on a rope stretched high above
    the earth. He regulates every movement, every breath, guards
    every thought from distraction and fear. The slightest wrong
    motion, which on the ground would have no negative effect at
    all, may cause sudden death, while speedy correction of tiny
    mistakes brings strong feelings of relief, joy, and hope. So
    the tightrope walker, when on his or her rope, lives, one may
    say, in a different physical and psychological world than we
    do, one subject to different laws. Why must this be the case?
    Because human beings do not naturally walk on ropes; to do so
    is to push our meager abilities to their absolute limit. The
    ascetic closely resembles a tightrope walker: he or she does
    what human beings are not naturally suited to do. To accomplish
    this requires enormous psychological and physical effort and
    considerable training by others. This life at the extreme, as I
    think it may be appropriately termed, has its own dangers, its
    own laws, its own joys and fears. These are dictated largely by
    the kind of life it is (that is, complete concentration on the
    exercise of one of the mind�s faculties, its �spiritual part�)
    and how human psychology works. Isaac just assumes he is
    talking to ascetics (tightrope walkers), and is telling them,
    among other things, that if you see <hi rend="italic">x</hi> and <hi rend="italic">y</hi>, then
    prepare yourself for <hi rend="italic">z</hi>. For example, �If you gain the
    grace of God and are deemed worthy to revel in the divine
    vision of God�s judgments � prepare yourself, yea, arm yourself
    against the spirit of blasphemy� (Isaac I.4.33)<ref target="#FN1">1</ref>. This instruction
    probably means little or nothing to most of us. We might even
    think that if Isaac is right, it shows that his version of the
    �spiritual life� is a kind of mental derangement. But we are
    not living at this particular extreme, or likely at any
    extreme; we do not know what is needed to remain alive and sane
    at this extreme. If we would like to know, at least
    vicariously, we should read Isaac, ever bearing in mind what he
    is and what we are.</p>
         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P5"/>[5] In
    general, Alfeyev does not try to explain Isaac�s views, but
    there are at least three exceptions that I noticed. Isaac is
    not a theological writer; he just assumes a particular
    christological position, that of the Church of the East, and
    works within this framework, making few, if any, christological
    statements. But christology, even today, is the source of the
    divisions among the Eastern Churches and so Alfeyev tries to
    situate and explain Isaac�s christological framework. This is
    helpful. But one would have wished for further discussion. For
    example, one might inquire whether or not the theological
    viewpoint of the Church of the East had any influence on
    Isaac�s ascetic views. I myself doubt that it did—apart from
    recommending the reading of certain patristic authors rather
    than others—, but if that is right, it seems to me to be a fact
    that says something significant about the nature of Isaac�s
    approach to the �spiritual� life.</p>
         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P6"/>[6] Second,
    Alfeyev gives a good treatment of what he calls �life in God,�
    that is, Isaac�s various discussions of the highest �spiritual�
    states (e.g. contemplation, wonder), which, for Isaac,
    constitute the goal and achievement of ascetic life. Here
    Alfeyev helpfully mentions the Evagrian tradition which Isaac
    continues. In fact, it is clear the Alfeyev has thought a good
    deal about this subject and I suspect the reader would wish to
    have been made privy to more of his thoughts on this, because
    what he says is insightful. Even so, I would like to question
    one claim that Alfeyev makes in the course of his discussion of
    �stillness of mind.� Here he asks, reasonably enough, �Is that
    complete cessation of intellectual activity which Isaac calls
    �stillness of mind� a migration beyond the borders of personal
    existence, a complete loss of personal self-awareness? No�
    (220). On what basis does Alfeyev answer �no�? He goes on to
    quote Isaac: �As soon as the governance and stewardship of the
    Spirit rule the intellect... then a man�s nature is deprived of
    its free will and is led by another guidance... and is not able
    to direct the movements of the mind� (I.23.118; cited ibid.).
    That someone is deprived of free will and cannot direct the
    movements of his or her mind strongly suggests that there is a
    significant loss of personal self-awareness. Perhaps this loss
    is not �complete,� but it seems to be a loss of the most
    important aspect of personhood, a cognitively directed will.
    Alfeyev then claims rather dogmatically that �on the contrary,
    in the stillness of mind there is an intense personal communion
    between a human person and a personal God� (221). Isaac never
    says such a thing, so we need an argument why this is entailed
    by what Isaac does say. No such argument is provided. One might
    argue, for example, that the christology of the Church of the
    East, more than all other christologies, emphasizes the
    survival of the human person when it is united with the Divine,
    and so if Isaac were to some degree guided by this christology
    when writing, it would be likely that he would deny that the
    person is lost while under the influence of the Spirit. But
    this argument would only demonstrate a likelihood and I suspect
    that Isaac is guided here by personal experience rather than by
    theological commitment. So what did Isaac think about this
    oft-discussed question? I do not think there is an easy answer.
    It is not even clear what Isaac would understand by the term
    �person,� thanks, to be begin with, to the subtle East Syrian
    distinctions between <hi rend="italic">parsopa</hi> and <hi rend="italic">qnoma</hi>.</p>
         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P7"/>[7] Finally,
    Alfeyev devotes the last chapter of his book to Isaac�s
    startling claims about God�s justice (�do not call God just�
    [I.51.250]), love, and the abolition of hell. This is the only
    properly theological subject Isaac discusses and here, rather
    uncharacteristically, he does so in the form of a protracted
    argument. Alfeyev, following his method, lets Isaac speak for
    himself, but he also goes at some length to explain Isaac�s
    position, perhaps partly in an attempt to make it seem less
    controversial. His treatment is good, but because Isaac
    presents an argument, it seems to me that the reader should
    have been presented more explicitly with the form of the
    argument, that is, what the premises are, how they are
    plausible, and how they entail the conclusion. This is, after
    all, a very significant claim. Furthermore, the fact that Isaac
    resorts to rational argument is quite interesting. It is rather
    clear, I think, that Isaac is not being philosophical, he is
    not, as Socrates says, �following the argument� (<hi rend="italic">Phaedo</hi>
    107b7). Isaac has become convinced of the truth of his claim
    not by argument but by some other means, but because the claim
    is controversial, he sets out an argument for our sake, so that
    <hi rend="italic">we</hi> might be persuaded. And persuaded we should be.</p>
         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P8"/>[8] In
    connection to the discussion of hell (gehenna) I have one
    further complaint. Alfeyev says, I think incautiously, that
    �gehenna is a sort of purgatory rather than hell� (290). I see
    no reason for such a suggestion. To say that gehenna is a kind
    of purgatory suggests precisely what Isaac wishes to deny
    because it assumes that the suffering of the few that are
    committed, however briefly, to gehenna makes them better,
    cleanses them. As far as I can see Isaac never claims that
    punishment is necessary for certain beings, or that suffering
    is somehow a good, be it an intermediate good. What Isaac does
    claim is that gehenna is a �matter of mercy� like the Kingdom
    (II.39.172.22; quoted p.291.) and that it is part of God�s
    eternal plan. Why this is the case Isaac does not claim to
    know, but intimates only that perhaps it is a kind of pretext
    for a further manifestation of God�s �immense grace that, like
    an ocean, knows no measure� (II.40.177.13).</p>
         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P9"/>[9] But
    putting aside the small complaints just elaborated, I think
    that Alfeyev�s book is a good and useful introduction to
    Isaac�s thought. We should wish that he will say more in
    future.</p>_______<lb/>

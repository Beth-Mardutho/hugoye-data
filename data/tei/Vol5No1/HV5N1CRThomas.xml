            <anchor xml:id="P1"/>[1] The
    Fourth Woodbrooke-Mingana Symposium on Arab Christianity and
    Islam was held from 12 to 16 September 2001. Like its three
    predecessors, it was organised at Woodbrooke Quaker Study
    Centre, Selly Oak, Birmingham, where Alphonse Mingana, the
    Iraqi scholar whose memory it seeks to preserve, once lived.
    Its theme was "Arab Christianity in Iraq in the `Abbasid Period
    (750-1258)".</p>
         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P2"/>[2] In all,
    23 scholars, researchers and interested individuals attended
    the Symposium. These came from Europe, the USA and the Middle
    East, and included some of the leading scholars on the subject
    of Arab Christianity. In addition to experienced and recognised
    experts in the field, there were a number of postgraduate
    students and researchers, some of whom were making their first
    public presentations of their research. We were also honoured
    by the presence of Mar Gregorios Saleba Shimoun, the Syriac
    Orthodox Archbishop of Mosul, Iraq, whose journey had involved
    two days overland travel before flying to England from
    Damascus. We were, however, deprived of three American
    colleagues and one Jewish colleague who were prevented from
    travelling by the aftermath of the September 11 attacks on
    Washington and New York.</p>
         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P3"/>[3] A total
    of 19 papers were read out to the gathering, those from the
    American colleagues unable to attend read by other
    participants. These papers ranged very widely, as the titles in
    the appended list show, and included three visual presentations
    alongside written papers. It is planned to publish a selection
    of them through Brill of Leiden, who also published papers from
    the preceding Symposiums.</p>
         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P4"/>[4] The
    Symposium took place in the year that the Centre for the Study
    of Islam and Christian-Muslim Relations marks its twenty-fifth
    anniversary. In recognition of this, the proceedings were
    opened with a public lecture by Professor Jacques Waardenburg
    in the Edward Cadbury Hall, and were concluded with a
    celebration dinner at the University's Edgbaston Campus, which
    was also attended by friends and associates of the Centre. The
    speaker at this dinner was Professor David Kerr, the first
    Director of the Centre.</p>
         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P5"/>[5] The
    costs of the Symposium, including accommodation for speakers
    and travel bursaries for some students, were assisted by grants
    from the British Academy, the Spalding Trust and the Edward
    Cadbury Charitable Trust. Additional grants towards the
    Archbishop of Mosul's travel were made by the al-Tajir World of
    Islam Trust and the Bishop of Birmingham's Charitable Trust.
    The Centre for the Study of Islam and Christian-Muslim
    Relations acknowledges these with deep gratitude.</p>
         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P6"/>[6] It was
    agreed by the Symposium participants that a fifth meeting
    should be held in four years' time, on the theme of the Bible
    in Arab Christianity. So scholars in the field of Arab
    Christianity and all who are interested are invited to gather
    once more at Selly Oak in September 2005.</p>

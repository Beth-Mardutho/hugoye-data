         <div type="abstract">
            <p>The bema, a raised platform located in the
    centre of the nave, was an important architectural and
    liturgical feature in the early East and West Syriac churches.
    However, there are many unanswered questions concerning the
    correlation between the archaeological remains and the
    liturgical importance of this structure, particularly in the
    East Syriac milieu. While the bema was considered integral to
    the early liturgy of the East Syriac church, little
    archaeological material independently confirms its importance.
    This paper will deal primarily with the East Syriac bema, and
    the discrepancies which exist between the written and
    architectural evidence.</p>

         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P1"/>[1] Until
    relatively recently the field of Syriac Christianity was marked
    by a notable dearth of archaeological information. One of the
    more unfortunate results of this lack of material was a
    tendency on the part of earlier scholars to assign the majority
    of early Syriac structures to broad categories, taking little
    note of regional architectural variation or its significance.
    While great strides have been made over the last fifty years in
    further defining the various regional traditions in
    architecture and liturgical furnishings within the West Syriac
    Church, less work has been instigated in the field of East
    Syriac Christianity. However, more archaeological evidence has
    begun to surface in the last twenty years and we must now
    reconsider the old material in terms of the new. Part of this
    task must include not only a reexamination of the architecture,
    but also its relation to the many written sources for the East
    Syriac liturgy. Only through such a discussion can we separate
    the physical structures from the ideal liturgy and understand
    how the two interact with one another.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P2"/>[2] This
    paper serves solely as a preliminary examination of the problem
    and therefore concentrates on only one aspect of the East
    Syriac church - the bema. This liturgical and architectural
    structure is found not only in the East Syriac tradition, but
    also within the contexts of West Syriac and Byzantine churches
    and many early synagogues. In short, it is a raised platform
    located in the nave (although the exact position varies),
    predominantly associated with the liturgy and used for
    readings, sermons and blessings. While its position,
    significance and composition vary geographically, it retains
    extremely significant symbolism in the East Syriac
    liturgy.<note place="foot" xml:id="#FN1" n="1">

             The best discussions of sources as they relate to
    the bema are found in Robert F. Taft, “Some Notes on the
    Bema in the East and West Syrian Traditions”
    (<hi rend="italic">OCP</hi> 34 [1968]), 326-359; idem., “On the Use of
    the Bema in the East-Syrian Liturgy” (<hi rend="italic">ECR</hi> 3

         </p>
                </note> Although the usage and symbolism of this
    structure is clearly expressed in many East Syriac sources, the
    interpretation of this material in relation to new
    archaeological finds leads us into some difficulty.<note place="foot" xml:id="#FN2" n="2">

             The term East Syriac in this paper refers to the
    Christian community living in the Sassanian Empire which is
    often given the misnomer "Nestorian". This is too limited a
    term, however, and does not take into account the regional
    variation or independent development of this community. Primary
    sources for the bema include the fifth century <hi rend="italic">Synodicon
    Orientale</hi> as well as the ninth century Thomas of Marga.
    For the former source, see J.B. Chabot, <hi rend="italic">Synodicon
    Orientale</hi> (Paris: Imprimerie Nationale, 1902), 28, 267-8;
    for the latter see E.A.W. Budge, <hi rend="italic">The Book of
    Governors</hi>, 2 vols. (London: Kegan Paul, Trench, Trubner,
    &amp; Co., 1893), vol. 1, 306; vol 2; 543. See also Taft, "Some
    Notes," 332-333. 
         </p>
                </note> While
    early East Syriac writing expresses an ideal liturgy involving
    the bema, it has now become increasingly difficult to correlate
    the written evidence with the archaeological remains.<lb/>
         </p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P3"/>[3] A
    framework for this discussion has already been established by
    Robert Taft, who initiated the consideration of the bema in the
    Syriac tradition.<note place="foot" xml:id="#FN3" n="3">

                </note> His comparison of both the written liturgical
    sources and the available archaeological data provides clear
    evidence for the separation of the two Syriac traditions. Taft
    also offers a strong analysis of the different architectural
    groupings within the geographically diverse West Syriac Church.
    In recent years much more work has been done on this latter
    group of churches, particularly by Pauline Donceel-Voûte.
    Her work is not only essential for understanding the liturgy of
    these structures in terms of the archaeology (and vice-versa),
    but also for illuminating the diversity which exists among the
    extant West Syriac churches.<note place="foot" xml:id="#FN4" n="4">

         </p>
                </note> More recently Erich Renhart has
    devoted an entire monograph to the bema, particularly as it
    relates to the West Syriac churches.<note place="foot" xml:id="#FN5" n="5">

    (<hi rend="italic">PdO</hi> 20 [1995]), 85-94 was recently brought to my
    attention, although I have not yet been able to consult it.
    Renhart and Donceel-Voûte discuss East Syriac sources
    extensively, but are geographically concerned with Byzantine
    Syria and Northern Mesopotamia.

                </note> Some work has also been
    started on the East Syriac corpus of churches, primarily by
    Yasuyoshi Okada.<note place="foot" xml:id="#FN6" n="6">

    (<hi rend="italic">al-Rafidan</hi> 12 [1991]), 71-83.  Okada has
    recognized the regional similarities of the churches in
    southern Iraq and the Persian-Arabian Gulf. 
         </p>
                </note> However, considerable work remains to be done on
    the East Syriac architectural corpus, which has expanded
    extensively over the last few years. The majority of these
    "new" churches are located in the formerly Sassanian-held lands
    of southern Iraq and in the Persian-Arabian Gulf. The
    architecture represented in these structures needs now to be
    reconsidered in relation to the liturgy. Thus, this paper is in
    no way an attempt to draw final conclusions, but is an initial
    discussion of the potential directions for future exploration
    in the field of East Syriac Christianity.<lb/>

         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P4"/>[4] In order
    to understand the framework Taft set out, we must look briefly
    at the appearance and significance of the bema in West Syriac
    church architecture.<note place="foot" xml:id="#FN7" n="7">

                </note> Previous to Taft's work, many assumptions
    were made about the uniform nature of the West Syriac
    tradition, based solely on the geographical area in which these
    churches are found. J.M. Fiey's "Syro-Jacobite" plan
    illustrates an example of the idealized layout of these
    churches in which the bema, often apsidal, is found in the
    centre of the nave [Figure 1].<note place="foot" xml:id="#FN8" n="8">
                    <p rend="footnote text">
             J.M. Fiey, <hi rend="italic">Mossoul Chrétienne </hi>
    (Beirut: Imprimerie Catholique, 1959), Plate III. This plan is
    based on both written and archaeological sources. Fiey did,
    however, note the variations which occurred in the
    architectural reality in both the East and West Syriac churches
    of Mossul. Ibid., 75, 98. Donceel-Voûte, <hi rend="italic">Les
    pavements,</hi> 513-514 illustrates some of the variations
    which occur within this corpus of churches. 
         </p>
                </note> However, in reviewing the
    architectural evidence Taft was able to delineate four
    geographical categories within each of which he found
    variations in the placement and use of the bema. He divided the
    churches into four categories: north and northwest Syria; the
    region around southern Syria; the area around Osrhoene,
    including the Tur-Abdin; and Takrit. Of these, the bema occurs
    in the centre of the nave only in some of the churches of the
    first region (northern Syria) and in Takrit.<note place="foot" xml:id="#FN9" n="9">

         </p>
                </note> The churches located
    in the other two areas are more disposed towards a liturgical
    arrangement in which the bema was placed in the area in front
    of the sanctuary, often merging with the sanctuary as sacred
    space. This shift, which Taft links to the evolution of the
    sanctuary, also has implications for understanding the use and
    symbolism of the bema within the context of the West Syriac
    liturgy.<note place="foot" xml:id="#FN10" n="10">

    and West Syriac communities used the bema.

            <anchor corresp="P5"/>[5] The
    variation in the location of the bema is mirrored in the

                </note> Certainly the predominant sense is that the
    bema, while important as a platform for readings in the
    churches where it does occur, is less important for the overall
    symbolism of the West Syriac liturgy than for that of the
    East—something which is often reflected in a
    correspondingly smaller platform. Taft says: "Unfortunately the
    liturgical commentators of the Jacobite tradition have not
    provided us with the same wealth of detailed liturgical
    information as their Nestorian brethren. The ancient documents
    of the Antiochene tradition, both Greek and Syriac, place the
    altar, throne and synthronon in the east end of the
    church."<note place="foot" xml:id="#FN12" n="12">

             Ibid., 351. This arrangement would give to
    the bema the same significance as the ambo in the Byzantine
    rite. 
         </p>
                </note> This arrangement of liturgical furnishings
    takes away from the importance of the bema. As well, the actual
    physical bema is described as being in a variety of locations,
    including both the centre of the nave as well as in front of
    the sanctuary. The variation and the silence of some of the
    sources suggest that less spiritual significance is given to
    the bema in the Western tradition than in the Eastern one.
    However, in West Syriac sources from the East, the description
    of the bema suggests an importance which is generally applied
    only to the East Syriac tradition.<note place="foot" xml:id="#FN13" n="13">

    together, the literary and archaeological evidence suggest the
    following points. There was regional variation in the West
    Syriac size, shape and positioning of the bema. Generally the
    bema merged with the area in front of the sanctuary, and this
    location took on the symbolic significance of Jerusalem and
    Divine Instruction which we shall see in the East Syriac

    the liturgical tradition of the East Syriac Church, the

    become a somewhat problematic addition to this question. 
    Several more East Syriac churches have come to light from both
    the Iraqi mainland and the islands in the Persian-Arabian Gulf,
    and none of these structures provides any evidence for a bema.
    Yet the majority of these churches can be called East Syriac

    Archaeologically, the absence of the bema in one or two of
    these structures could, of course, be explained in practical
    ways.  It has been plausibly suggested by several scholars
    that these structures may have been made of wood. However this
    seems unlikely within the geographical context of such
    locations as the southern Iraqi desert. As well, extensive
    excavations of some of these structures—most notably at
    Failaka—have turned up fine plaster floors which do not
    exhibit any indication of either portable or permanent
    liturgical furnishings in the nave.<note place="foot" xml:id="#FN34" n="34">

    Because the written evidence indicates the significance of the
    bema in the liturgy of the East Syriac Church, it cannot be
    disregarded as an important part of the service. However, we
    must briefly explore the possible explanations for the absence
    of this structure in the region around and south of Hira. 
    There are a number of possibilities and it seems likely that
    they all impact on the final analysis. To begin with,
    Taft’s assertion that the bema in the early Christian
    tradition moved from west to east must hold some validity
    here;<note place="foot" xml:id="#FN36" n="36">
                    <p rend="footnote text">
             Taft, “Some Notes,” 358-9.
    
         </p>
                </note> nevertheless, its arrival in Mesopotamia is
    obscure. Further, two important questions remain unanswered:
    from how far and when did the bema enter the region? The
    presence of the bema in the West Syriac churches of the region
    around Antioch, which theologically had early connections to
    what became the Church of the East, may very well provide the
    initial link for the passage of this liturgical element to some
    of the eastern Christian churches. As well, the usage of a
    <hi rend="italic">bimah</hi>, or reader’s platform, in some of the
    synagogues in the region of Anatolia and Syria may provide the
    context for the initial adoption of this architectural
    aspect.<note place="foot" xml:id="#FN37" n="37">
                    <p rend="footnote text">
             One of many extant examples is found at
    Sardis. See A. Seager, “The Synagogue at Sardis” in
    <hi rend="italic">Ancient Synagogues Revealed.</hi> Lee I. Levine, ed.
    (Detroit: Wayne State University Press: 1982), 178-184. A
    convincing argument for the Jewish origins of the bema can be
    found in G. Rouwhorst, “Jewish Liturgical Traditions in
    Early Syriac Christianity” (<hi rend="italic">Vigiliae Christianae</hi>
    51 [1997]), 72-93. I am not convinced that the bema had to come
    to the Syrian and Mesopotamian population from a Christian
    context. In Syria and northern Mesopotamia, it could very
    plausibly have come from the Jewish architectural tradition.

    While this may serve as a connection where the bema does occur,
    it does not help with the problem of where it does not. 
    To begin with, these early East Syriac sites in Southern
    Mesopotamia and the Persian-Arabian Gulf are now widely
    considered to take their architectural elements not from the
    Byzantine tradition, but from the Mesopotamian corpus
    generally, and the Partho-Sassanian milieu
    specifically.<note place="foot" xml:id="#FN38" n="38">
                    <p rend="footnote text">
             In this regard, I strongly agree with Y.
    Okada’s assessment that the impetus for these church
    types must be local and contemporary. See particularly,
    “Early Christian Architecture,” 80-81. This idea
    was expressed earlier by Reuther, “Sasanian
    Architecture,” 564-565. 
         </p>
                </note> A variety of architectural elements, including

             Ibid. 
         </p>
                </note> Beyond this, the separation of
    the Sassanian Christian community from the Byzantine Empire
    meant that it had to turn inwards to find unique architectural
    techniques to express its own liturgy.  The fact that we
    have no literary evidence for the enactment of the liturgy in
    this specific region in the early period may be evidence for
    this, but it is difficult to argue <hi rend="italic">ex nihilo.</hi>

         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P14"/>[14] A
    further aspect to be considered is the separation of the Jewish
    and Christian communities in this region. While several
    architectural and even liturgical elements of the Byzantine
    church had their origins in earlier or contemporary synagogue
    architecture (elements which are also found in the West Syriac
    Church), the Babylonian church did not adopt structures in a
    similar way. The relations between the Jewish and Christian
    communities under the Parthian and Sassanian Empires were less
    than cordial. While the Christians received some converts from
    within this community, they were not as numerous as they were

    seem that overall the Christians of this tradition turned
    almost entirely to secular Sassanian architecture for their own
    structures.<note place="foot" xml:id="#FN42" n="42">

    There remains the question of date and its relation to the
    usage of the bema. Taft indicates that the last East Syriac
    commentary we have is dated to the ninth century, but that in
    the sixteenth century the ceremony of the adoration of the bema
    appears again in the East Syriac liturgy. He suggests that the
    bema fell into disuse under the Mongols in the fourteenth
    century.<note place="foot" xml:id="#FN43" n="43">

         </p>
                </note> However, as seen above, in the region around
    and south of Hira the bema  does not seem to have been in
    use at all. The fact that the slightly later East Syriac
    churches discussed above were still using the same early
    Mesopotamian architectural types - still without a bema –
    strongly suggests that the initial local tradition in southern
    Mesopotamia did not include this structure, and consequently
    that the liturgy was performed in a different way spatially to
    accommodate this absence.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P16"/>[16] In
    practical terms, we must also consider the usage of the East
    Syriac churches. The majority of the churches in Babylonia and
    the Persian-Arabian Gulf were associated with monastic
    complexes and, excepting the three large structures at Hira and
    Ctesiphon, were actually quite small. In the West Syriac
    tradition, both liturgically and geographically, no example of
    a monastic church has been found which contains the remains of
    a bema.<note place="foot" xml:id="#FN44" n="44">

         </p>
                </note> The size and usage of monastic churches surely
    dictated the format of the architecture. Much the same argument
    can be made for the small and isolated churches in Babylonia
    and the Persian-Arabian Gulf. Recently two monastic churches in
    Iraq—one at Sulaimaniya and one at Takrit—have been
    excavated, both of which possess the remains of a bema.<note place="foot" xml:id="#FN45" n="45">

         </p>

    Several secondary sources indicate that in the later churches
    of Mesopotamia the bema essentially merged with the
    <hi rend="italic">qestromã</hi>, or area in front of the
    sanctuary.<note place="foot" xml:id="#FN46" n="46">

                </note> There, the significance of the bema retained
    its importance within the liturgy. While the eventual
    disappearance of this structure in the region is a matter of
    some debate, perhaps we should be looking more toward regional
    architectural differences for our explanation. While some of
    the more accessible churches north and west of Hira have this
    structure, none of the isolated ones to the south and east of
    this region seem to indicate any disposition towards it at all.
    Architecturally, the piers of all of the churches in the region
    around and south of Hira make it difficult to assume that a
    large square structure would have been placed in the center of
    the nave, so completely dividing it. Further, the absence of
    such a structure at Ctesiphon, the home of the Catholicos,
    serves to indicate that there was indeed an independent
    regional architectural style in Babylonia and the
    Persian-Arabian Gulf which remained unique, even in the face of
    increased influence from the Byzantine world.<note place="foot" xml:id="#FN47" n="47">

             When the controversy of Nestorius hit
    Byzantium, many of his followers went into honoured exile in

            <anchor corresp="P18"/>[18] The
    absence of the East Syriac bema in terms of its relation to
    both the liturgy and its sister structure in the West Syriac
    tradition is notable. What we do see is the development of an
    aspect of liturgical furnishing based in the local
    architectural corpus. Its absence suggests a new location for
    its inherent symbolism, one more connected with the layout of
    the local architectural traditions on which the rest of the
    structure depends. Further, the eventual disappearance of the
    bema from the East Syriac liturgical sources, and indeed
    structures, may have its roots in the absence of this structure
    in the early churches of southern Mesopotamia. Overall,
    however, this suggests that we must now attempt to define
    further regional differences in the East Syriac Church, both in
    regard to the architecture and in regard to the written
    liturgy.<lb/>

             The term East Syriac in this paper refers to the
    Christian community living in the Sassanian Empire which is
    often given the misnomer "Nestorian". This is too limited a
    term, however, and does not take into account the regional
    variation or independent development of this community. Primary
    sources for the bema include the fifth century <hi rend="italic">Synodicon
    Orientale</hi> as well as the ninth century Thomas of Marga.
    For the former source, see J.B. Chabot, <hi rend="italic">Synodicon

             One of many extant examples is found at
    Sardis. See A. Seager, “The Synagogue at Sardis” in
    <hi rend="italic">Ancient Synagogues Revealed.</hi> Lee I. Levine, ed.
    (Detroit: Wayne State University Press: 1982), 178-184. A
    convincing argument for the Jewish origins of the bema can be
    found in G. Rouwhorst, “Jewish Liturgical Traditions in
    Early Syriac Christianity” (<hi rend="italic">Vigiliae Christianae</hi>
    51 [1997]), 72-93. I am not convinced that the bema had to come
    to the Syrian and Mesopotamian population from a Christian
    context. In Syria and northern Mesopotamia, it could very
    plausibly have come from the Jewish architectural tradition.

             In this regard, I strongly agree with Y.
    Okada’s assessment that the impetus for these church
    types must be local and contemporary. See particularly,
    “Early Christian Architecture,” 80-81. This idea
    was expressed earlier by Reuther, “Sasanian
    Architecture,” 564-565. <ref target="#FNRef38">

    fascinating image of the Christian hierarchy imitating the

    provided the impetus for architectural borrowing (or
    vice-versa). <ref target="#FNRef42">

             When the controversy of Nestorius hit
    Byzantium, many of his followers went into honoured exile in
    the Eastern regions—where they encountered a vibrant and
    highly independent church. See S. A. Harvey,

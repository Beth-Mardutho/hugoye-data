            <p xml:lang="en">Dr. Yusuf Matto Ishaq, a Syriac
                scholar who published his works in Arabic and Swedish, passed away in Sweden at the
                age of ninety on July 5, 2021. </p>
            <p xml:lang="en">He was born in 1931 in Barṭella, a Christian town not far away from Mosul and from
                the monastery of Mār Mattai. In Mosul, he studied theology, liturgy, and above all
                Syriac language and literature at the Syriac Orthodox Seminary for ten years. He
                moved to Lebanon where he obtained in 1973 his Master’s degree in Arabic and other
                Semitic languages at the American University in Beirut. In 1979 he defended his
                doctoral thesis at the same university. His dissertation was entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">The chronicle of Zuqnin attributed to Dionysius of
                    Tell-Mahre</hi>, where he analysed its contents in light of other Syriac
                chronicles and Arabic medieval histories. He was the first modern scholar to
                concentrate on this important chronicle in East and West, offering insights based on
                especially comparative Arabic sources—the chronicle was written in 775/776, thus
                during the first decades of the Abbasid period. Unfortunately, the author did not
                publish his thesis, which is not easily accessible to scholars. </p>
            <p xml:lang="en">The attribution of the 8<hi rend="super">th</hi> century Chronicle
                of Zuqnin to the 9<hi rend="super">th</hi> century Syrian Orthodox
                patriarch Dionysius was not done by Dr. Ishaq but by Assemani, as early as the year
                1717. Attributions do not die easily, and thus Tullberg and Chabot in his French
                translation of part of the chronicle followed Assemani, but later on, Chabot
                realized the error of this attribution when he published the Syriac text in CSCO. </p>
            <p xml:lang="en">After teaching Hebrew at the Institute of Biblical Studies in Beirut between 1979 and
                1981, Dr. Ishaq left the Middle East for Sweden, as previously did the Christians of
                Ṭūr-‘Abdīn of eastern Turkey. The Swedish government wanted these immigrants to be
                taught their own language, along with Swedish, and thus Dr. Ishaq was the ideal
                person to write several educational books on ṭūrōyō to be used in educational
                schools. Between 1984 and 1992, he taught Arabic in various institutions, and at the
                same time worked among the ṭūrōyē and other people who were interested in the Syriac
                culture. He was the president and then vice-president of the Aramaic Cultural Centre
                for many years, a society whose mission was to advance studies on Aramaic-speaking
                people and their cultures. He at the same time published a magazine called the <hi
                    rend="italics">Echo of Knowledge</hi>, which contained article, some
                of which contained unique pieces of information about a variety of topics. Later on
                he published a selection of such articles in a book entitled <hi
                    rend="italics">al-manhal al-’adhb</hi> “the Sweet Source,” for the
                benefit of readers of Arabic. Some of the articles which are drawn on popular and
                written sources ought to be translated into English. </p>
            <p xml:lang="en">Besides translating books on Syriac into Arabic, including William Wright’s <hi
                    rend="italics">Short History of Syriac Literature</hi>, Dr. Ishaq
                embarked on translating some chronicles from Syriac into Arabic. One of these
                publications is the 6<hi rend="super">th</hi> century <hi
                    rend="italics">Edessan Chronicle</hi>, which he translated with lots
                of annotations in 2003. He was right to publish the Syriac text along with the
                translation, for the readership familiar with these two languages. His translation
                is accurate, and the annotations are worthwhile. He often referred to the Chronicle
                of Zuqnin, whose author used this Edessan Chronicle as a sources in his extensive
                opus. </p>
            <p xml:lang="en">Not too many scholars who master Syriac and Arabic could offer such interesting
                articles and books for Arab readership, especially nowadays when Syriac chronicles
                and others sources attract the attention of wide range of scholars, students, and
                other kinds readers. Thus the death of Dr. Ishaq will leaves a gap in this king of
                publications. </p>
            <p xml:lang="en">May he rest in peace. </p>

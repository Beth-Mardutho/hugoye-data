                <p xml:lang="en">The fourth-century Syriac corpus known
                    as the <hi rend="italic">Demonstrations</hi>, attributed to Aphrahat, the Persian
                    Sage, provides a unique window into the early development of Christianity among
                    Syriac-speaking communities. Occasionally these writings attest to beliefs and
                    practices that were not common among other contemporaneous Christian communities,
                    such as Aphrahat’s apparent belief in the “sleep of the soul” and the implications
                    of that belief for his concept of the soul-body relationship and what happens to the
                    soul and body at the resurrection. Aphrahat addresses this topic in the context of a
                    polemical argument against an unnamed opponent, which provides the occasion to
                    consider whom these arguments might be addressed against. The present article seeks
                    to understand Aphrahat’s views on the body and soul within the broad religious
                    milieu of the eastern Mediterranean world in Late Antiquity. The article concludes
                    with an argument for reading and understanding the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Demonstrations</hi> as a witness to the contested development of Christian
                    identity in the Syriac-speaking world.</p>

                        <p rend="footnote text"> It is not possible to determine Aphrahat’s precise
                            location from his writings. Demonstration 14 is addressed to the leaders
                            of the Church in Seleucia-Ctesiphon, but this does not provide any
                            concrete information for the author’s locale. The scribe of one late
                            manuscript (14<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> century) in the British
                            Library (BM Orient. 1017) claims that Aphrahat was the bishop of the
                            monastery of Mar Mattai (located in modern-day northern Iraq, near
                            Mosul). However, this claim is suspect and certainly anachronistic; cf.

                            the work of a single author, but rather an edited corpus. See Walters,

                    competing not only with well-established religions like Judaism, but also with
                    native folk religions, the influx of Greek philosophical schools, and various
                    expressions of Christianity.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn5" n="5">

                    </note> Despite this fascinating context, Aphrahat’s writings have received
                    surprisingly little attention as a witness to religious diversity in
                    fourth-century Persia. The little attention scholars have extended to his work
                    in this regard has been focused mainly on his depiction of Judaism. While
                    Judaism does feature prominently in several segments of Aphrahat’s <hi
                        rend="italic">Demonstrations</hi>, particularly in Demonstrations 11-22, his
                    writings also offer a unique perspective on the state of Christianity in early
                    fourth-century Persia. </p>
                <p>The present article seeks to offer an example of Aphrahat’s unique expression of
                    ideas and the way his thought fits within the broader religious milieu of early
                    Syriac-speaking Christianity, namely his beliefs about the body/soul
                    relationship and what happens to the body and soul at death and in the
                    resurrection. In his discussions of these topics, Aphrahat demonstrates both
                    continuity and discontinuity with other early Christian and Jewish sources, and
                    his unique perspective is likely the result of the diverse context in which
                    Persian Christianity developed. In particular, Aphrahat’s bipartite view of
                    humanity, the idea of the ‘sleep of the soul,’ and an idiosyncratic depiction of
                    the Holy Spirit’s role in conjunction with the body/soul in life, death, and the
                    resurrection provide a test case for examining the complex web of ideas that
                    shape the content of Aphrahat’s writings.</p>
                <p> Offering first a brief sketch of Aphrahat’s views on the body and soul
                    relationship, this article proceeds by comparing Aphrahat’s perspective to the
                    literature of various contemporaneous religious communities with which he could

                    comparison is, of course, Judaism, but this point merits caution. The literary
                    remains of Judaism for this time period are the writings of the Rabbis. Most of
                    these were compiled well after Aphrahat’s time of writing, yet some of them
                    reflect much earlier traditions. If Aphrahat was not familiar with proper
                    “Rabbinic” Judaism, as Jacob Neusner has argued,<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn6"

                            pp. 144-149. Most recently, Eliyahu Lizorkin has argued that Aphrahat

                            Para-Rabbinic Jews,” which seems in large part to overlap with Neusner’s

                            preserved, in Syriac, what are sure to be citations from Mani’s
                            followers and Manichaean literature. See John C. Reeves, “Manichaean

                    Christianity in the Syriac-speaking world in Aphrahat’s time period. Moreover,
                    there is evidence from within Aphrahat’s writings that he was aware of such

                    Aphrahat compares the event of baptism with the creation of humanity, and it is
                    here that he offers some insight into his views on the body/soul relationship.
                    The main point of comparison for the two events is the reception of the Holy

                    would be a rather surprising argument if that’s what Aphrahat intended. The

                    not necessarily tell us what Aphrahat had in mind when he used the phrase <foreign

                <p> That this is the case can be demonstrated in two ways: first, Aphrahat
                    associated this entity with a property that was characteristic of the soul in
                    ancient philosophical discussions of the body and soul: the capacity for sense
                    perception. Immediately following the comparison of creation and baptism,
                    Aphrahat asserted, “When people die, the <foreign xml:lang="syr">ܪܘܚܐ

                    bad servants who are sleeping: the bad servants do not sleep well and do not
                    wish to arise because they know that their master will punish them when they do
                    wake up. The good servants, however, sleep soundly, knowing the rewards that
                    await them. Aphrahat concluded the analogy thus: </p>

                    period of death before the resurrection. Aphrahat argued that when the

                <p> Aphrahat’s distinction between the “righteous and unrighteous” in death and at
                    the resurrection raises the question of what qualifies a person to be called
                    “righteous.” In Aphrahat’s estimation, each person must maintain the purity of

                        <p rend="footnote text"> When speaking of this Spirit, Aphrahat varied the
                            terminology he employed. He often used the phrases “Holy Spirit,”
                            “Spirit of Christ,” “Spirit of God,” and just “Spirit”
                            interchangeably.</p>

                    and their soul and body are buried, the portion of the Holy Spirit that dwelled
                    in that person from the time of baptism returns to its place with Christ and
                    testifies either for or against the body it inhabited based on whether or not
                    that person “guarded [it] in holiness.”<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn34" n="34">

                <p> This particular argument is intriguing for the perspective it offers regarding
                    Aphrahat’s view of the body/soul relationship. While Aphrahat believed in a
                    bipartite human existence (with no distinction between a human ‘soul’ and
                    ‘spirit’), he argued nevertheless that baptized Christians have a tripartite
                    existence: body, soul, and (Holy) spirit. He even implies that this portion of
                    the Holy Spirit that returned to be with God maintained some sense of the
                    individual identity of each person with whom it was associated. This is
                    presumably how Aphrahat reconciled his understanding of the sleep of the soul
                    after death with an assumed belief that the righteous would be in the presence
                    of Christ immediately upon death.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn35" n="35">
                        <p rend="footnote text"> As Aphrahat argued, “The [Holy] Spirit returns to

                    sleep of the soul against those who were claiming that people experienced either
                    reward or punishment immediately upon death: “Those with childish minds say, ‘if
                    no one has received a reward, why did the apostle say, “When we depart from the

                <p> The short discussion provided above offers an overview of Aphrahat’s language
                    and view of the soul/body relationship and of what will happen to the body and
                    soul in death and at the resurrection. We may isolate at least three unique
                    features of Aphrahat’s views: the origin of the soul from the breath of God, the
                    concept of the sleep of the soul, and the Holy Spirit’s role in the life of the
                    baptized Christian and in the resurrection. Aphrahat’s distinct perspective
                    emerges more clearly when juxtaposed with the views on such matters among
                    contemporary religious communities. </p>

                <head>The Breath of God and the Soul of Humanity</head>
                <p>Among various religious groups of late antiquity, many different competing
                    interpretations of the creation narrative circulated. Thus it is not surprising
                    that the subject of the soul in Gen 2:7, one of the key Scriptural passages for
                    Aphrahat’s argument, was the subject of multiple interpretive traditions in a
                    range of other authors and texts. The hermeneutical conclusion that the breath
                    of God actually became the soul of humanity is at least as old as Philo of
                    Alexandria, who argued in his work <hi rend="italic">On the Creation</hi> that
                    “the soul originated from the Father and ruler of all, for that which [God]
                    breathed into [humanity] was nothing other than Divine breath.”<note

                        <p rend="footnote text"> There is significant debate concerning the dating
                            of Targum Onqelos, particularly over the question of the existence of a
                            ‘proto-Onqelos’ known in Palestine, which would then suggest a two-stage
                            composition for the Targum with the first stage taking place in the
                            first two centuries of the common era and the second stage taking place
                            in Babylonia by the end of the fourth century. For a concise summary of
                            the scholarly question on this matter, see Paul V.M. Flesher and Bruce
                            Chilton, <hi rend="italic">The Targums: A Critical Introduction</hi>
                            (Leiden: Brill, 2011), 83-87 and 109-129. Other scholars argue for an
                            even more specific date for the final edit in the third century based
                            upon the evidence of the masorah, which is dated to the first half of
                            the third century; see Bernard Grossfeld, <hi rend="italic">The Targum

                            Targum Yerushalmi) is even more difficult because there are clearly
                            elements that are post-Islamic (see Flesher and Chilton, <hi
                                rend="italic">The Targums</hi>, 88). However, this does not suggest
                            that the whole Targum was composed after the advent of Islam, as it is
                            more likely that some passages simply represent a late redaction. While
                            it appears that Pseudo-Jonathan is reliant upon Onqelos, it is also
                            apparent from an examination of Targumic citations in the Palestinian
                            Talmud that both Onqelos an Pseudo-Jonathan were known to Rabbis by the
                            fifth century at the latest; see Flesher and Chilton, <hi rend="italic"

                            treatment of the dating of Pseudo-Jonathan, with argues also for a late

                    </note> However, as with Aphrahat, it is not immediately clear that this is a
                    reference to the soul because the Targumim state that the breath of God became a

                    senses of sight and sound. Thus, although it is clear that the Targum
                    translations relate the capacities of the senses to the רוחא that resulted from
                    the breath of God, it is necessary to explore the Rabbinic tradition more widely
                    in order to establish that the soul is the intended subject here.</p>

                    that the breath of God became the soul of humanity. Yet it also adds a layer of
                    linguistic difficulty because it employs the term נשמה for soul. That multiple
                    Hebrew and Aramaic words could be used in Rabbinic literature for the concept of
                    ‘the soul’ is likely a result of the fact that the Hebrew Bible itself employed
                    a range of words for the soul. Indeed, the editor(s) of <hi rend="italic"

                            this essay comes from J. Theodor, <hi rend="italic">Bereschit Rabba, 3

                <p> The exegetical principle that can be derived from this passage from <hi
                        rend="italic">BerR</hi> is as follows: 1) these five words were used
                    interchangeably for the concept of the human soul, as demonstrated by the
                    passages mentioned; 2) one of these five words was used to speak of the “breath”
                    of God; 3) therefore, each of these words could refer either to the breath of
                    God or to the human soul. If there were any doubt that this was the guiding
                    principle at work here, it is made explicit just a few lines later in the
                    context of the discussion of the phrase <foreign xml:lang="heb">חיה לנפש האדם ויהי</foreign> (“And Adam became a

                <quote>R. Samuel, the son-in-law of R. Hanina, the colleague of the

                    text the <foreign xml:lang="heb">נשמה</foreign> is equated with רוח (Gen 7:22). How do we know that the statement
                    of the one text is applicable to that of the other and vice versa? Because חיים
                    is written in both texts, proving that they are analogous (<hi rend="italic"

                <p> The Rabbis were not the only ones who preserved a tradition of the breath of God
                    becoming the soul of humanity. This concept also appeared in various texts from
                    other early Christian communities. Irenaeus of Lyon, for example, stated that
                    “the breath of life that came from God” animated Adam and bestowed upon him the
                    capacity for reason.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn52" n="52">

                    century because the codices that contain these texts are dated to the middle of
                    the fourth century.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn57" n="57">

                            against the gnostics, and he quotes from it extensively.</p>
                    </note> Thus, even though we cannot date these texts precisely, we can say that
                    these ideas were circulating in various texts by at least the first half of the
                    fourth century, which is also the precise date range of Aphrahat’s writings.
                    Based on the evidence provided by Rabbinic materials, various early Christian
                    writings, and Aphrahat himself, we can quite confidently conclude that there was
                    a well-established, yet malleable interpretative tradition of associating the
                    breath of God in the creation story of Genesis with the origin of the human
                    soul. It is certainly not necessary to claim that Aphrahat knew of or used any
                    of these texts as “sources” for his own argument, but this broader literary
                    context allows us to consider Aphrahat’s ideas as part of a complex interpretive
                    tradition that spans a large geographic and ideological range.</p>

                <p>While it is relatively easy to adduce potential parallels from other writers that
                    can be compared fruitfully to Aphrahat’s interpretation of Gen 2:7, it is quite
                    difficult to contextualize Aphrahat’s argument in favor of the “sleep of the
                    soul.” This concept is not prevalent in early Christian interpretations of death
                    and the resurrection, and it is difficult to find points of exegetical
                    comparison because Aphrahat does not necessarily link the idea of the sleeping
                    soul to a specific passage of Scripture. While some Jewish writings<note

                <p>There is one Rabbinic text that might suggest a belief in the “sleep of the
                    soul,” but the broader Rabbinic tradition complicates this text and makes it
                    difficult to conclude that it represents the position of the Rabbis more
                    generally. The text in question, also from <hi rend="italic">Bereshit
                        Rabbah</hi>, offers an exegesis of Abraham’s death (Gen 25:8) that brings up
                    the topic of a righteous person’s knowledge of the reward to come before death,
                    which results in a pleasant experience of death. The specific passage from this
                    text for the present topic is: “The entire reward of the righteous is kept ready
                    for them for the hereafter, and the Holy One, blessed be He, shows them while
                    yet in this world the reward He is to give them in the future; their souls
                    (<foreign xml:lang="heb">נפשם</foreign>) are then satisfied and they fall asleep (ישינים).”<note place="foot"

                    mention of souls, that this passage represents a belief in the sleep of the
                    soul. The parashah continues by offering the metaphor of a king who invited his
                    guests to view the meal they would eat, after which the guests, so satisfied by
                    what they had seen, fell asleep peacefully.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn61"

                            before death, and even uses the same passage as a cross reference (Prov.
                            31:25), but the reference to sleeping souls is entirely absent; S.M.

                    associate this passage with a doctrine of soul sleep, this is not a necessary
                    conclusion, given that sleep-terminology is frequently employed as a metaphor
                    for death in the Hebrew Bible.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn62" n="62">

                <p> Although there are several texts that could be used to demonstrate this point,
                    perhaps the clearest statement of the Rabbinic position on what happens to the
                    soul/body relationship at death appears in the Talmud in tractate <hi
                        rend="italic">Berakoth</hi>:</p>
                <quote>When one wakes he says: ‘My God, the soul that you placed in
                    me is pure. You fashioned it in me, you breathed it into me, and you preserve it
                    within me. And one day you will take it from me and then restore it to me in the
                    time to come. So long as the soul is within me I give thanks unto you, O Lord,
                    my God, and the God of my fathers, Sovereign of all worlds, Lord of all souls.
                    Blessed are you, O Lord, who restores souls to dead corpses.’ (<hi rend="italic"
                        >bBer</hi> 62b)</quote>
                <p>This passage explicitly states that the soul will be taken from the body
                    (presumably at death) and that it will be restored in the “time to come.”
                    Perhaps in order to emphasize that death is the moment at which the separation
                    takes place, the passage continues by stating that souls are restored to “dead
                    corpses.” Moreover, in addition to this text, we may also refer to the Rabbinic
                    distinction between what will happen to the souls of the righteous and the souls
                    of the wicked, which presupposes that souls will be separated from bodies at
                        death.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn63" n="63">

                    support of the sleep of the soul being an idea known among the Rabbis, the
                    broader Rabbinic tradition shows that such a view was not widely known or
                    accepted. Moreover, even if the text from <hi rend="italic">BerR</hi> is
                    representative of an earlier strand of Rabbinic thought that did, in fact,
                    support belief in the sleep of the soul, it is not necessary to conclude that
                    Aphrahat was aware of this interpretive tradition because Aphrahat’s
                    hermeneutical framework for soul sleep has virtually nothing in common with that
                    of <hi rend="italic">BerR</hi>.</p>
                <p> The doctrine of the sleep of the soul does not appear to have been prevalent
                    among early Christian writers, though Tatian and Origen provide limited data to
                    show that this idea circulated among at least some early Christians. In his <hi
                        rend="italic">Oratio ad Graecos</hi>, Tatian argued that some souls
                    (specifically the souls that are “ignorant of the truth”) “dissolve with the
                    body” (<foreign xml:lang="gr">λύεται μετὰ τοῦ σώματος</foreign> ), and
                    that these souls would rise again with the body for eternal punishment.<note

                    “ignorant of the truth” and those who attain “union” with the divine Spirit; the
                    souls of the latter are not buried with the body because they are led to heaven

                    </note> Thus, Tatian’s concept of the sleep of the soul exhibits at least one
                    major difference from Aphrahat, who teaches that all souls will be buried with
                    their bodies, but that the righteous souls/bodies would be transformed after the
                    final judgment. Origen explicitly rejects the idea that the soul remains with

                <head>Body and Soul in the Resurrection</head>
                <p>One of the most significant, yet easily overlooked, aspects of Aphrahat’s
                    treatment of the resurrection is that it was accompanied by an apparent polemic
                    against an unnamed opponent who taught a different doctrine of the resurrection.
                    According to that opponent, there would be a resurrection, yet the body itself
                    would not be raised. Although Aphrahat does not name this opponent explicitly,
                    there are two clues that can, perhaps, provide some details about their
                    identity. First, Aphrahat mentioned explicitly that the alternative teaching on
                    the resurrection derived from a misinterpretation of the words of Paul in 1 Cor
                        15.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn72" n="72">

                            passages are discussed in more detail below. It is of course <hi
                                rend="italic">possible</hi> that Aphrahat is dealing with a Jewish
                            opponent who had read Paul, but this is unlikely for several reasons:
                            First, specific issues pertaining to Judaism only arise in the second
                            set of Demonstrations (11-22), not in Demonstrations 1-10. Second, when
                            Aphrahat is addressing a Jewish opponent in Demonstrations 11-22, he
                            does so explicitly. There is no discernable reason that he would be coy
                            about addressing Jews here if in fact they provided the alternative
                            point of view. Third, the interpretation of 1 Corinthians 15 is known to
                            have been contested among various Christian groups. As a result, the
                            simplest historical explanation for Aphrahat’s context is a rival
                            Christian interpretation. In the absence of any explicit or implicit
                            reference to a Jewish opponent, the simplest explanation here (a
                            non-Jewish opponent) seems to be the best explanation. Finally, it seems
                            unlikely that any Jews of Aphrahat’s time period would have disagreed
                            with Aphrahat on the topic of a bodily resurrection. See, for example,
                            “Benediction 2” of the prayer of the <hi rend="italic">Eighteen
                                Benedictions</hi>, which expresses the basic belief in the
                            resurrection; cf. <hi rend="italic">BerR</hi> 14.5 (Freedman, <hi
                                rend="italic">Midrash Rabbah, Genesis I</hi>, 113-114) and the
                            extensive apologetic discussion of resurrection beliefs in the
                            Babylonian Talmud in tractate Sanhedrin (<hi rend="italic">bSanh</hi>)

                    </note> As such, it is clear that this opponent takes the words of Paul as
                    authoritative, which means that they are at least in some way affiliated with
                    Christianity. The second piece of evidence that Aphrahat provided concerning the
                    identity of this opponent is the reference to “deceptive teachings, instruments
                    of the evil one (<foreign xml:lang="syr">ܝܘ̈ܠܦܢܐ ܢܟ̈ܝܠܐ ܡܐܢ̈ܘܗܝ ܕܒܝܫܐ</foreign>).”
                    This phrase appears in both Demonstrations 6 and 8 within the context of
                    Aphrahat’s defense of the bodily resurrection, which might suggest that he had a
                    particular opponent in mind when using this phrase. Thus, it is worth pausing to
                    consider whether this opponent can be identified more specifically.</p>
                <p> Elsewhere in the <hi rend="italic">Demonstrations</hi>, Aphrahat used this exact
                    same phrase (<foreign xml:lang="syr">ܝܘ̈ܠܦܢܐ ܢܟ̈ܝܠܐ ܡܐܢ̈ܘܗܝ ܕܒܝܫܐ</foreign>) and then
                    explicitly mentioned three teachers that fall under this category:</p>

                    that the intellect cannot examine him? And who will give reward to the sons of

                            this passage is the apologetic argument that these teachers or
                            communities all practice fasting, but that their fast is ‘not accepted.’
                            Thus, Aphrahat depicted the respective teachings as being connected with
                            ascetic practices that were also part of the life of his own community.
                            Likewise, Aphrahat’s contemporary, Ephrem, who wrote extensively against

                            our works as their fast is like our fast, but their faith is not like

                    are known to have existed in Persia in the fourth and fifth centuries, often in
                    direct competition with communities that would come to be associated with
                    orthodox Christianity. It is entirely possible—because of his repetition of this
                    phrase in the polemical context of his treatment of the resurrection—that
                    Aphrahat is directing this argument about the against one of these ‘heretical’
                    communities. However, because Aphrahat does not name a specific opponent, it is
                    also possible that he was dealing with a misunderstanding among his own
                    community, which may or may not have originated from one of these groups. The
                    broader context of Aphrahat’s exposition of this topic demands a more thorough
                    examination in order to determine whether or not this opponent can be
                    identified.</p>
                <p> Although he is not mentioned by name in Aphrahat’s list of evil teachers, one
                    possible opponent that Aphrahat may have had in mind is the followers of
                    Bardaisan. In a recent article, Thomas D. McGlothlin has made a strong case for
                    identifying various aspects of Bardaisan’s teachings that illuminate Aphrahat’s
                    argument about the resurrection in Demonstration 8.<note place="foot"

                    </note> and then seeks to match this profile with depictions of Bardaisan’s
                    teachings that may have been available in the fourth century, including the <hi
                        rend="italic">Adamantius Dialogue</hi> and the polemical writings of Ephrem
                    the Syrian. The key components of McGlothlin’s profile are that Aphrahat’s
                    opponents seem to recognize the authority of the Old Testament (because Aphrahat
                    appeals to arguments from it) and that they affirm the resurrection of the soul
                    while denying the physical resurrection of the body. Ultimately, McGlothlin
                    argues that these fourth-century constructions of Bardaisan’s
                    teachings—especially that of Ephrem—fit well with the opponent Aphrahat seems to
                    address. McGlothlin’s depiction of Bardaisan’s teachings also fits very well
                    with Ute Possekel’s reconstruction of Bardaisan’s views on the resurrection,
                    namely that Bardaisan likely taught the dissolution of the body, temporary death
                    of the soul, and resurrection of the soul alone.<note place="foot"

                <p> McGlothlin’s assessment of Aphrahat’s opponent and comparison with Bardaisan’s
                    teachings is fruitful and certainly provides a plausible scenario. However,
                    McGlothlin’s only other point of reference in the article is the teachings of
                    Origen of Alexandria, which were certainly circulating in polemical settings in
                    the fourth century. McGlothlin goes on to make the case that the kinds of
                    accusations Origen’s later opponents made against his teachings do not fit as
                    well with the profile of Aphrahat’s opponents. On this matter, I certainly
                    agree: if the choice of identifying Aphrahat’s opponent is between the teachings
                    of Bardaisan and Origen, the former certainly fits better than the latter. But
                    if we explore options beyond Bardaisan and Origen, there are other plausible
                    opponents whom Aphrahat may have engaged.</p>
                <p>In his initial reference to the opponent’s misinterpretation of Paul, Aphrahat
                    addressed a specific issue: the interpretation of the “two Adams” in 1 Cor
                        15:44.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn78" n="78">
                        <p rend="footnote text"> Aphrahat’s citation of this verse reads, “The first

                    </note> Aphrahat’s representation of what he thought was incorrect about this
                    teaching is brief and vague. He merely claimed: “They say that there are two
                    Adams.” His subsequent exegetical exposition of Paul’s verse also posited two
                    Adams: the earthly Adam, created by God in the garden, and the heavenly Adam,
                    “our Lord Jesus Christ.” It is reasonable to conclude, then, that Aphrahat
                    intended to prompt his readers to understand that the “two Adams” posited by his
                    opponents were somehow different from his own interpretation.<note place="foot"

                            point of comparison, that Bardaisan’s use of Adam-Christ typology from 1
                            Cor. 15 would have supported only a resurrection of the soul, not the

                    the midrashic interpretations of Gen 1:27 and 2:7 distinguish between the

                <p>Within the broader context of Augustine’s dispute, it
                        becomes clear that the Manichaean depiction of “two Adams” did not have
                        anything to do with the earthly Adam. Rather, according to Augustine, the
                        Manichaeans asserted that Jesus was the son of the Primal Man. As a result,
                        the “two Adams” of the Manichaeans were not Adam and Christ, but the Primal
                        Man and Christ. This passage from Augustine provides an important comparison
                        with Aphrahat because it shows that we have at least one other witness who
                        explicitly critiques the Manichaean doctrine of the two Adams as a
                        misinterpretation of 1 Cor 15. This piece of evidence certainly does not
                        prove that Aphrahat directed his argument against a Manichaean opponent, but
                        it does show that ideas attributed to Manichaeans in other polemical
                        literature could plausibly represent the viewpoint that Aphrahat
                        critiques.
                </p>
                <p>One further element of Aphrahat’s presentation of the body/soul in the resurrection to be considered is his criterion for distinguishing between those who will be transformed at the resurrection into the perfected, heavenly form and those who will remain in their ‘natural state.’ The relevant criterion was whether or not a given person had maintained the Holy Spirit in purity. Aphrahat’s language here sounds remarkably similar to that of the Rabbis.
                        though of course
                         Rabbinic sources discuss the importance of maintaining the soul, not the Holy Spirit, in purity. Two different Rabbinic texts, for instance, offer brief parable-like stories that illustrate the importance of maintaining the purity of the soul. In the first case, the example is a king who gives royal garments to his servants, some of whom return them in pristine condition, while others return them soiled.

                         The concluding application of the latter parable, implied though not stated in the first, demonstrates the Rabbinic teaching quite well: “
                    Similarly, the Holy One, blessed be He, said, ‘Behold I am pure, my
                    habitation is pure, my attendants are pure, and the soul that I gave you is
                    pure. If you return it to me as I give it to you, well and good; otherwise, I
                    will burn it in your presence.’”<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn88" n="88">

                    </note> This passage shows that within the Rabbinic tradition one can find ideas
                    that are very similar to Aphrahat’s language concerning maintaining the purity
                    of the Holy Spirit and one also finds a clear connection of this need for purity
                    in view of the reward of the afterlife that is to be obtained. Likewise, the
                    text of 4 Ezra 7:78-99 also gives an extended discussion of the separation of
                    and distinction between the souls of the righteous and unrighteous, but there is
                    no indication that the person’s individual soul or spirit plays any role in the
                    judgment.</p>
                <p> There is also a Manichaean text that provides an interesting point of comparison
                    on this issue. One discussion found in the Manichaean <hi rend="italic"
                        >Kephalaia</hi> provides a similar eschatological perspective that deals
                    with the reward and punishment of the time to come. The key passage from this
                    text that is of interest here provides a description of the “second death” for
                    the unrighteous:</p>
                <quote>Now the second death is the death in which the souls of the
                    sinful men shall die; when [they will] be stripped of the shining light that
                    illuminates the world. And also, they are separated from the living air, from
                    which they receive the living breath; and they are deprived of the living soul…
                    because they have blasphemed the Holy Spirit since every generation of the
                        world.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn89" n="89">

                <p>This text explains that some will be punished in the life to come because they
                    have blasphemed the Holy Spirit. Aphrahat explicitly warned his hearers not to
                    ‘grieve’ the Holy Spirit in the context of his discussion of the resurrection;
                    indeed, according to Aphrahat, the act of grieving the Holy Spirit is precisely
                    what causes the Spirit to testify against people in the final judgment. We may
                    also observe another similarity between this passage and Aphrahat’s treatment of
                    the resurrection: warnings about the second death. In Dem. 8, Aphrahat declared,
                    “It is right for us, however, to fear the second death, which is full of weeping
                    and gnashing of teeth, groans, and miseries, and which is situated in the outer
                        darkness.”<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn90" n="90">

                <p> The similarities between this Manichaean material and Aphrahat’s depiction of
                    the judgment and resurrection are intriguing, but intriguing similarities are
                    insufficient evidence to argue that Aphrahat was engaging Manichaeans directly.
                    Moreover, as we have seen, Manichaeans were not the only community with such
                    intriguing similarities with Aphrahat’s opponent. Thus, we must exercise caution
                    in making definitive claims about the identity these opponents. </p>
                <p>Even if specific arguments that Aphrahat makes about his opponents can be
                    plausibly mapped onto historical reconstructions of particular teachers, we know
                    very little about the ways that these teachings were transmitted in the early
                    Syriac tradition. Likewise, we have very little data for how the communities
                    that received these teachings would have attached specific ideas to particular
                    teachers or how they would have identified themselves. It is s entirely
                    plausible that ideas and concepts we as historians might identify as
                    “Bardaisanite” or “Manichaean” or “Jewish” may have circulated freely among
                    people for whom those labels would be artificial and inaccurate. The ideas that,
                    over time, have come to be regarded as distinctly associated with a particular
                    thinker or their followers may not have been rigid boundary markers between
                    distinct religious identities in antiquity, particularly in the early period of
                    development for Christian communities. The emergence of polemical literature,
                    such as the anti-heretical writings of Ephrem in the late fourth century,
                    attests to the construction of communal identity markers, and the attempt to
                    associate particular heretical ideas with specific teachers plays a significant
                    role in the formation of boundaries. In this regard, the polemical arguments
                    that Aphrahat engages regarding the resurrection are not concerned with the
                    construction of heretical and orthodox beliefs per se; that is, Aphrahat shows
                    no desire to construct and thereby oppose a specific opponent. However,
                    Aphrahat’s argument does attempt to construct a logical, cohesive Christian
                    theology of the soul/body problem, including the implications of that problem
                    for the doctrine of the resurrection.</p>

                <head>Conclusion: Aphrahat’s Anthropology in Context</head>
                <p>While many of the texts discussed above shed some light on the various components
                    of Aphrahat’s depiction of the soul/body relationship, no single text or piece
                    of information concerning a contemporary religious group suffices to enable the
                    modern interpreter to explain his unique views. Rabbinic materials, and
                    particularly the midrashic interpretations of Genesis, illuminate some concepts,
                    but not others. Likewise, while it is clear that Aphrahat directed part of his
                    polemic against some contemporary group engaged in the interpretation of
                    Christian Scripture, the attempt to identify this opponent proves to be quite
                    difficult.</p>
                <p> If we resist the temptation to locate a <hi rend="italic">specific</hi> opponent
                    and instead focus on the broader milieu of religious and philosophical ideas
                    about the body, the soul, and about what happens at death and the resurrection,
                    it is possible to view Aphrahat’s arguments as part of a larger conversation.
                    Aphrahat engaged this conversation with some exegetical and hermeneutical
                    traditions that were evident in preceding and contemporary religious
                    communities, but he also provided a unique expression of those traditions based
                    on the needs of his own community and his interpretation of Scripture. Thus,
                    even if the context of Aphrahat’s arguments do not provide enough information to
                    correctly identify his opponent(s), the contours of the polemic do tell us
                    something about Aphrahat’s own community.</p>
                <p> That Aphrahat felt the need to support his views with specific arguments against
                    alternative exegetical conclusions suggests that his positions were not
                    necessarily representative of everyone’s views in his immediate community. One
                    might be tempted to read his works as a straightforward depiction of his local
                    expression of Christianity, and thus one might equate Aphrahat’s beliefs with
                    those of his community. However, if we search beneath the surface of Aphrahat’s
                    certainty about the issues he addressed, we find evidence of a Christian
                    community whose particular dogmatic identity was not completely secure or
                    defined. Indeed, perhaps Aphrahat should not be taken as the sole representative
                    of a particular expression of Christianity that we might call a native ‘Syriac’
                    or ‘Persian’ Christianity. Rather his writings could serve as a witness to the
                    diversity of Christian communities in the Persian milieu within which his works
                    originated. Instead of thinking of separate, distinct religious communities with
                    already defined beliefs and practices, it might be more productive to think of
                    multiple Christian communities, lacking precise identity markers that would
                    distinguish them from one another. In this regard, Aphrahat’s writings might
                    best be viewed as an attempt to articulate and shape the identity of a
                    particular expression of Christianity by providing precisely such identity
                    markers and dogmatic borders.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn91" n="91">
                        <p rend="footnote text"> What I am arguing here for Aphrahat is quite
                            similar to, and influenced by, Christine Shepardson’s treatment of
                            Ephrem in her work <hi rend="italic">Anti-Judaism and Christian
                                Orthodoxy: Ephrem’s Hymns in Fourth-Century Syria</hi> (Washington

                </p>
                <p> Aphrahat’s arguments about the body/soul relationship offer a good example of
                    how his writings might be viewed through this lens. His initial discussion of
                    the topic of the body/soul and what happens at the resurrection is not an
                    isolated, independent argument; it appears within the context of the
                    Demonstration dedicated to the <hi rend="italic">Bnay Qyama</hi>, a special
                    group within Aphrahat’s community of fellow believers who dedicated themselves
                    to chastity. Aphrahat’s discussion of how human beings receive the breath/spirit
                    of God at creation and of how Christians receive the Holy Spirit at baptism is
                    preceded by a survey of holy women and men, examples in the chaste life, who
                    were able to lead such a life because of the power of the Holy Spirit. Moreover,
                    Aphrahat’s argument also carried a moral component when he went on to warn his
                    audience that the Spirit could depart from them at any time, and that the Spirit
                    would certainly depart from them in the case of sin. To complete this
                    exposition, he informed his audience how they might retain the Spirit and not
                    grieve her.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn92" n="92">

                    members of his community: “Receive what I have explained to you, and believe
                    that on the day of resurrection your body will rise up in its entirety. You will
                    receive the reward for your faith from your Lord, and will rejoice and take

                </p>
                <p> There are multiple beliefs, practices, or traditions originating from various
                    religious traditions that could have influenced Aphrahat’s ideas: the
                    bifurcation of a religious community into a small group of ascetic elites and a
                    larger group whose members were not bound by the same strict ascetic demands was
                    at the very core of Manichaean belief and practice; the concept of maintaining
                    the Holy Spirit/Spirit of God in purity as the basis for eternal salvation
                    appeared both in Rabbinic and in Manichaean thought; the idea of the sleep of
                    the soul is attested by some early Christian witnesses, but does not seem to
                    have gained much popularity; the wide ranging interpretive traditions of Gen 2:7
                    demonstrate the creativity with which various Jewish and Christian authors
                    opined on the creation of the soul; and various interpretations of 1 Cor 15 and
                    the subsequent implications for beliefs about the resurrection appear in the
                    surviving literature of a number of Christian communities, covering virtually
                    the entire range of expressions of earliest Christianity. However, none of these
                    prior traditions “explains” or “contextualizes” Aphrahat’s views in isolation
                    from the others. Yet if we consider the composite picture of these traditions,
                    it is possible to view Aphrahat’s writings as the attempt to provide some sense
                    of stability, a concrete expression of belief and practice emerging out of the
                    inchoate, unorganized state of Christian identity in fourth-century Persia. The
                    writings attributed to Aphrahat are thus not a representative of “Christianity”
                    over and against other religious communities; rather, they are a witness to a
                    stage in the development of Christian identity in Persia when the precise
                    contours of Christian practice and belief were not well defined.</p>

                <p>As a postscript, it is worth reflecting on whether or not Aphrahat’s attempt to
                    define a particular Christian identity was successful. Although we do not have
                    much direct data for the immediate reception of the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Demonstrations</hi>, it is noteworthy that the first known Syriac author
                    who explicitly engages content from the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Demonstrations</hi>, George, bishop of the Arabs, was not impressed with
                    the writings of the anonymous Persian Sage.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn94"
                        n="94">
                        <p rend="footnote text"> George does not know the identity of the author of
                            the <hi rend="italic">Demonstrations</hi>, whom he refers to only as the
                            Persian Sage; George, Bishop of the Arabs, “Letter 4.” As a text and
                            translation, I have used Jack Tannous’ unpublished edition of George’s
                            letters.</p>
                    </note> Writing to his pupil, Yeshuʿ, George argues that the Persian Sage should
                    not be counted among the “approved teachers” (<foreign xml:lang="syr">ܡܠܦ̈ܢܐ ܚܬܝ̈ܬܐ</foreign> ) because he does
                    not have “approved teachings” (<foreign xml:lang="syr">ܡܠܦܢܘ̈ܬܐ ܚܬܝ̈ܬܐ</foreign> ). George asserts
                    further that the <hi rend="italic">Demonstrations</hi> contain many
                    “errors” (<foreign xml:lang="syr">ܦܘܕ̈ܐ</foreign>) and
                    dissuades Yeshuʿ from reading them further.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn95"

                    </note> Somewhat ironically, it is precisely Aphrahat’s discussion of the
                    indwelling of the Holy Spirit, touched upon in the argument above, that George
                    finds most objectionable. This brief episode from the reception history of the
                        <hi rend="italic">Demonstrations</hi> provides further evidence
                    that the writings of Aphrahat witness to a developmental phase in
                    Syriac-speaking Christianity, and Aphrahat’s expression of Christian identity
                    was by no means authoritative.</p>

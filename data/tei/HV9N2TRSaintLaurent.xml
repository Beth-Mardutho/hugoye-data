         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P1"/>[1] The
    early Christians traveled from distant lands to touch sacred
    places and to gaze upon the faces of holy men and women who
    shined forth as vessels of divine love.<ref target="#FN1">1</ref> In the
    tradition of visiting living saints and seeing the landscape
    against which they are situated, scholars and students made a
    similar journey to the <hi rend="italic">loca sancta</hi> of the modern
    Syriac-speaking churches in August 2005. Through the
    expert organizational skills and enterprising spirit of Dr.
    George Kiraz, and on account of the support of many
    self-sacrificing people along the way,<ref target="#FN2">2</ref> we visited the
    Christian sites of Istanbul, Tur Abdin, and Harput, August
    3-18, 2005. The trip was organized by Dorushe, the
    graduate student organization affiliated with Beth Mardutho:
    The Syriac Institute. Each day uncovered new pearls for us, as
    we encountered the distant voices of the Syriac past as well as
    the living faces that comprise the modern churches of the
    Syrian Christians in Turkey.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P2"/>[2] Our
    group itself was a felicitous blend of students, scholars, and
    enthusiasts of Syriac. George Kiraz of Beth Mardutho came with
    his wife Christine, who co-directs Gorgias Press, and they
    brought their two children Tabitha (4) and Sebastian Kenoro
    (2). Having these youngsters, who are fluent in
    <hi rend="italic">Kthobonoyo</hi> Syriac, brought joy to the group and
    impressed the local clergy and people of Tur Abdin. George's
    sister, Alaria Saar, and her friend Hoang-Anh Do, came from
    California, and with their pharmaceutical knowledge they helped
    to keep our bodies calm from the spice of Turkish
    food. Rev. Dr. Paul S. Russell, a Syriac scholar, joined
    us from St. Joseph of Arimathea Anglican Theological College in
    Berkeley, CA.  Prof. Alison Salvesen from Oxford
    University accompanied us as our group Syriac scholar. 
    Hidemi Takahashi, a Bar Hebraeus scholar of boundless curiosity
    and encyclopedic knowledge of Syriac Christianity, joined us
    from Chuo University, Tokyo (he has since transferred to the
    University of Tokyo). Our graduate student constituency
    included Carl Griffin from Brigham Young University, Jonathan
    Loopstra from the Catholic University of America, Miriam
    Goldstein from Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Mark DelCogliano
    from Emory University, Rev. Gareth Hughes from Cardiff
    University in Wales, and myself from Brown University. In
    all, we hailed from four countries, six universities. Thus
    fifteen distinct personalities came together to create a wealth
    of knowledge and energy for the group.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P3"/>[3] We spent
    the first few days in Istanbul as we joined together from
    various countries. We visited the magnificent Hagia
    Sophia/Ayasofya, once the great church of Byzantine
    Christendom. We also saw the Chora Church and enjoyed the
    beauty that adorns Turkey's historical center. The true
    highlights, however, were meeting the groups of Christians in
    Istanbul: both the Greek Orthodox and the Syriac
    Orthodox. The Armenian Apostolic Church and the Roman
    Catholic Church also have important communities in Istanbul,
    and all the Christian groups together have solid and sisterly
    relationships. We attended the evening prayer of the
    Syriac Orthodox community in a church outside of
    Istanbul. The people greeted us with warm hospitality, and
    His Eminence Filuksinos Yusuf Çetin, Syriac Orthodox
    Metropolitan for Istanbul and Ankara, invited us to a
    reception. He shared with us the current situation of
    their church in Istanbul, and he related his efforts to
    strengthen the community of the Suryoye in the city through
    reaching out especially to the young people of his
    flock. He spoke of the struggles of being a minority
    religion in Turkey, and he emphasized the importance of keeping
    a close relationship with the monastic communities and dioceses
    of Tur Abdin and Harput. The bishop gave us generous
    souvenirs from our visit. The nuns living there at his
    residence prepared a delicious meal for us, and we met some of
    the pillars of the Istanbul Suryoyo community.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P4"/>[4] On
    Sunday, August 7, we traveled to the Phanar district of
    Istanbul to attend the liturgy celebrated by His All Holiness
    the Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew. There, we celebrated with
    the Orthodox Church the morning prayers and divine liturgy, in
    the presence of the relics of John Chrysostom and Gregory of
    Nazianzus. Our group had the honor of being received by the
    Patriarch, who bestowed gifts on us. He shared his vision for
    the Church, his efforts to attend to his local and global
    flock, and his personal dedication to causes like the
    protection of the environment. A man of grace and
    humility, he blessed the baby Sebastian Kenoro Kiraz. He
    told us how much his Church needs the prayers and love of the
    global Christian community.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P5"/>[5] Monday,
    August 8, we flew to Diyarbakir in Southeastern Turkey, where
    our bus drivers Elias (from Midin) and Faulos (from Beth
    Qustan) greeted us. It was a delight to hear the beauty of
    their spoken Syriac, and in the vans we were graced to listen
    to the modern music of the Suryoyo community! We drove
    into Diyarbakir, ancient Amida, and we visited the Syriac
    Orthodox church of the Yoldath Aloho (Meryemana). The
    church, the seat of the patriarchate for brief periods in the
    1860’s, is set off by walls, and as one enters one sees a
    small garden that the small community tends. The women
    were working outside in the shade on their quilting and drying
    fruits and vegetables. The walls of the church contained
    many beautiful inlaid Syriac inscriptions. The church itself
    contained the relics of Dionysius Bar Salibi and the tomb of
    Jacob of Sarugh. The priest who received us in the church, Fr.
    Yusuf Akbulut, had the experience, in 2000-2001, of spending
    some months in cells—which were not of the monastic
    kind—for talking in public on the genocide of the
    Christians in the early 20<hi rend="sup">th</hi> century. We also
    visited the church of Mar Petyon, which is Chaldean
    Catholic. There was once an Armenian church in Diyarbakir
    (now occupied by a Kurdish family), but we were unable to get
    inside. What was the main church of the city is now a mosque,
    reminiscent in its style, though smaller, of another edifice
    with a similar history, the Umayyad Mosque in
    Damascus. After leaving the city with its formidable
    basalt wall, we stopped along the Tigris River at an old stone
    bridge, built in 1065. We coasted alongside the River for
    another hour before reaching Mardin, our home for the next four
    nights.</p>

            <anchor corresp="P6"/>[6] Our
    second day in the area around Tur Abdin took us to the once
    mighty fortress-town of Dara. There is an interesting
    depiction there of a risen Christ on the outside of a cave. We
    visited the necropolis and underground cistern, and the local
    children there gave us flowers. We climbed below to a
    church now underground that had been a temple to the sun gods
    worshipped by ancient Mesopotamians. Outside we saw a structure
    with “channels” that had once been covered by
    arches. It seems to have been a storage area for grain
    — logical, as pointed out by Dr. Salvesen, given the
    constant back and forth of armies in the region that would have
    used such grain stores.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P7"/>[7] We drove
    further to Nisibis, modern Nusaybin, to visit the city that was
    once a stronghold for Syriac literature and learning, the place
    St. Ephrem and St. Jacob called home. We visited the
    impressive church of Mor Ya<hi rend="sup">
               <hi rend="italic">c</hi>
            </hi>qub with its
    double altars. On his journeys as bishop, Mor
    Ya<hi rend="sup">
               <hi rend="italic">c</hi>
            </hi>qub had seen the bigger churches of
    cities like Nicaea, and he decided that Nisibis deserved one,
    too. We climbed down to the crypt of the city's great
    fourth-century church that lies underneath the altar to touch
    the tomb of Mor Ya<hi rend="sup">
               <hi rend="italic">c</hi>
            </hi>qub. We walked
    around the outside of the church that has been partially
    excavated, and was completely underground until three years
    ago. We read inscriptions on its hallowed walls. While in the
    church with the tomb of Mor Ya<hi rend="sup">
               <hi rend="italic">c</hi>
            </hi>qub beneath
    our feet, Dr. Salvesen lectured for the group on Syrian
    Christianity in the Nisibene area. Dr. Salvesen related the
    history of the area around Nisibis, drawing on the information
    from the Syriac Chronicles. The School at Nisibis has not yet
    been excavated.</p>

         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P8"/>[8] We spoke
    with other pilgrims in Nisibis who had come from Germany.
    Political danger had driven them from their village of Mor Bobo
    nearby, and the father had taken his daughters back to the Tur
    Abdin area so that they could reconnect with their roots. We
    also met as a large group of Christians from the city of
    Qamishli in Syria, just across the border from Nisibis. From
    Nisibis we drove up the valley along the ancient Mygdonius and
    had lunch by the headwaters of the White Waters (<hi rend="italic">Maye
    Hewore</hi>) where we cooled down with kebobs. This
    restaurant/picnic area suspended on rafts over the water was a
    refreshing break from the scorching weather, and we visited
    with a number of Kurdish Muslim families who had come back for
    summer visits to the area. We could speak to the children in
    German or French, and they translated for the parents, who,
    despite the relatively long period they had been in Europe,
    were limited in languages other than Kurdish. Kurdish musicians
    serenaded us on the <hi rend="italic">kemanje</hi> and other regional
    instruments.</p>

            <anchor corresp="P9"/>[9] We drove
    on into the heart of Tur Abdin, on the way passing over the
    watershed between the Tigris and the Euphrates. We arrived at
    the Monastery of Mor Gabriel, where the Metropolitan Bishop of
    Tur Abdin, Mor Timotheos Samuel Aktaş, greeted us and
    offered us tea and watermelon. We met Malfono Isa there, who
    busily works as a teacher at Mor Gabriel, teaching local boys
    such as Faulos (who spoke both <hi rend="italic">Kthobonoyo</hi> and modern
    Syriac, as well as Kurdish, Turkish, Arabic and some English!),
    as well as Suryoyo youth who arrive from Europe to study for a
    period of time before beginning university back home. Isa gave
    us a tour of the monastery and the churches, much of it
    recently refurbished. It was stunning in its monumental beauty.
    The main church at Mor Gabriel has a beautiful mosaic floor and
    altar. Behind the altar we climbed up into the cave where
    ascetics would watch and pray in solitude. He took us to
    the <hi rend="italic">Beth Qadishe</hi> (burial area), and we touched sacred
    relics. We saw the eating areas and the beautiful fields below
    where the monastic community grows crops. The women in our
    group also went to the convent to meet the nuns. Our
    reception at Mor Gabriel was warm and unforgettable. We went to
    <hi rend="italic">Ramsho</hi> prayer service with the people, in a plain but
    beautiful chapel, and then we continued on to supper with them:
    simple fare, including yogurt-barley soup. We sat upstairs
    for tea afterwards and spoke with visitors — the
    monastery is a popular destination amongst Christians from
    Syria. Among them were visitors from Melkiyya (the hometown of
    Mor Severios Malki Murad, current Syriac Orthodox bishop of
    Jerusalem) and Qamishli.</p>

            <anchor corresp="P10"/>[10] On
    August 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, we began the fast before the feast of
    the Assumption, or ‘Transfer’ (<hi rend="italic">shunoyo</hi>),
    as it is called in Syriac.  We traveled northeast from
    Mardin, on the Mardin-Midyat road to Qelleth (Syr.) /Qillith
    (Arab.). Although the historic route from Mardin to Midyat
    passed through Qelleth, today the village is not off the modern
    main road. Thus, it took quite a long time to find this
    village, yet we realized as soon as we arrive that it was worth
    the effort. Once a populated Christian town, all the Christians
    have since left. However, we met a man there who has returned
    to restore the Syriac Orthodox church there, Mor
    Yuhanon. He had left the village for Sweden sixteen years
    before. The Swedish Syriac Orthodox community is funding this
    project. Today only two families remain in the village. Qelleth
    is rather isolated and must receive supplies intermittently
    from other towns. There is a small graveyard there, where
    one sees the grave of the <hi rend="italic">mukhtar</hi> who was killed by
    the Kurds in 1992.  Above the altar in the church reads
    <hi rend="italic">Ilono d’haye</hi> — tree of life. Sebastian and
    Tabitha ran all around the church, as the scholars sorted
    through a pile of manuscripts and papers in the back of the
    church. Others explored the remains of houses, doing their best
    to avoid the bats! There are ruins of three monasteries in the
    area, Mor Abai, Mor Dimet, and the “Monastery of the
    Headache”, the last visited by those seeking cure from
    migraine. Additionally, the town has abandoned Syrian Catholic
    and Protestant churches. Some work had been done to restore the
    Protestant church.</p>

            <anchor corresp="P11"/>[11] We
    also visited the town of Bnebil, where we met a charming
    eighty-five year old priest, who recounted stories of the
    struggles, resilience, and valiance of the Christians in recent
    history. The priest Ya<hi rend="sup">

            </hi>un Kfarzoyo (Yakub Günay in
    Turkish) lives there with his wife. Although they are both
    in their eighties, they are flourishing with stalwart
    spirits. Fr. Ya<hi rend="sup">
               <hi rend="italic">c</hi>
            </hi>qub was ordained a
    priest in 1954. Some of us remained outside and spoke with the
    priest’s wife, a small woman with thick glasses, who
    spoke of the difficulties of life in the town. Eight Christian
    families and two Muslim families remain. The church contained
    among its many treasures that the <hi rend="italic">qashisho</hi> showed us,
    a manuscript from the pen of the scholar-bishop Filuksinos

    fifty people had left Bnebil after fights with the Muslims in
    the 1960’s, and many had fled to Syria or
    Istanbul. In 1915, the Kurds had come and killed four of
    the city’s leaders. The church has received aid from
    Sweden to help restoration efforts. As we left Bnebil, we
    could see the Monastery of Mor Stephanos in the cliff above the
    village.</p>

               <hi rend="italic">c</hi>
            </hi>faran, the saffron monastery perched
    on a hill overlooking the plain to the south of Mardin. As we
    arrived, it was nearing sundown. We quickly prepared to ascend
    the hill atop the monastery, where four other monasteries for
    solitaries lie. A young man who was living at the monastery,
    Ephrem, led us up through the bushy terrain, and after a half
    hour of steady climbing, steep and difficult in some places, we
    reached the monastery of Our Lady of the Drop [Yoldath Aloho
    d-Nutfo/Dayro d-Nutfo]. It is perched on the top of the
    mountain, carved into the face of the rock, with stunningly
    beautiful views over the plain below and Dayr
    al-Za<hi rend="sup">
               <hi rend="italic">c</hi>
            </hi>faran. Only silence dwells there now,
    and the spirits of the monastics who had prayed there for
    centuries filled the summer evening with comfort and assurance.
    We gathered as a group in the chapel and gave thanks —
    “it was good to be there.” On the climb downwards,
    although it was nearly dark, we followed the way of a shepherd
    and his sheep, and we reached the monastery by evening.</p>

    special guests were awaiting us inside Dayr
    al-Za<hi rend="sup">
               <hi rend="italic">c</hi>
            </hi>faran. The great living light of
    Syriac learning, Malfono Abrohom Nouro, happened to be there
    visiting from Aleppo, and his presence and refulgent spirit was
    a grace. He spoke to our group about his life’s work and
    passion: the promotion, pedagogy and scholarship of the Syriac
    language. His energy was boundless, and we were able to buy
    signed copies of his books on learning Syriac, including
    <hi rend="italic">Souloko</hi>. We also met Hatune Doğan, a Syriac
    scholar and teacher originally from the village of Zaz in Tur
    Abdin, but who now lives in Germany. She has been working
    with young women coming to Dayr al-Za<hi rend="sup">
               <hi rend="italic">c</hi>
            </hi>faran
    from abroad to learn Syriac. She spoke of her efforts to
    promote girls’ education in the monastery. Metropolitan
    Filuksinos Saliba Özmen of Mardin, who lives in Dayr
    al-Za<hi rend="sup">
               <hi rend="italic">c</hi>
            </hi>faran, greeted us warmly and sat and
    talked with us for a long while. There was a lively exchange
    between the bishop and the scholars from Britain, who updated
    him on the state of Syriac Studies at Oxford, where the Bishop
    had studied. His Eminence gave us much love and thoughtful
    presents, and Dr. Salvesen gave him his favorite English tea.
    We also received a tour of the monastery, seeing the places
    where the patriarchs and bishops of the past were buried in the
    walls. We visited the living quarters of the bishop. Many
    pilgrims were simultaneously visiting as we were there. We
    shared a lovely meal with the people there, and later we drove
    back to Mardin, high above the plain.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P14"/>[14] The
    next morning, we woke up early to set out on the three hour
    drive to Urfa, or ancient Edessa/Urhoy. The drive between
    Mardin and Edessa is long and dry, and we planned to do it in
    one day. We passed by Viranşehir — ancient
    Tella. As we reached Edessa, we were struck by a town buzzing
    around with people and traffic. We stopped for a drink of ayran
    and some bread and pastries in a park before beginning our
    excursion. We walked to the top of the towering citadel
    protecting the city, and we investigated its two columns with
    their famed Syriac inscription. The two large columns are also
    called “Nimrod’s throne,” and according to
    legend Abraham was launched from them when he was a baby. He
    was caught by a pool, where holy carp now swim. After climbing
    around the citadel, we walked down to see the carp.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P15"/>[15] The
    museum of the city contains outside the lovely mosaics from
    ancient Edessa known to us from Segal,<ref target="#FN3">3</ref> but they are
    outside, unkempt, and dusty. The outside yard of the museum
    contains Christian funerary inscriptions and tombs, as well as
    pillars, Roman statues, Hittite engravings of archers, and
    inscriptions from Tella and other important historical sites.
    It was painful to see these treasures, in Syriac, Greek and
    Ottoman Turkish, unlabeled and “maintained” outside
    in questionable conditions. The inside of the museum contains
    the sad remnants of the twentieth-century atrocities against
    the Christians in Edessa: statuettes of saints from modern
    churches now stripped sit in the museum and gather dust. Some
    of us wandered around the streets of Urfa — two main
    streets that designate the earlier flow of the Daysan before
    its rerouting by Justinian, which flank the raised level of the
    town itself. We visited many churches that have been
    transformed into mosques, such as the former St. John’s
    church, where the two building structures were clearly once a
    church and baptistery. We were led to the former Armenian
    church, now a mosque, by three locals, 20-something-year-old
    Turks who were happy to tolerate our primitive Turkish! We also
    wandered around in the bazaar, which was built by Suleiman the
    Magnificent.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P16"/>[16] We
    were unsuccessful in locating the rock tombs described by Segal
    as being in the hills to the west of the citadel, being
    directed first to the modern town cemetery, a result of the
    unsuccessful combination of Said’s (our bus driver)
    Turkish and Miriam’s Arabic. Edessa’s vestiges
    of its shiny Christian past are difficult to discern now, as
    mosques stand where once Ephrem’s church would have been.
    Egeria who visited Edessa in the fourth century would probably
    not recognize the town there, yet we perceived with our hearts
    through the spirit of the city the beauty that earned Edessa
    the epithet of “blessed.” We stopped through Harran
    on our way back, braving nearly five kilometers of unpaved
    road, apparently part of the Turkish efforts at renewing the
    region along with the new dam. The town walls have been
    partially restored, as well as one of the gates, and we drove
    inside the village to see the famous beehive houses. The
    aggressive behavior of the locals encouraged us to leave Harran
    quickly, following Abraham’s example!</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P17"/>[17] On
    August 12, we continued our tour of the villages of Tur
    Abdin.  We drove to Azekh, also known as Idil, a town to
    which the Kirazes could trace their maternal roots. In
    Azekh/Beth Zabday we met a small group of Suryoye jewelers who
    had set up their shop for business, having returned to Azekh
    after living for a time in Germany. We bought some presents for
    our loved ones back at home. The Suryoye shared with us
    how they had single-handedly raised up their church from the
    rubble, and they were working tirelessly to reestablish a
    strong foothold of their Christian community in Azekh. They
    took us inside the church. They narrated to us how the people
    of Azekh “held on” in 1915 for forty days while
    their village was attacked.  Likewise, in 1923 the
    Christian women of Azekh had fiercely warded off the Turks with
    stones, and they attributed their success to help from the
    Virgin Mary, for whom the church of Yoldath Aloho is named. Our
    guides also told us about the German military adviser (WWI) who
    was with the besieging army, who decided to become a monk
    following this miraculous victory. He reportedly later became a
    cardinal!</p>

         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P18"/>[18] When
    the people here speak of their roots, their tone of voice
    reveals the pride they had in the strength of their
    forefathers. We were joined in our visit to the church by
    Suryoye visiting from abroad, such as Gabriel, who left 25
    years ago. He now lives in Holland and has children whom
    he has named Nineveh, Babel and Salin (former name of
    Qamishli). Many of these visitors stay in town during the day,
    but sleep in the guest rooms at Mor Gabriel. They spoke of the
    importance of preserving their culture and heritage.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P19"/>[19] We
    traveled onwards to Midin, a town that remains wholly
    Christian. Our bus driver Elias hails from Midin, and he
    showed us where he had grown up and played football as a
    boy. Suzy was our guide in Midin. She had returned to
    Midin five years previously, after living for twenty years in
    Germany. She was energetic and young-looking — “I
    don’t feel 40!” Her husband had died prior to
    her return to Midin, and she told us it was not easy for her to
    make ends meet. She shared that the locals receive few
    “tourists” in Midin. We visited also the
    church of Mor Sobo in the courtyard of a local house in Midin,
    and it lies half underground. The main Church in Midin is
    named after Mor Ya<hi rend="sup">
               <hi rend="italic">c</hi>
            </hi>qub of Sarugh, which was
    originally built in 450 AD. It was destroyed during Timur
    Lane’s invasion of the area and rebuilt in 1525. We were
    told that there were three other churches in use — Mor
    Barsaumo, Mor Zokhe, Mor Yuhanon
    Ma<hi rend="sup">
               <hi rend="italic">c</hi>
            </hi>mdono/John the Baptist. In all, twenty
    churches adorn the town! Around fifty-five families live in
    Midin today, and they keep themselves isolated from the
    non-Christian population around them.</p>

    then visited Beth Sbirino, where a charming boy who spoke
    excellent German showed us the main church of Mor
    Dodo. There, we read manuscripts in Karshuni with the
    local malfono — he enjoyed it as much as we did! There
    were once twenty-five churches in Beth Sbirino.</p>

    August 13th, we traveled to Salah, where there is only a very
    small, but valiant Christian community now. We visited the
    Monastery of Mor Ya<hi rend="sup">
               <hi rend="italic">c</hi>
            </hi>qub, once the seat of
    the “patriarchs of Tur Abdin.” Here, a number of
    monks and nuns have come to live, after restoring the church
    and setting it up for visitors splendidly. Aziz Bolan, the only
    Christian left in the town, received us. We spent a good part
    of the morning examining the numerous inscriptions around the
    entrance to the church, and then Aziz gave us a tour of the
    whole complex, including excavations undertaken near the back.
    Aziz was quite happy to take us into town to see houses and
    churches once belonging to Christians. We followed Aziz through
    the village, trying to avoid the open running sewage in the
    streets and the barn animals roaming freely, and he took us to
    the church of Mor Aphrem which is used now as a cowshed.</p>

    Hah, we went to the radiant church of Yoldath Aloho. There are
    about twenty Christian families there today. According to
    legend, this church is the oldest church in Christendom, built
    by the kings from the East on their way home from Bethlehem.
    (According to more “scientific” accounts, it was
    originally built in the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> or 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi>
    century.) It is a restored jewel against a beautiful desert
    landscape, unique in its octagonal shape, and intricately
    decorated inside. The eve of the great feast of the Assumption
    was in the air, and pilgrims whom we had met along the way were
    preparing for the overnight stay in Hah. We ate lunch there
    along with Faulos, and we very much enjoyed the cooking of the
    friendly woman running the kitchen. In Hah, we also went to the
    ruins of Mor Sobo and wandered around in its buildings and
    graveyard.</p>

    Next, we stopped at Bakusyone, or Beth Qustan (Constantine),
    the home of both the eponymous abbot and present bishop of the
    Monastery of Mor Gabriel. The church there is named Mor Eliyo.
    This was also the hometown of our bus driver Faulos, and we got
    to meet his little baby boy while passing through. It has been
    greatly restored, as well.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P24"/>[24] We
    drove onwards to the lovely Dayro da-Slibo, where five
    Christian families have returned from Europe to live in the old
    monastic complex. The main church is dedicated to the Holy
    Cross. The smaller building to the right was the church (grave)
    of Mor Aho. The nun who lives there now, Maryam, is a sprightly
    and intelligent woman, who spoke to us in Arabic as she climbed
    up and down the ecclesiastical complex, which has been lovingly
    restored by the Swedish Suryoye community. The monastery is
    built “higgledy-piggledy” with staircases all
    around. Sister Maryam’s brother Gabriel was also there.
    We also met Khālisa, who was drying salted tomatoes on the
    roof of the church! We sat and drank tea and cold water
    (getting brave — not from bottles!) with Maryam. Despite
    her sprightliness, it was clear that she had huge
    responsibilities in taking care of the large complex.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P25"/>[25] Then
    we drove back to Midyat, and we stopped outside the town to see
    the Monastery of Mor Abrohom and Hobil, founded in the fifth
    century. We then entered Midyat and visited Mor Shimuni. Inside
    the church, Faulos opened up a grand copy of the Syriac Gospels
    with colored pictures, and he read with us. We read
    inscriptions on the baptistery and all over the church, and
    those of us with less experience with inscriptions were helped
    by our comrades as well as our driver! It is worth
    mentioning that Faulos was far beyond a mere driver, serving as
    translator between the numerous languages mentioned above, as
    well as correcting our Syriac reading!</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P26"/>[26] We
    visited the church Mor Barsaumo in Midyat, where the faithful
    were emerging, each with two loaves of bread, in observance of
    a funeral of a priest who had been killed in a car accident the
    day before. There, Malfono Ayhan showed us his classroom, and
    we saw the bread baking for the next day’s mass on a coal
    stove. We were hungry, and it smelled great! The drive back
    from Midyat in the evening was beautiful, and we watched the
    sunset and as we passed through small villages.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P27"/>[27] On
    Sunday in Mardin, we visited the church of the Forty Martyrs,
    where we attended the Divine Liturgy. We were received by the
    bishop of Mardin/Dayr al-Za<hi rend="sup">
               <hi rend="italic">c</hi>
            </hi>faran, Bishop
    Saliba. We sat in his beautiful salon with many of the faithful
    and drank bitter coffee (due to the funeral the day before).
    Mardin was the seat of the bishop, who is now in residence at
    Dayr al-Za<hi rend="sup">

            </hi>faran.  It was the center

    The church there, named for the Forty Martyrs of Sebaste, is
    370 years old. The interior is beautifully decorated with icons
    of saints, including a stunning one of the Martyrs of Sebaste
    meeting their chilly death. The church was quite full for the
    Sunday liturgy.</p>

    of our hotel in Elazığ. The first was from
    George Kiraz, who directed us in improving our spoken Syriac,
    using John Healey’s book <hi rend="italic">Leshono Suryoyo: First
    Studies in Syriac</hi> (Piscataway, NJ: Gorgias Press,
    2005). Hidemi Takahashi reviewed with us his scholarship
    on Bar Hebraeus, referring us to his book <hi rend="italic">Bar Hebraeus: A
    Bio-Bibliography</hi> (Piscataway, NJ: Gorgias Press, 2005). We
    then heard from Alison Salvesen, who spoke about how Syriac
    writers of the fourth century, like Ephrem, describe or
    identify themselves in relation to the area in which they grew
    up. She mentioned, for example, that Ephrem’s fourth hymn
    on Julian Sabas referred to <hi rend="italic">our land</hi> as the land of
    Abraham, Jacob and the patriarchs. She also spoke about Jacob
    of Edessa’s pride that Syriac was a language close to
    Hebrew, although he himself was “pro-Greek.” For
    the East-Syrians, in contrast, Hebrew had less prestige, but
    the biblical references to Aram were very important. She
    spoke about the evolution of the term “Syrian,” and
    the linguistic and geographical definitions that developed
    throughout the first millennium CE.   </p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P31"/>[31] For
    the feast of the Virgin Mary, we drove up to the city of
    Harput, and the church of Yoldath Aloho. Harput has long been a
    center of Syriac and Armenian Christianity. The church in
    Harput dates from the second century, and has long been a place
    of pilgrimage to Mary. Although the majority of Harput’s
    citizens left at the beginning of the century, the church has
    remained, strong and beautiful atop the cliff with a vast plain
    extending beneath it. The church has a cavernous feel to
    it, and when one enters, one is greeted by beautiful icons and
    the smells of candles and incense. The pilgrims came for the
    feast of Mary on August 15, after fasting six days before. On
    the day that we were there, we met Christians who had come from
    as far away as Adıyaman and other places, journeying to
    honor the Blessed Virgin Mary. The divine liturgy was
    beautifully offered, in Syriac, Arabic and Turkish, and
    afterwards we feasted with the others who had journeyed there
    at a café overlooking the modern Elazığ below.
    The community was remarkably friendly.</p>

            <anchor corresp="P32"/>[32]
    Later that day we had the treat of visiting the historic
    restored house in Harput with an energetic and witty guide,
    Rabban Melke, who rattled off a spirited tour in Syriac,
    Arabic, and Turkish. A house there has been restored in
    order to show the way people used to live in Harput, and there
    are plans to expand the complex in coming years. They proudly
    took out the architectural plans to show us. Rabban Melke
    showed us around the house. A few of us then went to explore
    the fortress of Harput following the visit.</p>

            <anchor corresp="P33"/>[33] On
    our last day, we drove out to Malatya/Melitene, once the center
    of Syriac Orthodoxy in the days of such men as Patriarch
    Michael I, Dionysius bar Salibi and Bar Hebraeus. Thanks to
    Hidemi’s and George’s endless curiosity, our drive
    to Melitene took us “off the beaten track” in order
    to glean more information about the abandoned Armenian churches
    we passed along the way. We crossed (or ran on foot) over
    the Euphrates and stepped out of the van to drink in the beauty
    of the natural surroundings. We spotted the sign of a
    church/monastery on our map, and then we decided to backtrack a
    bit in order to discover more about it. Our drivers stopped
    along the side of the road in order to ask some local farmers
    where we should go. They instructed us, and then after
    learning that we were Christians, launched into a theological
    discussion with us. They wanted to know how it was that
    Christians believed that Jesus was God. I was impressed at
    their curiosity, but as we had left our notes on Nicene
    Christology at the hotel, we continued on our way in search of
    the church. Up through the thorny bushy path we climbed until
    we reached the ruins of an Ottoman fort on top of the
    hill. We never, alas, found the monastery of Tomisa.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P34"/>[34] We
    continued on to Malatya, which is the <hi rend="italic">mishmish</hi> or
    apricot capital of Turkey, where we drove through the orchards,
    searching for the remnants of Byzantine and Seljukid
    Melitene. In Eski (or Old) Malatya, the walls of the city,
    whose construction began under Trajan and was continued by
    Diocletian and Justinian, can still be visited. Little else
    remains in Eski Malatya from its Byzantine days, but the Ulu
    Cami (Great Mosque), constructed by the Seljuks, stands much in
    the same way as it did in Bar Hebraeus’ time. A little
    way away from Eski Malatya, after a bit of circling in and out
    of the apricot orchards near the Hittite ruins of Arslantepe,
    we found the remains of a church, which we deduced to have been
    Armenian.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P35"/>[35] We
    asked the local farmer about what the church was, and he was
    hesitant to share much. Then, when Said our driver spoke to him
    in Turkish, and obfuscated the fact that we were a group of
    Christians, the farmer proceeded to share with pride how his
    forefathers had driven the “infidels,” i.e. the
    Armenians, from the area. The joy with which he recounted the
    atrocities committed against the Christians was chilling and
    harsh reminder of the sufferings that the former Christian
    inhabitants had experienced.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P36"/>[36] As
    we left the area of Elazığ and drove back to
    Diyarbakır, my heart was heavy to leave this place that I
    had longed to visit my whole life. We stopped in Diyarbakir
    before going back to Istanbul, and we climbed on top of its
    basalt walls, walking around the city and looking one last time
    towards the Tigris flowing away. The senior citizens of
    Diyarbakir congregate under its walls.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P37"/>[37] Each
    memory from this trip is impressed indelibly on my mind. More
    than the beauty of the surroundings and the architecture, I
    will remember the faces that we met. Thank you to our wonderful
    group!! May this be the first of many such trips! May we honor
    through our scholarship the living heirs and transmitters of
    the Suryoyo culture and history!</p>_______<lb/>

            <anchor corresp="P1"/>[1] Opposite
    the title page of Gary Anderson’s monograph, <hi rend="italic">The
    Genesis of Perfection</hi>, the author lists “Three
    Theses,” each with a supporting citation:</p>
         <p>Thesis One states, “In Judaism, creation is
    understood through the revelation at Mount Sinai.” 
    The supporting reference is from the rabbinic midrashic text
    <hi rend="italic">Genesis Rabbah</hi>.</p>
         <p>Thesis Two offers the other tradition, “In
    Christianity, creation is understood through the advent and
    passion of Christ.”  The <hi rend="italic">Martyrology of
    Jerome</hi> provides the text.</p>
         <p>Thesis Three gives Anderson’s conclusion,
    “Adam and Eve did not thwart the designs of God but,
    paradoxically, advanced them.”  Adam’s words
    after the fall from John Milton’s <hi rend="italic">Paradise Lost</hi>
    poetically declare the assurance of the ultimate triumph.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P2"/>[2]
    Considering the richness and depth of Anderson’s
    exposition of the interpretation of the Genesis 1:26-4:2
    narrative in rabbinic, patristic, literary, liturgical, and
    artistic sources, it is remarkable how he is able to
    encapsulate the argument so succinctly.  Anderson could
    stop here, mission accomplished.  Fortunately, Anderson
    has invited his readers to delight in the diverse and
    entertaining details of the argument.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P3"/>[3]
    Anderson, professor of Old Testament at Harvard Divinity
    School, notes in his Preface that his scholarship has been both
    in the history of composition, primarily the
    historical-critical method; and in the history of reception or
    interpretation.  Most Old Testament scholarship has been
    weighted towards the former, but in this work Anderson shifts
    the balance to interpretation.  This is not simply to
    balance matters for the sake of equanimity and objectivity, but
    because he believes that it is in interpretation by the
    religious communities we understand what is most important in
    the text.  Anderson does provide the balancing concerns of
    historical-criticism, but consigns them to Appendix A
    (“Biblical Origins and the Fall”).  Perhaps
    form reveals preference, for the body of his monograph is
    clearly focused on the history of reception and how the story
    is retold in a variety of genres.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P4"/>[4] The
    tension between these two disciplines is real.  The Bible,
    while relating the adventures of Adam and Eve in the Garden of
    Eden in terse but provocative fashion, seemingly dispenses with
    the tale and its typologies in Genesis, not mentioning the
    scene again until Paul’s 5th chapter of the Letter to the
    Romans.  So much for the critical influence of Eden upon
    the Biblical message.  Nevertheless, for synagogue and
    church the story of the beginnings directs us to the last and
    perfect fulfillment of the human-divine relationship. 
    Judaism and Christianity, having lived and still living the
    story, have found no problem contributing to and filling out
    its details.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P5"/>[5] Knowing
    how the story will end helps to determine where it should be
    going: such is Anderson’s basic principle for how Jewish
    and Christian readers modify and endow the Biblical text with
    more meaning.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P6"/>[6]
    Anderson’s method is to listen to all sorts of voices
    that reflect the traditions about Adam and Eve.  To
    determine his favorite voice would be difficult.  Probably
    the apocryphal  <hi rend="italic">Life of Adam and Eve</hi> ranks foremost
    (an English translation of the Armenian version by Michael
    Stone and Anderson is Appendix C).  <hi rend="italic">Genesis Rabbah</hi>
    and several other witnesses to rabbinic commentary are utilized
    frequently.  The most numerous citations come from the
    Puritan John Milton’s poem <hi rend="italic">Paradise Lost</hi>, which
    Anderson believes owes much to Milton possibly being familiar
    with the <hi rend="italic">Life of Adam and Eve</hi> or at least its
    scenario.  Dante receives some air time as well.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P7"/>[7] Of
    course, the reason we are here with this book review is
    Anderson’s reliance upon Ephrem the Syrian for an
    interpretation of Adam and Eve in Eden from a Semitic Christian
    perspective.  Ephrem is not the only Eastern Church voice,
    as Anderson calls upon Bar Hebraeus, Narsai, and Theodore of
    Mopsuestia to offer witness to the development of the Adam and
    Eve story.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P8"/>[8] Anderson
    begins the journey uniquely by exegeting Michelangelo’s
    painting of the temptation of Adam and Eve on the ceiling of
    the Sistine Chapel.  Somebody got to Michelangelo’s
    theology; Anderson surmises it could well have been Egidio da
    Viterbo, a contemporary intellectual at the papal court who
    helped revive interest and research into Augustine.  Adam
    and the serpent are depicted straining towards each other,
    muscles tensed.  Eve remains reclining and relaxed between
    the two, her right middle finger pointing directly at her
    genitalia.  Anderson sees a double meaning or symbolism in
    the gesture - Eve points to the cause of the Fall (sexuality),
    as well as the cause of salvation (the birth of Christ). 
    Eve has now become Mary.  One knows where one is going
    when one begins at the end.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P9"/>[9] The
    beginning, however, takes place at creation, or even before
    it.  “Let us make man in our own image,” God
    addressed the angelic host.  This is an act of elevation
    by God of human beings over the angels, an enthronement, at
    which some angels, especially Satan, took umbrage. 
    Another instance of the younger-superseding-the-elder theme is
    before us: Adam who was created after the angels now has
    primacy.  Psalm 8:4 – “What is man that thou
    art mindful of him?” - is interpreted in rabbinic
    tradition as the outraged cry of the rebel angels. 
    Desiring to put the interloper in his place, Satan plots to
    entrap Adam with the help of the serpent.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P10"/>[10]
    Israel too is elevated and elected above the older nations as
    God’s very own people and the recipients of God’s
    Torah, just as Christian tradition perceives that God elevated
    and elected Jesus as God’s Messiah.  To be the
    beloved son is to be elected to die, but when the Son
    volunteers to empty himself and go to earth for the sake of the
    fallen Adam, he receives the greatest of honours.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P11"/>[11]
    Where Adam knew Eve is essential spiritual geography, which
    finds rabbinic and Christian interpreters at odds with one
    another.  Sexuality is not condemned as sinful <hi rend="italic">per
    se</hi>, but where it happens is critical for its
    interpretation.  Christian interpreters—Anderson
    relies heavily here upon Ephrem—understand Eden as sacred
    space, similar to the Jerusalem Temple.  As a holy place,
    one can only be in it if one is in a state of purity befitting
    the image of God.  Christians, therefore, read that Adam
    and Eve could have had sexual relations only outside the
    Garden.  Jewish commentators believed, on the other hand,
    that Adam and Eve did know one another inside the Garden, and
    that Eden was not a sacred space. </p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P12"/>[12]
    Anderson turns to Augustine who argued against the Pelagian
    position that the gospel could transform human nature as an
    exercise of the freedom of the human will.  Sainthood and
    perfection were possible for all, according to Pelagius, but
    Augustine knew that if perfection were possible, it would be
    obligatory for all.  Complete human freedom would be
    oppressive, making the human being responsible for every action
    taken—and severely punishable as well.  The dilemma
    with sexuality, Augustine presses, is that the harmonious
    relationship between erotic desire and bodily obedience -
    bodies behaving in perfect concord with their will—had
    been disrupted.  The imbalances of lust and impotence are
    proof of this discontinuity. </p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P13"/>[13] Sex
    in Eden?  God was making the arrangements for the
    connubial bed in the Garden, but Adam and Eve were too quick to
    sin and did not have time to consummate their marriage. 
    Now the sexual organs themselves are seen as the culprits,
    operating independently of the will of the
    individual.   Eden being no sacred space, Augustine
    places the struggle for sexual self-control back into the arena
    of monastic life, for even the greatest monks are not immune
    from the impetuosity of the sexual organs.  This was a
    radical, uncomfortable, and unwelcome idea for the defenders of
    the monastic life.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P14"/>[14] The
    focus shifts to Eve’s role in sin and salvation. 
    Eve knows of the prohibition regarding the tree of knowledge,
    but in response to the serpent seemingly makes an addition that
    one should not touch, as well as not eat from the tree. 
    The rabbis believed that it was Adam who added touching to the
    list as one would do to protect a small child from harm. 
    The serpent took advantage of this, demonstrating that since
    touching is not fatal, so eating would not be
    either.   Ephrem writes that both Adam and Eve heard
    the two commands together, especially that one should not come
    near the tree of knowledge for it guarded the inner sanctum of
    the tree of life.  This two-chambered geography of Eden is
    unique among Christian and Jewish interpreters.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P15"/>[15] Eve
    now merges into Mary and Mary is only really comprehended in
    light of Eve.  As the <hi rend="italic">theotokos</hi>, Mary is an active
    participant in the incarnation, sanctifying the womb profaned
    in Eden.  In <hi rend="italic">The Protoevangelium of James</hi>, Joseph
    despairs over Mary’s pregnancy having left her alone and
    unattended, just as Eve was deceived by the serpent when she
    was alone, unattended either by Adam or the angels.  So
    when Mary encounters Gabriel, she is reluctant to assent until
    she has figured out the truth of what is to happen, lest she be
    deceived like Eve.  While Abraham is praised for assenting
    to God’s command without hesitation and without comment,
    Mary is commended for her shrewdness and caution.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P16"/>[16] The
    persistent issue whether Eve is the source of sin finds its
    critical mass in 1 Timothy 2:14-15.  Anderson enjoins
    Origen, Ephrem, Augustine, and finally Milton to lift the blame
    off Eve’s shoulders.  Origen sees the first couple
    not as types for all men and all women, but Adam is the one who
    points to God’s Christ, while Eve represents all
    God’s church, male and female.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P17"/>[17]
    Ephrem treats Adam and Eve as equally guilty, believing that
    prior to transgression they were clothed in glory.  At the
    decisive moment, they were physically transformed in a visible
    way, signified by the discovery of their own nakedness. 
    Ephrem not only takes the burden of full guilt from Eve, he
    chastises Adam for cowardly dissembling before God.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P18"/>[18]
    Augustine is nearly modern in his Biblical interpretation, not
    allowing 1 Timothy to usurp Paul’s verdict on Adam
    (“sin came into the world through one man”) in
    Romans 5:12-21, for the latter proceeds from the heart of
    Paul’s theology.  That Adam was not deceived did not
    mean he was innocent.  It simply meant that Adam’s
    sin differed in manner from Eve’s, but his sin was more a
    result of his free will, and thus worthy of more blame.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P19"/>[19] The
    act of transgression is done, and now the rest of life must be
    lived.  The garments of skin God fashioned for the naked
    couple before they had to leave Eden has attracted much
    speculation.  Changing garments/robes as one moves from
    one level of holiness to another is the pattern of priests in
    the Temple. If Eden were sacred ground, then Adam’s
    holiness would have been similar to a priest’s. 
    Some rabbinic writers saw the garments of skin as mortal human
    flesh, not as a separate piece of clothing to be put on or
    taken off.  So Adam and Eve did die when they ate of the
    fruit—eventually, not immediately.  Exile was a kind
    of protection for Adam and Eve, for to remain before God in
    Eden, while defiled by sin, was to court danger and death.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P20"/>[20]
    Baptismal liturgies adopted the imagery of clothing and
    garments of skin.  The one about to be baptized is
    stripped naked of the garments inherited from Adam, then
    dressed in garments he or she shall wear at the
    resurrection.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P21"/>[21]
    Exiled from Eden, were Adam and Eve punished eternally or
    instead engaged in a long penance?  The Christian model
    for penance comes from a surprising person: King Nebuchadnezzar
    (Daniel 4) who is driven out of Babylon and becomes like a
    beast of the field.  In the Greek versions of the story,
    the evil king repents, confesses God, and is restored. 
    Tertullian lifts up Nebuchadnezzar’s penance as
    exemplary, for if this terrible person could be saved, then no
    one would be beyond God’s mercy.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P22"/>[22] The
    initial punishment of Adam and Eve consisted of being condemned
    to eat the grass of the field normally intended for
    animals.  The <hi rend="italic">Life of Adam and Eve</hi> records that the
    couple had only the food of the animals to eat, but after
    tremendous penance God took notice and gave them seed to grow
    cereals.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P23"/>[23]
    Ephrem returns to the example of Nebuchadnezzar whom he
    perceives as a second Adam, representing the entire human
    condition in summary, both in his/our fall and in his/our
    repentance.  The fate of Adam and Nebuchadnezzar to dwell
    among and eat like animals becomes a form of the ascetic life
    in the Syriac church.  No longer mere penance, the lives
    of the holy men and women in Egypt and Syria, whether
    “grazers” as above or stylites like the famous
    Simeon, are described in the language of glory.  Anderson
    cites Sebastian Brock’s article on early Syriac
    asceticism that “this style of life was in fact a return
    to...the life of Adam in Paradise before the
    Fall.” </p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P24"/>[24] At
    first glance, Anderson finds this lifestyle more like Adam
    outside Eden and therefore incongruous with a redeemed Adam
    living inside Eden.  But then Anderson stumbled upon a
    modern Hasidic story by Israeli novelist Shai Agnon about a
    holy woman Tehillah who lavishes her financial resources, time
    and energy on Jerusalem’s poor and destitute. 
    Anderson recognized that by treating such hardship and
    asceticism as penance rather than punishment, the holy men and
    women progressed towards deification.  By imitating Adam
    outside Eden, the early Christian monks were assuring
    themselves of a place inside Eden.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P25"/>[25] The
    last chapter of the story appears initially to be outside the
    realm of the Eden saga.   Anderson examines the
    “harrowing of hell,” with Dante’s
    <hi rend="italic">Inferno</hi> and the apocryphal <hi rend="italic">Gospel of Nicodemus</hi>
    (English translation of pertinent sections included as Appendix
    D) as principal sources.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P26"/>[26] As a
    consequence of the Fall, Satan has obtained legitimate rights
    over humanity.  Cohort Hades or Death has the right to
    bring every human being into his realm.  But Death cannot
    figure out Jesus, for while he performs acts of divine power,
    he is most human in other respects.  Yet Hades cannot
    resist the temptation and takes Jesus on Good Friday.  In
    death Jesus’ power is revealed, one that can only be
    activated by weakness.  Entering the kingdom of death,
    Jesus raises up Adam and Eve.  The point Anderson stresses
    is that the kingdom of Hades is lamentable but just, so God
    cannot appeal on grounds of reason, but overturns the power of
    Hades by an act of deception.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P27"/>[27]
    Satan, in some circumstances, represents the powers of justice,
    so the God who is merciful has to resort to a different
    tact.  A thoroughly just world would leave no room for
    human beings, Anderson concludes, so God must deceive
    himself.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P28"/>[28]
    Anderson calls again upon Ephrem to interpret this narrative
    through sections in <hi rend="italic">Carmina Nisibena</hi>.  Ephrem does
    not perceive Death as a rebel angel, but as a servant who
    performs justly what he has been commanded.  Death opens
    the door for Christ, announces him to all therein, and on
    bended knee declares that he is Christ’s servant
    forever.  In his <hi rend="italic">Commentary on the Diatessaron</hi>
    Ephrem shows that it was fortunate that Abel was the first to
    enter Sheol, for having been murdered by Cain he had to enter
    unjustly.  If Adam had been the first to enter, his
    sentence would have been justly deserved and he would have been
    condemned to stay there forever.  Ephrem, like other
    patristic writers, sees Abel as a type of Christ, who dies
    unfairly and gives God the moral authority to rescue Adam, who
    represents all humanity, from the bonds of Sheol.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P29"/>[29] The
    strength of this book lies in a number of its features. 
    Engagingly written in a style neither condescending to the
    scholar, nor overly technical for the lay reader, the book
    features attractive plates of paintings and diagrams of
    concepts.  The paintings are not there for mere
    illustration, but lead the reader through primary insights into
    the argument.  Likewise, his reliance upon Dante and
    especially Milton widen the intellectual field for

    addition to attaching the appendices of the <hi rend="italic">Life of Adam and
    Eve</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Gospel of Nicodemus</hi>, Anderson offers a
    useful Glossary of theological terms, biographical notices, and
    historical references that should especially aid the
    non-specialist.   The same is the case for Appendix
    B, an annotated text of Genesis 1-3 (actually, a few verses
    from Genesis 4 and 5 are tacked on).  End notes give the
    appropriate references for quotations, and a General
    Bibliography helps fill out the research and thought on a
    particular theme.</p>

    Naturally, Anderson’s most significant contribution from
    the perspective of readers of this journal is his utilization
    of Ephrem and other Syriac and Eastern Christian writers as
    primary witnesses to a topic of universal interest.  Of
    course, a plea could be heard for integrating more examples
    from Syriac literature and tradition, but Anderson’s
    efforts have been appropriately balanced.  Other scholars
    will fill in the gaps and addenda in time.  Hopefully,
    this work will open the gates for other monographs on Biblical,
    theological, and historical themes that will introduce the
    scholarly public to the wealth of the East.</p>

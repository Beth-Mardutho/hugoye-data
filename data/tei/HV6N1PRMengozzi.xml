    Well-known among Syriac scholars for the publication of the
    concordances to the Peshitta Pentateuch (Leiden 1997), in 2000
    Pier Giorgio Borbone published an Italian translation with an
    extensive commentary of the <hi rend="italic">History of the Life and Travels
    of Rabban Sawma, Envoy and Plenipotentiary of the Mongol Khans
    to three Kings of Europe, and Markos who as Mar Yahbhallaha III
    became Patriarch of the Nestorian Church in Asia</hi>, as it was
    titled in the first complete English translation by E.A.W.
    Budge (London 1928). Budge's work followed a Neo-Aramaic
    translation made in Urmia (Persia, North-West Iran) by a
    certain priest Oshana and published in <hi rend="italic">Zahrire d-Bahra</hi>
    (Urmia 1885-1886), the French translation by J.B. Chabot
    (<hi rend="italic">Revue de l'Orient Latin</hi> 1893-1896) and the partial
    English translation by J.A. Montgomery (London 1927). A number
    of translations in other languages are available: Russian by
    N.V. Pingulevskaja (Moscow 1958), German by F. Altheim (Berlin
    1961), Neo-Aramaic (Kirkuk 1961), and the partial Arabic
    translation by L. Sako (<hi rend="italic">Bayn al-Nahrayn</hi> 1974).</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P2"/>[2] The
    Classical Syriac text was discovered by the American missionary
    Isaac Hollister Hall (notice published in <hi rend="italic">JAOS</hi> 1889) and
    soon aroused much interest both in the East and in the West.
    The Lazarist Father Paul Bedjan corrected and published the
    text of the <hi rend="italic">History</hi> preserved in a single Urmi
    manuscript (1888). A few years later, Bedjan prepared a
    critical edition based on the collation of four other
    manuscripts (Paris-Leipzig 1895). All manuscripts apparently
    derive from one archetype and date from the Eighties of the
    19th century.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P3"/>[3] Borbone
    approaches the <hi rend="italic">History of Mar Yahbhallaha and Rabban
    Sawma</hi> as a philologist and historian and covers the
    temporal and spatial dimensions of the text with the curiosity
    and enthusiasm of an experienced traveler.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P4"/>[4] From a
    text-critical point of view, Borbone follows the steps of the
    editor and of the various translators, but he does not hesitate
    to suggest his own conjectures, correcting and improving the
    text as it appears in the manuscripts. All critical choices
    which have effects on the translation are accurately explained
    in the footnotes. The corrected phrases are sometimes
    transcribed in East-Syriac characters. It is thus immediately
    clear how graphic similarities may have caused scribal
    errors.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P5"/>[5] Preface
    and introduction (p. 9-49) provide the reader with factual
    information on the history of the text and its discovery, a
    general presentation of contents, literary genre, linguistic
    and stylistic remarks. The text is dated on the basis of
    internal evidence (p.16). The <hi rend="italic">terminus post quem</hi> is
    November 1317 A.D., when Mar Yahballaha died. His death is the
    last episode related by the author of the <hi rend="italic">History</hi>. The
    mention of an emir who died in 1319 A.D. is accompanied by the
    formula ‘may he be preserved in life’ and gives the
    <hi rend="italic">terminus ante quem</hi> for the date of composition.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P6"/>[6] The
    pages of the introduction in which the historical context of
    the <hi rend="italic">History</hi> is explained are particularly interesting
    and very useful for the reader, specialist or non-specialist
    alike. Borbone presents clear and well-informed surveys on the
    following subjects: Mongolian rule over Iran (p. 27-32), the
    Mongols in 13th-century European culture (32-34), the Church of
    the East in the broader context of Syrian Christianity, its
    literature and relationship with the Mongols and, more in
    general, with Muslim rulers (34-42), the East-Syrian mission
    and presence in China and Central Asia (42-49).</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P7"/>[7] The
    <hi rend="italic">History of Rabban Sawma and Mar Yahballaha</hi> aims at
    presenting a complete biography of the two protagonists,
    together with an account of the most salient events of the
    historical  period in which they lived and acted (p. 55).
    A Christian Mongol, called (Bar‑)Sawma, an East-Syrian
    monk and therefore given the appropriate title Rabban, led a
    diplomatic mission in Europe in 1287-1288 as an emissary of the
    khan Arghun, Mongolian ruler over Iran. He visited
    Constantinople, Naples, Rome, Genoa, Paris. In Naples he met
    the king <hi rend="italic">Irid Shardalo</hi> (a somewhat distorted rendering
    of <hi rend="italic">roi Charles II</hi>, read as <hi rend="italic">deux</hi>; with a
    prosthetic <hi rend="italic">i</hi> before the <hi rend="italic">r</hi> of <hi rend="italic">roi</hi>, as is
    common in Turkish and Mongolian, and the metathesis of
    <hi rend="italic">sharlado</hi> to <hi rend="italic">shardalo</hi>: see p. 79 and 154). In Rome
    Rabban Sawma brilliantly sustained a doctrinal discussion with
    the cardinals. In the way the discussion and the cardinals'
    positive reaction are reported, it is not difficult to
    recognize a kind of apology by a proud member of the Church of
    the East. In Paris he met the king of France (called
    ‘King Fransis’) and in Guascogne (<hi rend="italic">ksonia</hi>)
    the king of England (<hi rend="italic">ilnagtar</hi>). The author of the
    <hi rend="italic">History</hi> says he has included a selection of Rabban
    Sawma's travel report which was originally written in Persian
    (p. 93).</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P8"/>[8] The
    second part of the <hi rend="italic">History</hi> describes the work of Mark,
    who was a Christian Mongol like Rabban Sawma, became monk and
    was appointed as Patriarch of the Church of the East with the
    name of Yahballaha III. He served his Church mostly in
    diplomatic contacts with the court of the Mongols, trying to
    defend himself and the Christian communities from the frequent
    acts of harassment, extortion, ravage, torture, massacre
    perpetrated by local Muslim rulers. The author lingers over the
    description and comment on the siege and attack on the citadel
    of Arbil, which ended in a tremendous massacre of the
    Christians (p. 124-147).</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P9"/>[9]
    Borbone's interest in reconstructing the historical context of
    the <hi rend="italic">History</hi> comes to the fore in the commentary and
    appendices (p. 149-268) which are about the same length as the
    translation (p. 53-148). The work of the historian is
    characterized by a critical study of the available documents
    and, accordingly, Borbone's commentary offers the reader a good
    discussion of various sources: archaeological and epigraphic
    evidence from Central Asia and China, travel reports of the
    XIII-XIV centuries (Giovanni di Pian di Carpine, Guillaume de
    Rubrouck, Marco Polo, Ricoldo da Monte Croce, Odorico da
    Pordenone, Ibn Battuta), historiographical works (Bar Hebraeus,
    ‘Ata-Malik Juvaini, Rashid al-Din, Khwandamir, Grigor of
    Akanc’, Hayton) and, of course, secondary literature on
    the Mongols and the Church of the East. Texts are often
    extensively reported in Italian translation.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P10"/>[10] The
    appendices contain the Italian translation of various texts: a
    biography in Arabic of Mar Yahballaha (p. 247-251, translated
    by Emanuela Braida), a metrical homily written in honor of Mar
    Yahballaha (p. 251-253), some passages of Bar Hebraeus'
    <hi rend="italic">Chronography</hi> (p. 253-254), and three diplomatic
    documents (p. 255-259). Borbone then adds considerations on the
    <hi rend="italic">History</hi> as a piece of travel literature (p. 261-264), a
    discussion of historical problems which will require further
    research to find a definitive solution (p. 265-268), an
    impressive bibliography (p. 269-293), index (295-297), and two
    maps.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P11"/>[11]
    Throughout the book, the commentator correctly stresses the
    value of the <hi rend="italic">History</hi> as a historical document, here and
    there containing information which can be regarded as
    ‘first-hand’ or very close to the events. More
    attention might have been paid to the theological and religious
    framework in which the narrative of contemporary history is
    inserted. The author of the text clearly sees history as the
    actual manifestation of God's plans and promises (p. 21-22).
    This is evident not only in the introduction and in the almost
    hagiographical account of the childhood of Sawma and Mark in
    the far East, as observed by Borbone (p. 19, n. 2), but it also
    informs the whole narrative: an angel saves the Patriarch (p.
    74); the personages experience revelatory or therapeutic dreams
    (e.g., p. 74 and 119). The frequent gnomic or moralistic
    comments of the author certainly have a stylistic function (p.
    24), but they also underline the author's faith in the leading
    role of Divine Providence and Justice in human history.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P12"/>[12] As a
    comment on the massacre of the Christians in Arbil, the author
    attributes to Mar Yahballaha an interpretation of
    <hi rend="italic">Lamentations</hi> 1,19-22 adapted for his own day. In the
    words of the prophet, the Patriarch would have prayed God to
    look at the wickedness of ‘these Hagarens’ (the
    Muslims): ‘Deal with them as you have dealt with me
    because of all my sins’. Later on in the text (p.
    144-145), the author takes over the role of interpreter himself
    and writes a kind of collage of verses taken from the book of
    <hi rend="italic">Lamentations</hi>. This way of reading and retelling history
    — catastrophic events, either natural or caused by Muslim
    oppressors, befall Christian communities because of their sins
    —is customary in the late East-Syriac liturgical texts
    (see D. Bundy on the 13th-century author George Warda, more or
    less contemporary with the <hi rend="italic">History</hi>; <hi rend="italic">The Harp</hi> 6
    (1993) 7-20) and their Neo-Syriac continuation: hymns on
    pestilence, wars, famines, etc. (<hi rend="italic">Le Muséon</hi> 112
    (1999) 478-479).</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P13"/>[13] As
    far as sources and literary models are concerned, Borbone
    mentions possible analogies between our <hi rend="italic">History</hi> and the
    style of contemporary Persian and Arabic literature on history
    and geography (p. 24-25). One might add that the rather vague
    formulas which describe events preceding the year 1295 (p. 99)
    have the flavor of astrological literature.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P14"/>[14]
    Following in the opposite direction Rabban Sawma's itineraries
    from China to Mesopotamia and from Mesopotamia to Europe,
    Borbone's commentary leads the reader on a fascinating journey
    through the manners and customs of Syrians and Mongols.
    Geographic descriptions, ethnographical and anthropological
    remarks give information on the way tents were made, food was
    prepared, the prince was addressed at his camp/court, which
    routes were chosen, how power was organized and imposed. The
    etymology and cultural implication of the loanwords from
    Turkish and Mongolian are accurately explained. Arabic
    <hi rend="italic">diibaaj</hi> probably derives from Persian <hi rend="italic">diibaa</hi> (see
    Brockelmann <hi rend="italic">Lexicon Syriacum</hi> 138a, Steingass
    <hi rend="italic">Persian-English Dictionary</hi>, Redhouse <hi rend="italic">A Turkish and
    English Lexicon</hi>) and not Persian <hi rend="italic">diibaa</hi> from Arabic,
    as suggested by Borbone (p. 96, n. 4).</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P15"/>[15] With
    its critical approach to the text, documented reconstruction of
    the historical context, broad and articulated commentary, this
    book cannot be simply regarded as a new translation of the
    <hi rend="italic">History of Rabban Sawma and Mar Yahballaha</hi>. Pier Giorgio
    Borbone brings much new information about and around the text
    and outlines new perspectives in research on the history of the
    Middle East in the Mongolian period and on the Christian
    presence in Central Asia and China. With improvements in the
    system of transliteration of Classical Syriac and corrections
    in the transcription of Arabic, an English edition is strongly
    recommended so that it may reach the wider readership it
    deserves.</p>

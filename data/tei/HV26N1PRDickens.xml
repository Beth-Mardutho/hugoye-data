            <p  xml:lang="en">The present volume contains eleven contributions from
                experts in the history of the Church of the East in China and Central Asia, the
                fruit of a 2015 international conference on the topic held in Hong Kong. The book is
                divided into three parts: The Church of the East in Central Asia, The Church of the
                East in Tang and Yuan China, and The Art and Iconography of the Church of the East.
                A Foreword by <hi rend="bold">Florian Knothe</hi> of the University of Hong Kong
                introduces the volume, focusing specifically on the F.A. Nixon Collection of bronze
                “Nestorian” crosses kept at the University of Hong Kong. These items, one of which
                is featured on the cover, originated in the Ordos region (located in Inner
                Mongolia); they feature a mixture of Christian and Buddhist symbols (including
                animal shapes and geometric patterns) and were likely used as seals. The Foreword is
                accompanied by two images of these Ordos bronzes.</p>
            <p  xml:lang="en">The initial section of the book, focussing on Central Asia,
                contains three chapters. The first, by <hi rend="bold">Erica Hunter</hi>, concerns
                the fragmentary Syriac manuscript MIK III 45 from Turfan (in Xinjiang, China), now
                kept in Berlin and dated to the 8<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>/9<hi
                    rend="superscript">th</hi> cent. The text, “the most intact manuscript that has
                been discovered to date at Turfan” (p. 2), contains various offices, rites and
                anthems of the Church of the East. After a brief discussion of the manuscript
                contents and possible place of origin (including the notion that it might have been
                produced somewhere in Central Asia, where the Church of the East had a number of
                metropolitan bishops), the author focusses on the saints commemorated in MIK III 45:
                Mart Shir, Mar Bar Shabba and Zarvandukht, followed by Mar Sargis. All can be
                connected to Central Asia; the first three, according to legend, evangelized Merv
                (in modern-day Turkmenistan), while Mar Sargis (martyred together with Bacchus at
                Resafa, Syria) became a popular saint in Central Asia. Their connections with the
                broader region may thus explain why these particular saints were highlighted in the
                liturgy at Turfan. An image from the manuscript in question is appended to the
                chapter.</p>
            <p  xml:lang="en">Chapter two, a discussion of Sogdian biblical manuscripts from
                Turfan, is by <hi rend="bold">Nicholas Sims-Williams</hi> and focusses on the large
                number of biblical texts found at Turfan that were translated from Syriac into
                Sogdian, a Middle Iranian language spoken throughout Central Asia for many
                centuries. The author begins with an overview of the Turfan biblical fragments in
                all languages before concentrating on those that are in Sogdian, including bilingual
                (Syriac–Sogdian) lectionaries in Syriac script and Psalters in Sogdian script (among
                which are two fragments with Greek headlines). An extended and interesting
                examination of the evidence for Sogdian translation techniques – whether from the
                Peshitta or, more rarely, the Septuagint – is followed by a more in-depth discussion
                of “the best-preserved gospel lectionary E5 and the relationship of its text to the
                Peshitta” (p. 17), a discussion that those interested in grammar will particularly
                enjoy.</p>
            <p  xml:lang="en"><hi rend="bold">Hidemi Takahashi</hi>’s contribution is the
                third chapter in Part One (although it might equally have been included in Part Two,
                given that it deals with Christian texts from both China and Central Asia). It
                focuses in particular on the degree to which Syriac was known and used by Christians
                in China and adjacent areas during the two eras when the faith flourished there,
                namely the Tang dynasty (7th–10th cent.) and the Mongol Yuan dynasty (13th–14th
                cent.). For the Tang period, when Christianity was known as the religion of
                Jingjiao, the author gives a detailed examination of the Syriac and Iranian (Middle
                Persian and Sogdian) words underlying Chinese terms in 1) the Dunhuang Jingjiao
                texts (7th and 8th cent.), 2) the Xi’an Stele (8th cent.), 3) the Luoyang pillar
                (9th cent.), 4) a 9th-cent. funerary inscription, 5) the Manichaean texts from
                Fujian and 6) the Prayer of St. George, along with 7) the encyclopedic work <hi
                    rend="italic">Youyang zazu</hi> (which includes a number of plant names
                transliterated in Chinese that reflect underlying Syriac names). However, there is
                scant evidence to draw conclusions from the assembled data; although we may assume
                that ecclesiastics (including monks) of the Church of the East during this time
                “probably made up the bulk of the people capable of using Syriac in China… among the
                mass of the faithful there was probably only limited knowledge of Syriac at any
                time” (p. 39).</p>
            <p  xml:lang="en">Turning to the Yuan dynasty, when Christians were referred to
                as Yelikewen, Takahashi considers the same question: to what extent was Syriac known
                and used? Sources consulted include 1) the gravestone inscriptions from Quanzhou,
                Yangzhou and Inner Mongolia (most of which are in Turkic), 2) graffiti found in the
                White Pagoda near Hohhot (Inner Mongolia) and the Yulin Grottoes near Dunhuang,
                3) inscriptions from Fangshan (near Beijing) and Chifeng (Inner Mongolia), 4) the
                manuscript John Rylands Syriac 4, “the only Syriac manuscript in existence today
                which is known for sure to have been copied in the core area of China” (p. 53),
                5) another Syriac manuscript consisting of four lost leaves and fifteen leaves
                preserved in Taiwan, 6) fragments of a lectionary and the <hi rend="italic">Ktaba
                    da-qdam wad</hi>-<hi rend="italic">batar</hi> found at Dunhuang, 7) various
                Syriac manuscript fragments uncovered at Khara Khoto (Inner Mongolia), 8) statements
                by and about the Turkic Catholicos Yahbalāhā III, 9) a Syriac Gospel manuscript
                copied for the Turkic Öngüt princess Sara, and 10) Syriac rock inscriptions at Ulaan
                Tolgoi (western Mongolia). From all this data, the author concludes that “in general
                only a limited knowledge of the Syriac language existed among the faithful,” but
                that “at least some members of the clergy were not altogether incapable of
                understanding the meaning of the words they were pronouncing during the celebration
                of the liturgy” (p. 62).</p>
            <p  xml:lang="en">Part Two of the volume commences with Chapter four, in which
                    <hi rend="bold">Huaiyu Chen</hi> discusses textual sharing between Buddhist,
                Christian and Daoist communities in Tang China. The author discusses the
                aforementioned Dunhuang Jingjiao texts, Xi’an Stele and Luoyang pillar, viewing them
                not within the context of Middle Eastern and Central Asian Christian texts, but
                rather “with reference to the religious, cultural and historical milieu of medieval
                China” (p. 93). Following discussions of the introduction of Buddhism and
                Christianity (and hence their literatures) to China, the identity of those who
                translated Christian texts into Chinese and the audience for these Christian texts,
                Chen presents the data from which conclusions can be drawn about language shared
                between Buddhist, Christian and Daoist texts of the period. The major themes
                investigated are protection of the state (reflecting the transactional relationship
                that religious traditions had with the Tang dynasty), references to “deity” as light
                and the nature of eternal life. Throughout, Chinese terms and phrases used in the
                Tang era literature of the three religious traditions are compared in order to show
                ways in which they influenced and were borrowed by each other.</p>
            <p  xml:lang="en"><hi rend="bold">Max Deeg</hi>’s chapter on the <hi
                    rend="italic">Xuting-mishi-suo-jing</hi> (one of the Dunhuang Jingjiao texts) is
                the fifth in the volume. The well-argued essay (which concentrates on the title,
                content and terminology of the text in question) offers suggestions which are, in
                the author’s words, “not the final word to settle this discussion but rather serve
                to revive what I consider to be a worthwhile conversation” (p. 111). Deeg begins by
                approaching the Chinese title (likely corrupted) within the framework of the text,
                looking in the latter for clues regarding the original form and hence meaning of the
                title. In the process, as well as reworking the title into a more plausible
                reconstruction, he addresses the structure of the text, proposing its division into
                two parts (possibly indicating its origins in two separate texts): sections from the
                Sermon on the Mount and a synopsis of the Messiah’s life, death, resurrection and
                ascension. The author concludes with an appeal for new editions, translations and
                commentaries of/on these Dunhuang Jingjiao texts which contextualize them in “their
                wider political and religious context… instead of trying to read as much Christian
                theology into them as scholars have typically done in the past” (p. 118).</p>
            <p  xml:lang="en">Chapter six is co-editor <hi rend="bold">Samuel Lieu</hi>’s
                keynote address at the conference, entitled “From Rome (Daqin <hi
                    style="font-family:SimSun">大秦</hi>) to China (Zhongguo <hi
                    style="font-family:SimSun">中國</hi>): the Xi’an <hi style="font-family:SimSun"
                    >西安</hi> (Nestorian) Monument as a Bilingual and Transcultural Document.” The
                author begins with an extensive recounting of scholarship on the Xi’an Stele (noting
                in particular a persistent scholarly tendency to downplay the Syriac content on the
                monument), followed by discussions of the following terms connected to the stele
                text: Da Qin, Tarsāg, Zhongguo, Shangzuo and Fa(p)shi. Chinese <hi rend="italic">Da
                    Qin</hi> (the stele’s term for the homeland of Christianity) represents a large
                state to the west of the Parthians, originally a reference to the Seleucid realm;
                although the chapter title seems to equate the term directly with Rome, in fact its
                meaning is more nuanced. Middle Persian <hi rend="italic">Tarsāg</hi>, meaning
                “(God) fearer,” appears on the stele in Chinese garb (<hi rend="italic">dasuo</hi>)
                and was for centuries the preferred term for designating Christians in Persia and
                Central Asia; the author proposes that this term can be linked to the character <hi
                    rend="italic">jing</hi> in Jingjiao, usually translated as “luminous religion,”
                but perhaps better as “reverential religion.”</p>
            <p  xml:lang="en">The stele uses four words to designate China, including the
                standard Chinese term <hi rend="italic">Zhongguo</hi>, literally “Middle Kingdom”;
                as Lieu notes, it is strange “to find a group of Christian monks from Central Asia
                addressing China [by this] name which contains an undisguised element of
                ethnocentricity” (p. 132). Also found in the Syriac text on the stele is a word of
                Persian or Sogdian origin: <foreign xml:lang="syr"
                    >ܨܝܢܣܬܐܢ</foreign>, pronounced <hi rend="italic">Činistan</hi> in Iranian languages
                and meaning “the land of the Chin,” i.e., the Chinese. After a long and interesting
                discussion on these terms, the author turns to two words found in the Syriac section
                of the stele that are transliterations from Chinese – a rather curious occurrence,
                given that the majority of those reading the stele would have been more familiar
                with the Chinese script than the Syriac – <foreign xml:lang="syr">ܫܝܐܢܓܬܣܘܐ</foreign> (<hi rend="italic"
                    >šyʾngtswʾ</hi>), representing Chinese <hi rend="italic">shangzuo</hi>, “(on
                the) high seat” (referring to the office of an abbot) and the more enigmatic ܦܐܦܫ<hi
                    style="font-family:Estrangelo Edessadirection:rtl;">ܝ‍</hi> (<hi rend="italic"
                    >pʾpšy</hi>). An extended analysis of the latter, well worth the read, concludes
                that it was a Chinese term meaning “teacher of the Law,” transmitted through its
                Central Asian form into Syriac transliteration.</p>
            <p  xml:lang="en">Fellow editor <hi rend="bold">Glen Thompson</hi> contributes
                the seventh chapter in the volume, an examination of how others have perceived
                Jingjiao (i.e., Tang dynasty) and Yelikewenjiao (i.e., Yuan dynasty) Christians,
                particularly through the dual lenses of “foreignness” and “heresy.” The article is
                in fact an overview of scholarship on Tang and Yuan dynasty Christianity, beginning
                with the foreign elements in texts referring to Tang dynasty Christianity – such as
                “the imperial edict of 745 which mandated the group’s name change from <hi
                    rend="italic">Bosi</hi>
                <hi style="font-family:SimSun">波斯</hi> (Persian) to <hi rend="italic">Daqin</hi> 大秦
                (Western)” (p. 144) – and proceeding to the Mongol era, when the “foreign” element
                that the many Turkic Christians of the time brought with them was compounded by the
                views of Latin travellers to China that these Christians were primarily “Nestorians”
                and hence heretics (interestingly though, the Turkic monks Rabban Ṣauma and Marqos
                were not viewed this way when they travelled to the Middle East and Europe). The
                author’s survey continues through the Ming and Qing dynasties (14th–20th cent.),
                from Chinese associates of Matteo Ricci to Athanasius Kircher (who famously
                connected the Xi’an stele to Coptic Christianity!) to others who inevitably referred
                to the stele as “the Nestorian monument.”</p>
            <p  xml:lang="en">In the early and mid-19th cent., fuelled in large part by
                China’s gradual opening to the West, the Anglicans and other Protestants joined the
                ecumenical mix of scholars and missionaries interested in early Chinese
                Christianity. The early 20th century saw the beginning of an interest by Chinese and
                Japanese scholars (notably Peter Yoshiro Saeki) in the topic, a tendency that has
                grown in recent decades, particularly amongst Chinese academics. At the same time,
                the 20th century has also seen the intrusion of other agendas into the discussion,
                particularly the “crass subjectivity of [Martin Palmer’s] <hi rend="italic">The
                    Jesus Sutras</hi>” with its tendency “to read modem notions of ecumenism into
                the Jingjiao documents” (p. 155), not to mention “many Christian scholars [who] want
                to read their own versions of Christian doctrine, history, and practice into the
                Jingjiao as well” (p. 156). The chapter ends with a consideration of the current
                state of scholarship on early Christianity in China.</p>
            <p  xml:lang="en"><hi rend="bold">David Wilmshurst</hi> gives us Chapter eight,
                simply titled “Interfaith Conflict in Yuan China,” which begins with an account of
                the demise of Tang dynasty Christianity and its virtual absence (as far as we can
                tell) during the subsequent Song dynasty (10th–13th cent.). With the collapse of the
                Southern Song dynasty in 1279, the Church of the East returned to China in the
                company of the conquering Mongols. However, Christian numbers were never large
                (perhaps no more than 30,000 total) and the mother church in the Middle East was
                reduced in the number of its dioceses and its influence. The author includes a
                helpful discussion of the two remaining metropolitan provinces of the Church of the
                East which existed during the Mongol era, namely, Tangut, and Katai and Ong. The
                earlier metropolitan see of Beth Sinaye had likely disappeared, despite its
                occurrence in the mid-14th-cent. list of metropolitan provinces by Ṣaliba ibn
                Yuḥanna. Wilmshurst then proceeds to give information on the relationship between
                “the Nestorians” and Latin Christians, Buddhists and Manichaeans. Regarding conflict
                with the Latins, he adduces evidence from Ricoldo da Monte Croce, William of
                Rubruck, John of Montecorvino and John of Cora; on tensions with Buddhists, he
                recounts how the behavior of Christians “was not always a good advertisement for
                their religion” (p. 173), with specific reference to Christian monasteries built by
                Mar Sargis from Samarkand on land confiscated from Buddhists. By contrast, a
                Christian gravestone discovered in Quanzhou gives evidence of cordial relations with
                the Manichaeans, with the Christian bishop Shlemon overseeing both religious
                communities in this part of southern China.</p>
            <p  xml:lang="en">Part Three of the book, concentrating on matters of art and
                iconography, consists of the last three chapters, beginning with Chapter nine by <hi
                    rend="bold">Niu Ruji</hi>, who focuses on a bronze mirror discovered “recently”
                (we are given no specific date) in Inner Mongolia. The mirror features a cross on
                its reverse, with four Syriac words from Psalm 34:6, one in each quadrant:</p>

            <p  xml:lang="en">The phrase has also been found on two other artifacts
                from northern China discussed by the author: a cornerstone from Fanshan and a
                funerary tile from Chifeng. Niu expands his exploration of the topic with
                information on Christianity among the Kerait and Öngüt Turks, as well as a listing
                of places in China where archaeological artifacts have been unearthed. The chapter
                includes seven images of the various artifacts discussed.</p>
            <p  xml:lang="en">The tenth chapter in the volume is <hi rend="bold">Ken
                    Parry</hi>’s essay on “Images in the Church of the East,” a look at the evidence
                from textual sources and art history. The chapter, which covers more than just China
                and Central Asia, begins with references to the contemporary absence of any images
                or icons in the Church of the East, which has led some to consider the Church as
                “iconophobic or aniconic.” The author traces the positive view of images
                (particularly icons) in the Church of the East, beginning with the famous <hi
                    rend="italic">mandylion</hi> mentioned in the <hi rend="italic">Teaching of
                    Addai</hi> and continuing on through to the fourteenth century, with reference
                to Gabriel of Qatar, Abraham of Bēt Ḥālē, Išoʿ bar Nun, Ḥunayn ibn Isḥāq, Išoʿyahb
                bar Malkon, Ṣaliba ibn Yuḥanna, Yahbalāhā III and the aforementioned churches built
                by Mar Sargis from Samarkand. The few instances of disapproval of icons (e.g., Elias
                of Nisibis) seem to be in part influenced by the overall context of Islam’s negative
                view of images, with authors either criticizing overuse of icons or comparing
                Christian use of them with Muslim veneration of the Qurʾan or the Kaʿbah.</p>
            <p  xml:lang="en">These references in sources from within the Church of the East
                are complemented by medieval Western sources which indicate use of images by the
                “Nestorians,” particularly in Asia (William of Rubruck, John Marignolli, John of
                Cora). There is then a long gap in the sources until the observations of Protestant
                missionaries to the Middle East in the early 19th cent., all of which indicate that
                the “Assyrian” Christians were by then “unaware of their own history and the
                tradition that supported the veneration of images” (p. 195). As Parry notes, the
                strongly-held Protestant position of these missionaries undoubtedly played a role in
                the observations they made on Assyrian views of images. The final section of the
                chapter concerns what we can learn from archeological and art historical sources,
                especially related to church architecture and adornment (or lack thereof). After
                acknowledging some of the hurdles to be overcome in addressing the relevant data,
                the author reviews the actual art historical evidence for the Church of the East in
                China and Central Asia, contrasting it with the South Asian situation (more
                iconophile for the former, less so for the latter). The chapter concludes with
                eighteen images of Syriac churches, both modern and ancient.</p>
            <p  xml:lang="en">The book concludes with Chapter eleven by <hi rend="bold"
                    >Patrick Taveirne</hi> on the <hi rend="italic">status quaestionis</hi> of
                research on the aforementioned “Nestorian” bronze crosses. The author begins with a
                discussion of the mysterious nature of these items, noting that “almost nothing is
                known about their exact date and place of origin, function, typology and symbolic
                meaning” (p. 213). Indeed, the thorough and helpful overview of scholarship on them
                clearly shows the lack of any consensus on what they are, where they originate, how
                they were used or indeed who used them. Individual features of the bronzes noted in
                the chapter include the <hi rend="italic">svastika</hi>, bird images and Turkic <hi
                    rend="italic">tamghas</hi> (identifying marks used by Eurasian steppe nomads).
                This is followed by a consideration of the “growing doubts and debate on the concept
                of Nestorian crosses,” in which the Ordos crosses are compared with Bronze Age stamp
                seals from Iran and Central Asia, with generic Yuan seals and with Bronze Age items
                from Armenia.</p>
            <p  xml:lang="en">Given their similarity with bronzes found elsewhere, many
                scholars have questioned the supposed Christian origin of the Ordos crosses
                (especially in light of the widespread occurrence of cross shapes in pre-historic
                artifacts). The author gives an extensive discussion of the following topics (with
                particular reference to universal archetypal symbols): Eurasian religious
                iconography, the <hi rend="italic">svastika</hi>, the bird images and the cross
                shape (in proto-historic, Manichaean and Christian iterations). The chapter ends
                with a short study on different types of crosses used in the Church of the East and
                the function of the cross in the Asian context of the Church (as cosmic sign, sign
                of the glorified Christ and amulet/charm), finishing with the lotus cross featured
                on the Xi’an Stele. In the end, as the author concludes, “we still lack solid
                archaeological data… and documentary source material [for determining the origin,
                function and meaning of the bronzes]. The archaeological context…is lost indeed” (p.
                229). Five images accompany the chapter.</p>
            <p  xml:lang="en">This volume will be of interest not only to scholars who follow
                the history of the Church of the East in China and Central Asia, but also to those
                who deal with Chinese literature (and art history) from the Tang and Yuan dynasties.
                As is typical of conference proceedings, rather than addressing the overall story of
                Christianity in the regions covered, the articles discussed here are mostly
                snapshots of discrete pieces of evidence, many of which are the basic building
                blocks from which we are able to reconstruct that larger story. Nevertheless, one
                broad (and very pertinent) theme can be observed: the issue of foreignness versus
                indigeneity in the mission of the Church of the East. Indeed, several authors note
                the “foreign” aspect of the Church of the East’s sojourn in China, from the Syriac
                and Sogdian biblical and liturgical texts discussed by Hunter and Sims-Williams to
                the Syriac text on the Xi’an Stele highlighted by Lieu and the overall notion of
                foreignness that features in Thompson’s title, not to mention the many Syriac words
                and phrases from Tang and Yuan dynasty Christian texts and inscriptions that are
                catalogued by Takahashi. </p>
            <p  xml:lang="en">In contrast, other authors (notably Chen, Deeg and Taveirne)
                focus their primary attention on the need to interpret either the Jingjiao texts or
                the Ordos bronzes within their Chinese (or broader Eurasian) context, paying close
                attention to how the texts and artifacts reflect and are influenced by the social,
                political and religious milieu in which they were created. In truth, both viewpoints
                are valid and need to be affirmed when considering missionary religions like
                Christianity, which has persistently grappled with how to remain faithful to its
                core tenets while adapting its message to the changing cultural contexts it finds
                itself in. The Church of the East, spread out along the Silk Road network from the
                Middle East to China, arguably exemplifies this dynamic tension between tradition
                and adaptation as well as any church has thus far.</p>
            <p  xml:lang="en">There are a few minor issues with the volume. One concerns the
                use of the adjective “Nestorian” without quotation marks (and apart from
                understandable references to its use in earlier publications) in several chapters.
                Although this was common usage in the past, one need only read Sebastian Brock’s
                “The ‘Nestorian’ Church: a Lamentable Misnomer” to realize that there is no longer
                justification for using this problematic term (with all its dismissive connotations
                of heresy and “otherness”). It would have been helpful to have had this clarified
                somewhere in the book’s forematter; although it is addressed briefly by Chen (p. 93,
                n. 1), Thompson (pp. 146–47) and Taveirne (p. 213, n. 2), nowhere is there a
                prominent explanation of why this term (convenient though it may be) is so unhelpful
                in describing the Church of the East.</p>
            <p  xml:lang="en">Another possible oversight is the relatively few reference to
                the Christian texts found at Turfan, outside of the first two chapters by Hunter and
                Sims-Williams. For instance, one would have thought that Takahashi’s chapter, with
                its inclusion of areas peripheral to China proper (e.g., Dunhuang), would have
                included more data from Turfan than that which is referenced in footnotes (although
                it was likely for reasons of space that such data was not included). Parry’s chapter
                on images could also have benefited from bringing Turfan into the equation; the wall
                paintings from the church in Qocho (in the Turfan oasis), about which the author has
                written elsewhere, would have helped strengthen his argument even more. On the topic
                of Turfan, Chen’s statement that “few of these [Turfan] texts consisted of direct
                translations from the Bible” (p. 94) is unclear. It is true that most of the
                biblical texts (whether in Syriac, Sogdian, Middle Persian or New Persian)
                discovered at Turfan are contained in Psalters and lectionaries, but their
                appearance in books specifically designed for liturgical use does not make them any
                less “translations” than if they were complete texts of the New Testament or Old
                Testament.</p>
            <p  xml:lang="en">I found the main arguments in several of the chapters hard to
                follow; this was particularly true for Chen’s chapter (the conclusion of which was
                not particularly strong), some aspects of Deeg’s chapter (which will be a challenge
                for those not trained in the Chinese language), and Taveirne’s chapter (which covers
                so much ground that it can be difficult to remember what the main points are). It is
                perhaps not a coincidence that these three chapters were the most “theory-heavy” in
                the whole volume, requiring more intense concentration on the part of the reader
                than the chapters that are more “data-driven.”</p>
            <p  xml:lang="en">Niu Ruji’s chapter was particularly problematic for me,
                beginning with an overly simplistic and reductionist summary of how the “Nestorian”
                Church got its name (p. 177). Several statements also seem questionable to me,
                including “Jing [<hi style="font-family:SimSun">景</hi>, as in “Jingjiao”] might be a
                phonetic imitation of Jesus” (p. 177: I am not aware of any other scholar who has
                made such a suggestion) and “with the circle symbolizing heaven and the cross
                symbolizing earth” (p. 180) in reference to the Ordos bronze crosses, again an idea
                I have not run across elsewhere; this latter view is offered with no reference to
                sources (indeed, the whole chapter is rather thin on footnotes). The author’s
                translation of <hi rend="italic">ärkägün-ning xadunï marda tärim</hi> as “wife of a
                Nestorian, Princess Martha” (p. 177) is also problematic, as the Turkic word <hi
                    rend="italic">ärkägün</hi> (“Yelikewen” in Chinese) merely means “Christian”
                during the Mongol era (“Nestorian” is not part of the essential meaning here); its
                general use also rules out the author’s interpretation of it as a reference to
                “archpriest,” a term not found in the ecclesiastical hierarchy of the Church of the
                East (in contrast to, e.g., “archdeacon,” which occurs frequently in Central Asian
                Syriac script gravestones).</p>
            <p  xml:lang="en">Finally, a few miscellaneous points I encountered in the
                volume. In Lieu’s chapter, <foreign xml:lang="syr">ܨܝܢܣܬܐܢ</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="syr">ܒܬ ܨܝܢܝܐ</foreign> are transliterated as <hi
                    rend="italic">zynstʾn</hi> and <hi rend="italic">bt zynyʾ</hi> respectively,
                instead of <hi rend="italic">ṣynstʾn</hi> and <hi rend="italic">bt ṣynyʾ</hi> (p.
                131); in fact, given that the monks associated with the mission to China were
                Persian or Sogdian speakers, the first term, an Iranian word, would have been
                pronounced as <hi rend="italic">čynstʾn</hi> (when used to transliterate Iranian
                languages, ܨ represents the sound /č/). Thompson’s chapter is laudable in its
                efforts to integrate insights from the field of religious studies, but it might have
                been helped by more references to the role that imperialism and colonialism played
                in 19th-century scholarship on early Syriac Christianity (pp. 150–54). Finally, I
                would have liked more source details on the duplication of metropolitan province
                names mentioned in Wilmshurst’s chapter (p. 168); there is indeed a reference to the
                author’s book <hi rend="italic">Martyred Church</hi>, but the latter sadly includes
                no footnotes.</p>
            <p  xml:lang="en">Having said all that, I nonetheless heartily recommend this
                volume for anyone who is interested in interactions between Syriac Christianity and
                the cultures of Central and East Asia.</p>

         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P1"/>[1] Iraqi
    Christian visitors or immigrants in the West are often
    surprised by the question “When did you convert to
    Christianity?” Their indignant response is usually
    “We have always been Christian!” Indeed,
    Christianity had arrived in Iraq before it arrived in Britain
    or anywhere in northern Europe. Today the number of Christians
    in Iraq surpasses half a million (573,918 according to the 1997
    edition of <hi rend="italic">World Church Handbook</hi>, quoted in the book
    under review on p. 181).</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P2"/>[2] The
    author, Suha Rassam is a Catholic of the Chaldean rite, born in
    Mosul. A medical doctor, she had been an Assistant Professor of
    Medicine in the University of Baghdad. After coming to England
    in 1990 she worked in London hospitals until her retirement
    when she took an MA in Eastern Christianity at the school of
    Oriental and African Studies in the University of London. In
    this she is following in the footsteps of her distinguished
    ancestors. During the heyday of medieaval Arab civilization
    many famous Christian physicians had written works about
    history and theology, or conversely, many theologians had
    produced works about medicine. But, as far as I know, Rassam is
    the first woman to combine the two disciplines.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P3"/>[3] Her book
    presents a history of Christianity in Iraq from the very
    beginnings until our own time. (The last date in the chronology
    is 10 April 2005, recording the appointment of Mr.
    Jaʿfari as Prime Minister). According to
    tradition Christianity was first preached in Iraq by the
    Apostle Thomas on his way to India and his fellow-Apostle, St.
    Thaddeus. Or maybe even earlier? In his Prologue to the book
    Monsignor Mikhael Al Jamil mentions the three Magi who had
    visited the Infant Jesus in Bethlehem. Could they have been
    Iraqis? The Magi were Zoroastrian priests, presumably ethnic
    Persians, but Iraq was at that time part of the Iranian
    (Parthian) Empire. Could they have brought back the news of the
    Saviour, Saoshyant foretold by Zarathushtra?</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P4"/>[4] The
    Parthian Arsacid rulers of Iran and Iraq, nominal Zoroastrians
    were quite tolerant of other religions. The situation changed
    in 224 AD when they were overthrown by the Sassanids, ardent
    Persian nationalists, determined to restore the ancient culture
    of Iran without the foreign influences accumulated since the
    conquest by Alexander 500 years before. Christianity, as a
    foreign religion, was perceived as a threat, especially during
    the constant wars between Zoroastrian Iran and Christian
    Byzantium. The harshest and longest persecution in the history
    of Iraqi/Iranian Christianity took place during the forty years
    (339-379) reign of Shah Shapur II. The Chaldean church in
    Montreal is dedicated to its numerous victims, <hi rend="italic">Les Saints
    Martyrs d’Orient</hi>. The situation improved when the
    Church of the East declared itself independent of Byzantium and
    Rome (like in our times the Chinese Catholic Patriotic
    Association in Communist China).</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P5"/>[5] During
    the 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> and 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi> century Middle Eastern
    Christianity gradually divided itself into three mutually
    hostile groups, accusing each other of heresy. Ostensibly the
    conflict was over a formula expressing the human and divine
    nature of Christ, but cultural differences played their part.
    The so-called Melkites or “Royalists” (from Syriac
    <hi rend="italic">malkâ</hi>, Arabic <hi rend="italic">malik</hi>,
    “king”) accepted the doctrine promoted by the
    Byzantine Emperor (and the Pope), as defined by the Council of
    Chalcedon. The West Syrian or Syrian Orthodox Church (better
    known as Jacobite after its famous preacher Jacob Baradeus) was
    accused of denying Christ’s true humanity. Finally the
    East Syrian Church or Church of the East, best known as
    Nestorian for accepting the doctrine preached by Nestorius,
    Patriarch of Constantinople, condemned by the Council of
    Ephesus, refused to accept the term <hi rend="italic">Theotokos</hi> (Mother
    of God), insisting that Mary was the Mother of Jesus the Man
    only.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P6"/>[6] Rassam
    takes us through all those controversies showing us that most
    of them were simply misunderstandings. The disputants had been
    trying to apply Greek logic to issues which belonged to faith
    more than to philosophy. Indeed, in 1994 the
    “Nestorian” Church of the East and the Catholic
    Church have issued a joint statement expressing their agreement
    about the two natures and one Person of Christ. Better late
    than never!</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P7"/>[7] But to
    the majority of the faithful (of any denomination) more
    relevant than abstract questions of theology are such
    discernible signs as the liturgical language, Communion under
    both species or in the form of bread only, the direction of the
    sign of the Cross, left or right, married clergy versus
    celibate clergy (or bearded clergy versus clean-shaven clergy),
    Gregorian versus Julian calendar, baptism by sprinkling with
    water or by immersion, the mystery of the Mass behind a screen
    or curtain or openly facing the congregation, segregated or
    merged seating of men and women in church, the presence or
    absence of icons... (The Church of the East rejects any
    pictorial representations as staunchly as Islam or some radical
    Protestant Churches in the West). Rassam has little to tell us
    about those relatively trivial (or perhaps not so trivial)
    matters.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P8"/>[8] She
    strongly objects to the use of the terms
    “Nestorian” and “Jacobite”
    traditionally applied to the Church of the East and the Syrian
    Orthodox Church by outsiders as incorrect and even offensive.
    Nestorius was not even a member of the Church which goes by his
    name! Likewise she proposes the term “Oriental Orthodox
    Churches” for the so-called “Monophysite”
    Churches (another incorrect term thrust upon them by their
    opponents) which include the Syrian Orthodox Church and its
    sister Churches in the Middle East to distinguish them from the
    Chalcedonian “Eastern Orthodox Churches” of Eastern
    Europe which follow the Byzantine tradition (p. 63). This may
    work very well in English which provides us with the synonyms
    “Eastern” and “Oriental”, but what
    about other languages? In French we can say <hi rend="italic">Les Eglises
    Orthodoxes Orientales</hi>, but what alternative do we
    have?</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P9"/>[9] Yet the
    term “Nestorian”, while incorrect, does have an
    illustrious history. Most of us have heard of the
    “lost” Nestorian Christianities in the heart of
    Asia. Persecuted or harassed in the Iranian Empire the Church
    of the East had sent missionaries to India, to Central Asia and
    China. Today some 20 million Christians in the Indian State of
    Kerala use Syriac as their liturgical language. Nestorian
    Christianity has disappeared from Central Asia and China by the
    14<hi rend="sup">th</hi> century, but some of its traces remain: The
    Mongolian language is still written in a Syriac-derived script
    in Inner (Chinese) Mongolia, as it was written in Outer
    (independent) Mongolia until the introduction of Cyrillic in
    1941.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P10"/>[10] The
    Arab Muslim conquerors were welcomed by the Iraqi Christians as
    liberators from the oppressive Iranian rule. Under
    <hi rend="italic">shari<hi rend="sup">c</hi>a</hi> law Christians, Jews and
    Sabi’ans, followers of monotheistic religions mentioned
    in the Koran, were given certain rights as <hi rend="italic">dhimmis</hi>
    (“protected persons”). Under the ‘Abbasid
    Caliphs, when Arab Islamic civilization had reached its apogee
    Christians became particularly appreciated as translators of
    Greek philosophy into Arabic and as physicians. Suha Rassam
    quotes a story by Jâhiz about a medical doctor Asad bin
    Jani who complains that he has no patients because he is a
    Muslim, not a Christian (p. 83). Sounds eerily familiar: In
    pre-War Poland Jewish doctors were perceived as more competent
    than their Polish Catholic colleagues. The joke went that every
    anti-Semite made an exception for his doctor. Understandably
    Christian success had created resentment. Even such leading
    intellectuals like Jâhiz and Tabari found it necessary to
    write anti-Christian polemics.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P11"/>[11] At
    the time of the Arab conquest the overwhelming majority of
    Iraqi Christians spoke Syriac. Gradually they began to change
    their language from Syriac to Arabic although they continued to
    attend Syriac churches. Today Syriac-speakers are a minority,
    even among the Christians of Iraq. Rassam’s Mosul family
    had always been Arabic-speaking, at least as far as her
    great-grandmother could remember. Our author speculates that
    she may be descended not from Chaldeans who had lost their
    language, but from Arabs who had converted to Christianity
    before Islam (p. 128, n. 6). She does not mention any
    Kurdish-speaking Christians.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P12"/>[12] The
    Mongol conquest of Baghdad in 1258 was of course a catastrophe
    for the Arabs, but, paradoxically enough it put Christians in a
    position of advantage compared to the preceding period. For all
    their barbarity the Mongol rulers had one great virtue:
    complete religious tolerance. Indeed many of them were members
    of the Church of the East. <hi rend="italic">Jizyah</hi>, the special tax
    which the <hi rend="italic">dhimmis</hi> had to pay in lieu of military
    service and all other legal disadvantages affecting Christians
    were abolished. The year 1287 saw the first attempt at
    reconciliation between the Church of the East and the Catholic
    Church. The Patriarch Yahballaha III sent his Bishop, Bar Sauma
    to Rome with letters from the pro-Christian <hi rend="italic">ilkhan</hi> of
    Iran, Argun Khan proposing a Mongol-Christian alliance. Perhaps
    fortunately no military alliance materialized, but Bar Sauma
    was warmly received by the Pope and allowed to participate in
    all church ceremonies like a Catholic Bishop in good standing.
    The Christian-Mongol “honeymoon” ended in 1295 when
    Argun’s son and successor, Ghazan converted to Islam. The
    <hi rend="italic">shari<hi rend="sup">c</hi>a</hi> was reinstated, including all
    restrictions on the <hi rend="italic">dhimmis</hi>.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P13"/>[13] Iraq
    was conquered by the Ottoman Turks in 1534. The Ottomans
    governed their recognised non-Muslim minorities through the
    <hi rend="italic">millet</hi> system. <hi rend="italic">Millet</hi>, derived from Arabic
    <hi rend="italic">milla</hi> (“sect”) means “nation”
    in Turkish. Each “nation” was given a large measure
    of inner self-government with the Patriarch or leader holding
    civil as well as ecclesiastical authority with the
    responsibility of collecting taxes for the Ottoman
    Government.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P14"/>[14] The
    origins of the Chaldean “Uniate” Catholic Church
    can be traced to 1552 when a rival Patriarch of the Church of
    the East, John Sulaqa asked for and was granted recognition by
    the Pope. The Patriarch Shimʿon VIII
    Dinkha, recognised as head of his <hi rend="italic">millet</hi> had him
    thrown in prison by the Ottoman authorities. The union lasted
    on and off with the two lines of Patriarchs exchanging their
    positions until it became permanent in 1830 when John VIII
    Hormiz was given by the Pope the title “Patriarch of
    Babylon over the Chaldeans”. The Chaldean Catholic
    <hi rend="italic">Millet</hi> was recognised by the Ottoman authorities in
    1844. Today the Chaldean Catholic Church forms the largest
    Christian community in Iraq. The Iraqi Christians are perfectly
    justified in their proud boast “We have always been
    Christian”, but they stand on less firm ground when they
    claim “We have always been Catholic”.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P15"/>[15]
    Meanwhile the Church of the East, much reduced in numbers found
    refuge in the almost inaccessible Hakkâri Mountains in
    southeast Turkey. Its faithful, claiming descent from the
    ancient Assyrians displayed the war-like qualities of their
    ancestors. No Ottoman military or tax collector dared enter
    their territory. The chiefs of their seven tribes bore the
    grandiose title <hi rend="italic">Malik</hi> (“King” in Arabic).
    Over the seven Kings stood the Patriarch of the East whose
    office had become hereditary from uncle to nephew in the Mar
    Shimʿun family. Their virtually independent
    state bore a remarkable resemblance to Montenegro, unconquered
    by the Turks and likewise ruled by hereditary (uncle to nephew)
    Orthodox Bishops.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P16"/>[16]
    During the First World War, the Assyrians, encouraged by
    Russian and British agents, openly rebelled against their
    nominal Turkish overlords. Driven out of Turkey into Iran whose
    declared neutrality was respected by neither party they
    captured the largely Assyrian city of Urmiyé. They held
    their own against Turkish, Iranian and Kurdish attacks until
    August 1918 when they decided to trek south to British-occupied
    Hamadan. Some fifteen out of sixty thousand perished on the
    way. The British, who had by that time occupied most of Iraq,
    removed them to Baʿqubah where they trained
    the wild mountain guerrillas into a modern army. The so-called
    Assyrian Levies ranked among the toughest soldiers in the
    British Empire, equal to Sikhs and Gurkhas. Their loyalty to
    their British allies would cost them dearly.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P17"/>[17] By
    1920 the British liberators of Iraq had outstayed their welcome
    and an uprising broke out in the South. It was put down,
    largely with Assyrian help, but the British were forced to
    grant self-government to Iraq with Faysal I as King. Formal
    independence followed in 1932. Rassam greatly admires King
    Faysal for his lack of prejudice against religious minorities.
    She quotes him with approval (p. 134): “I do not want to
    hear that this country contains Christians, Jews or Muslims
    because <hi rend="italic">we are all Semites</hi> [emphasis added by the
    reviewer] forming one nation called Iraq...” True, the
    Chaldeans, the Assyrians, the Jews and the Arabs are Semites,
    but the Kurds are not. Rassam does not comment.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P18"/>[18] With
    Iraqi independence the British disbanded the Assyrian Levies,
    hated by the Arab Muslim population. Fearing the worst, the
    Assyrians refused to surrender their arms. A clash with the
    Iraqi Army became inevitable. King Faysal, very ill, tried to
    avert the tragedy, but was ignored by his Prime Minister,
    Rashid Ali al-Gaylani, a Fascist who would stage a pro-German
    coup d’état during the 2<hi rend="sup">nd</hi> World War.
    Meanwhile his government created a general panic by
    exaggerating reports about the strength of the Assyrian rebel
    forces and the danger they represented. Unable to hold their
    own against the Iraqi Army the Assyrians were massacred in the
    summer of 1933. King Faysal died soon afterwards. The Patriarch
    of the East, Mar Eshai Shimʿun was expelled
    from the country and not allowed back until 1970. Needless to
    say, the Assyrian problem did not make life easier for the
    other Christian communities in Iraq.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P19"/>[19] In
    1958 the Iraqi Monarchy was overthrown and a Republic
    proclaimed. In 1968 power was seized by the
    Baʿath (“Renaissance”) Party,
    an Arab nationalist party founded by a Christian Arab political
    philosopher, Michel Aflaq. Its secular nationalism appealed to
    many young Christian Arab intellectuals. “A sense of
    belonging to the country as an Arab, an Iraqi and a Christian
    was encouraged but only through being a
    Baʿathist” (p. 149). Saddam Hussein
    succeeded Ahmad Hassan al-Bakr as President in 1979. Whatever
    his misdeeds as a ruthless dictator he never perpetrated nor
    permitted any iniquity against the Christians. He appointed
    many Christians to high positions including the Deputy Prime
    Minister, Tariq Aziz. If Christians suffered under his regime,
    it was not specifically as Christians but like all Iraqis.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P20"/>[20] Like
    every historian who has drawn her narrative down to her own
    time, Rassam is forced to make a comment about the current
    situation. She has little sympathy for the American-led
    invasion, as is shown by her use of the term
    “occupation”, a term the self-proclaimed
    “liberators” of Iraq would protest against. She
    quotes with approval the joint statement of the Bishops of
    Mosul of all denominations (p. 190): “...We ask the
    occupying forces and all foreign armed people to leave the
    country.” The “foreign armed people” are
    Muslim volunteers come to Iraq to fight the Americans. They
    have carried out indiscriminate killings, not only of Americans
    and the new Iraqi Army and Police, but of ordinary Iraqis,
    Christians and Muslims. They have carried out bomb attacks
    against Christian churches which have been condemned by all
    Iraqi Muslim religious leaders, Sunni and
    Shiʿa. Since the book was published
    Shiʿa and Sunni mosques have also been
    destroyed by bombs, so that now all Iraqis, Christians and
    Muslims are in the same desperate situation. The last chapter
    “Iraq under occupation and transitional rule” does
    not make happy reading, but the overall message of the book
    need not be pessimistic. Iraqi Christians (and all Iraqis) had
    survived persecution, foreign invasion, civil war in the past
    and this could be the ultimate lesson from history.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P21"/>[21] The
    bibliography consists of two sections: “Publications in
    English” (p. [198]-202) and “Arabic publications
    and translations” (p. 202-3). There are no French works
    listed, not even J.M. Fiey’s monumental <hi rend="italic">Assyrie
    chrétienne</hi>, although Rassam had learnt French in
    L’Ecole de la Présentation, a girls’ school
    in Baghdad directed by French nuns and indeed she mentions Fiey
    in note 32 on p. 75 without giving the title of his book. The
    Arabic titles are given in English translation only, without
    the Arabic original, neither in transliteration nor in the
    original script. Now suppose I want to look up Al-Kaisi, Abd
    al-Majid Hasib, <hi rend="italic">The Political and Military History of the
    Assyrians in Iraq</hi> in a library catalogue? I have to
    translate it back into Arabic <hi rend="italic">Târîkh
    al-Athûrîyîn al-Siyâsî
    wa-al-‘Askarî fî-al-‘Irâq</hi>
    (?) and hope that this is how the title goes in the original,
    but how can I be sure? There are glossaries of Syriac and
    Arabic terms (p. [194]-197), but no index, which would have
    been very useful.</p>
         <p>

    Syriac and Arabic names in the text are spelt phonetically, not
    according to any exact transliteration, as we would expect in a
    book written for the general public. However there are many
    typos, no doubt the fault of the English printer, e.g., the
    name Bakr is spelt Bakir, both in the case of the Caliph Abu
    Bakr (p. 73, n. 18) and of President Ahmad Hassan al-Bakr (p.
    148).</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P23"/>[23] An
    unfortunate slip of the pen occurs on p. 173: In enumerating
    the Chaldean churches outside Iraq the author counts “two
    in Iran”. Maybe she means the two Archdioceses, Tehran
    and Urmiyé. As to parish churches, there are in Sanandaj
    (the former See of the Archbishop of Tehran), in Salmas, in
    Kermanshah, in Hamadan, and in Ahvaz.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P24"/>[24] The
    fourteen pages of black-and-white photographs will give the
    Western reader a direct feeling of Iraqi Christian culture,
    although they do not give full justice to the rich
    ecclesiastical architectural heritage of Iraq.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P25"/>[25] The
    book fills a much needed lacuna. Most educated Westerners have
    heard of the Copts in Egypt, the Maronites in Lebanon, but the
    presence of the Chaldeans and other Christian groups in Iraq is
    largely unknown. Although the book is written with the general
    reader in mind, the Orientalist scholar will find much useful
    information in it. Its scope extends beyond its stated subject
    matter. Iraq is not an island, geographically or figuratively
    speaking, and Iraqi Christianity is placed within a wider
    context. We learn about the history of the Christian Church and
    its Christological controversies of interest to theologians,
    about the history of the Middle East, and of the neighbouring
    countries, Iran, Syria and Turkey. I believe that the history
    of a religious or ethnic minority throws a new perspective on
    our view of the society in general. (“Black
    Studies” teach us something not only about the history of
    Black people in North America, but also about American and
    Canadian history as such). The author’s references to her
    personal experience as an Iraqi Christian add a lot to the
    charm of the book. There are those who believe that a scholarly
    work has to be dry and impersonal, excluding any
    “anecdotal” material to be truly
    “academic”. This reviewer does not share that view
    and would recommend the book to all readers interested in Iraq
    and the Middle East.</p>

                <p xml:lang="en">Although <ref target="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Aramaic">Aramaic</ref> with its history of some three-thousand years can offer many important insights into the long-term workings of language change 
					and the effects of lasting contact, studies that extend beyond one variety or a group of directly related varieties are still extremely rare. 
					This is understandable: no single person can have a complete overview of the huge internal diversity of Aramaic; its study is scattered across 
					several distinct academic disciplines; and much of the material remains inaccessible without a rigorous philological training (in the case of 
					earlier epigraphic witnesses and manuscripts that have not yet been translated) or full immersion into descriptive work (as with the many modern 
					vernaculars). In the book under review, a modified version of the author’s 2008 Harvard dissertation, Na‛ama Pat-El now takes the major step of 
					bringing together evidence from the entire chronological and geographical spectrum in order to trace the evolution of three different syntactic 
					phenomena (with some further comparative remarks), namely, adverbial subordination, nominal modifiers, and direct speech representations.
				</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">A number of preliminary matters, such as the approach and the corpus underlying the ensuing discussion, are briefly outlined in the introduction 
					(pp. 1–19). The author wishes to extend the principles of comparative phonological and morphological reconstruction, which still constitute the backbone of 
					linguistic subgrouping, to syntax, a field usually studied from a synchronic point of view due to its susceptibility to fast and radical change. In pursuing this 
					goal, she collects examples from different Aramaic varieties through the history of the language that illustrate each of the three phenomena under investigation: 
					Old and Official Aramaic, a selection of textual witnesses of the main representatives of the later Western (Jewish Palestinian and Samaritan) as well as of the 
					Eastern branches (Syriac, Jewish Babylonian, Mandaic), and several modern vernaculars. Forms of Aramaic that were less easily accessible by means of 
					<pb n="142"/>complete synchronic descriptions, such as Qumran Aramaic, on which the first full reference grammar appeared only in 2011,
						<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn1" n="1">
							<p rend="footnote text">T. Muraoka, <hi rend="italic">A Grammar of Qumran Aramaic</hi> (Louvain: Peeters, 2011).</p>
						</note>
					or certain epigraphic corpora, by contrast, do not feature prominently in the work under review. The selection of topics receives no further motivation, 
					so it is first and foremost a common approach that unites the three main chapters, not the subject matter itself.
				</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">As the author proceeds “top-down” from an examination of general patterns and structures rather than “bottom-up” from some puzzling and seemingly 
					irregular detail in a specific text that turns out to have a wider bearing on the grammar of the respective language, her work embodies both the 
					opportunities and the limits of largely theory-driven comparative historical syntax as opposed to more strictly evidence-based philology: the 
					broad chronological range brings tendencies to the fore that would go unnoticed in a detailed but more restricted grammatical analysis; yet the 
					linguistic facts often seem to be gleaned “second-hand” from existing grammars (which of course tend to present language as a regular system, if 
					only for pedagogical reasons) or dictionaries and are not collected by way of a meticulous study of the primary sources that aims at a maximum of 
					accuracy in each case, gives full attention to exceptions, and also discusses problems of reading, textual criticism, or transcription. Of course 
					the latter would only be possible on a smaller scale,
						<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn2" n="2"> 
							<p rend="footnote text">An excellent example is Chr. Stadel, “Syntagmen mit nachgestelltem kl im Alt-, Reichs- und Mittelaramäisch,” 
							<hi rend="italic">Journal of Semitic Studies</hi> 56 (2011), 37–70.</p>
						</note>
					but, as will be seen, the primacy of the theory in this book has consequences for several 
					of the views it advocates. Some relevant secondary literature goes unnoticed, too.
				</p>
				<p xml:lang="en">While such limitations in completeness and precision are thus inherent to the author’s extremely wide perspective, one might still have hoped for 
					a somewhat more nuanced and up-to-date discussion of the internal classification of Aramaic instead of the simple but hardly adequate division 
					into chronological “phases” according to Fitzmyer. In addition to that, a lucid and convincing historical framework that can relate Official 
					Aramaic to its roots in the complicated dialect landscape of Babylonia on the one hand and its impact on post-Achaemenid varieties on the other 
					would be able to account more comprehensively for the historical circumstances by <pb n="143"/>which certain innovations could spread in Aramaic.
						<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn3" n="3">
							<p rend="footnote text">For an attempt along these lines, cf. H. Gzella, “Imperial Aramaic,” in: S. Weninger et al., eds., <hi rend="italic">Semitic 
							Languages</hi> (Berlin and New York: De Gruyter, 2011), 574–586, and id., “Late Imperial Aramaic,” ibid., 598–609.</p>
						</note>
					This seems all the more desirable since the author herself repeatedly singles out the role of Official Aramaic as a catalyst for important long-term changes. 
					In view of the very high degree of standardization of Achaemenid Official Aramaic, it is thus simply misguided to regard the documentary texts 
					from Egypt as specimens of “the local dialect” (namely “Egyptian Aramaic”; so explicitly on p. 159), for the papyri from Samaria and the new 
					Aramaic letters on parchment from Bactria (the latter still go unmentioned) evidently reflect the same script and language variety in terms of 
					orthography, morphology, syntax, and lexicon despite occasional variation (caused by incidental phonetic spelling and at times perhaps imperfect 
					learning) on the micro-level.
						<note place="ftn4" n="4">
							<p rend="footnote text">There are numerous studies on the basic linguistic unity of the core of Official Achaemenid Aramaic, see, e.g. 
							(with further bibliography),    H. Gzella, <hi rend="italic">Tempus, Aspekt und Modalität im Reichsaramäischen</hi> 
							(Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz, 2004), 35–48; id., “Das sprachliche Prestige des Reichs-aramäischen,” in: R. Rollinger, B. Gufler, M. Land, and I. Madreiter, 
							eds., <hi rend="italic">Interkulturalität in der Alten Welt</hi> (Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz, 2010), 489–505; the linguistic position of the Samaria 
							Papyri is discussed by id., <hi rend="italic">Bibliotheca Orientalis</hi> 69 (2012), 610–611, the material from Bactria in id., “Local Administration: 
							Bactria,” forthcoming in: B. Jacbos and R. Rollinger, eds., <hi rend="italic">A Companion to the Achaemenid Persian Empire</hi> (Oxford: Wiley-Blackwell, 
							2014). Some scholars who include the Hermopolis Letters in the corpus tend to overstate the internal heterogeneity of Achaemenid Aramaic, but these 
							letters seem to be essentially pre-Achaemenid in their linguistic garb (Gzella, “Imperial Aramaic,” 582–583).</p>
						</note>
					Consequently, the term “Egyptian Aramaic” and its underlying concept cause confusion and should be avoided.
				</p>
				<p xml:lang="en">The first and longest chapter focuses on adverbial subordination (pp. 21–88). As the many specific markers used for introducing dependent 
					clauses often differ so markedly in the historical Semitic languages, the author concludes that they have, by and large, evolved individually from asyndetic 
					relative clauses, with the head noun turning into an adverbial subordinator. This is an appealing explanation; it can contribute to uncovering the 
					driving forces that govern the emergence of similar structures using lexemes without a common etymology in related languages. Aramaic, <pb n="144"/>by contrast, 
					differs from other Semitic idioms in that subordinators seem to be based on the relative particle <hi rend="italic">zy</hi> */ḏī/ (later <hi rend="italic">dy</hi> /dī/) there, while its 
					pre-modern varieties did apparently not develop original subordinators in the way other Semitic languages did but in the course of time even lost 
					the respective inherited forms such as */kī/, and modern dialects borrowed various subordinators from neighboring languages. By stressing this 
					curious dissimilarity, the author points to an important and hitherto underrated feature of Aramaic, even if she may exaggerate her case.
						<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn5" n="5">
							<p rend="footnote text">Cf. the very critical remark by Muraoka, <hi rend="italic">Grammar</hi>, 227 n. 121, who points out that she “is trying to 
							attempt to fit data to the straightjacket of her thesis.”</p>
						</note>
				</p>
				<p xml:lang="en">Internal distinctions between Western and Eastern Aramaic subordinators, however, turn out to be less clear-cut than a somewhat global overview 
					of the relevant forms suggests. It is common knowledge that /meṭṭol/ ‘because of’ belongs to the hallmarks of Eastern Aramaic (pp. 73-77) due to 
					the underlying by-form */ṭoll/ ‘shadow’ instead of etymological and Western Aramaic */ṭell/.

					Yet <hi rend="italic">dlmh</hi> in its function as the subordinator ‘lest’ (instead of the common adverb ‘perhaps’), here presented as a characteristically Eastern trait (pp. 39–46), also occurs in Aramaic texts from 
					Qumran that otherwise contain no single trace of demonstrable Eastern influence:

					the same meaning may apply to <hi rend="italic">dy lmh</hi> in the Targum to Job (11Q10 21,4 = Job 32,13), where it renders Hebrew <hi rend="italic">pn</hi> ‘lest’.

					Since both texts are said to have been included in the corpus under investigation (p. 15), it is not apparent how comprehensively all the sources listed in

							<p rend="footnote text">One may also note that two different sigla that both refer to the Targum of Job, 11Q10 and 11QtgJob, appear as different texts in

						</note>
					So even though the author’s attempt to introduce largely (but not exclusively) neglected syntactic considerations into the internal classification of Aramaic 
					remains entirely legitimate, the restricted data that are adduced in support of her argument may at times need closer scrutiny.
				</p>
				<p xml:lang="en">Subsequently, the author’s attention moves to nominal modifiers, in particular the position of demonstratives in the clause (pp. 89–145). She 
					suggests that the weakening of the emphatic state as a definiteness marker and the increasing use of proleptic suffixes (e.g., <hi rend="italic">brh zy</hi> PN ‘his son, 
					the one of PN’ = ‘PN’s son’) for indicating nominal individuation eventually triggered the rise of regular pre-positive demonstrative pronouns in 
					the whole of later Aramaic (Samaritan, Mandaic, Jewish Babylonian, Classical Syriac, and Neo-Aramaic) instead of post-positive ones, which were 
					dominant in earlier stages. It is no doubt attractive to connect the gradual spread of prolepsis in Aramaic with wider-ranging changes in 
					constituent order, and the author deserves credit for making this point.
				</p>
				<p xml:lang="en">More specifically, however, she maintains that “the demon-strative consistently precedes the head noun” in non-translated Classical Syriac 
					(p. 102), as opposed to a less easily classified con-stituent order (or even purely stylistic variation) according to the usual grammars, 
					except when then noun “is the antecedent of a relative clause, or when the noun is modified by any other type of attribute” (p. 133). This claim 
					would have to be tested against a much larger textual basis than the relatively small selection of Syr-iac literature mentioned on p. 15, but even 
					a very quick glance at the likewise non-translated <hi rend="italic">Doctrina Addai</hi>, a narrative prose account which (in Cureton’s edition) is said to have been 
					included in the author’s examination as well, reveals numerous counter examples:
						<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn11" n="11">
							<p rend="footnote text">All citations refer to G. Howard, <hi rend="italic">The Teaching of Addai</hi> (Chico, CA: Scholars Press, 1981).</p>
						</note>
					the very same expression ‘at that time’ occurs with both pre-positive (<hi rend="italic">bhw ‘dn’</hi>; p. 48, l. 7) and post-positive (<hi rend="italic">b‘dn’ hw</hi>;  p. 26, l. 5 from below) 
					demonstrative, but in neither case is the noun the antecedent of a relative clause or is further modified, so this must be an instance of free variation. 
					Adverbial expressions of place also tend to take a post-positive demonstrative, even if no<pb n="146"/> additional modification depends on them, and they are hardly all 
					fossilized: <hi rend="italic">b’tr’ hn’</hi> ‘in this place’ (p. 24, l. 17; p. 28, l. 1), <hi rend="italic">bqbr’ hn’</hi> ‘in this tomb’ (p. 24, l. 18), <hi rend="italic">krk’ hn’</hi> ‘this city’ (p. 52, l. 10; p. 68, l. 3); 
					<hi rend="italic">b‘lm’ hn’</hi> ‘in this world’   (p. 96, l. 14);
						<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn12" n="12">
							<p rend="footnote text">The text in Howard reads <hi rend="italic">m‘lm’</hi>, but that must be a typo.</p>
						</note>
					the same goes for subjects of verbal clauses: <hi rend="italic">sw‘rn’ hn’</hi> ‘this event’ (p. 32, l. 18); and other complements: <hi rend="italic">d‘lm’ hn’</hi>
					‘of this world’ (p. 72, l. 5); <hi rend="italic">lhymnwt’ hd’</hi> ‘to this faith’ (p. 90, l. 3 from below; same order as in an almost identical noun phrase with a 
					dependent relative clause on p. 92, l. 17); <hi rend="italic">mn ‘lm’ hn’</hi> ‘from this world’ (p. 96, l. 3 and l. 3 from below); <hi rend="italic">yrtwt’ hd’</hi> ‘this inheritance’ 
					(direct object; p. 96, l. 5).
				</p>
				<p xml:lang="en">Conversely, nouns that act as antecedents of relative clauses likewise occur with pre-positive demonstratives: <hi rend="italic">hlyn tltyhyn dṣby’ mlkwtky dtḥzyn</hi> 
					‘these three things which your majesty desires to see’ (p. 22, l. 14–15); <hi rend="italic">hn’ nbw</hi> […] <hi rend="italic">dsgdyn ’ntwn</hi> ‘this […] Nebo whom you worship’ (p. 48, l. 15); 
					<hi rend="italic">hn’ dyn mlk’ dyln</hi> ‘this king of ours, however’ (p. 90, l. 5); similarly, nouns with other attributes: <hi rend="italic">bhn’ šm’ mšbḥ’</hi> ‘by this glorious name’ 
					(p. 40, l. 5 from below). No doubt many more examples could be found, and it seems that the alleged rule proposed by the author does not exist. 
					Whether there is indeed a general (though perhaps only slight) tendency of the position of demonstratives to be governed by the syntactic context 
					in <ref target=" https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Syriac-Language">Syriac</ref> as such, can only be established by an extensive and sophisticated statistical analysis on the basis of a large corpus. <hi rend="italic">Mutatis 
					mutandis</hi>, this also applies to Mandaic, where the position of the demonstrative pronoun has been described as similarly unstable in standard 
					grammars,

							<p rend="footnote text">Th. Nöldeke, <hi rend="italic">Mandäische Grammatik</hi> (Halle: Buchhandlung des Waisenhauses, 1875), 338.</p>
						</note>
					without there being evidence to the contrary. For the time being, the linguistic facts, upon closer look, do not support the author’s general hypothesis.
				</p>
				<p xml:lang="en">Furthermore, if it is true that “prolepsis was the catalyst for the word order change, as the definite article was weakening and prolepsis has 
					become the common way to mark definiteness” (p. 132), it should be explained why Samaritan Aramaic also participates in this allegedly universal 
					tendency in Aramaic. For Samaritan Aramaic does exhibit frequent pre-positive demonstratives (as noted on p. 100 and 104), but it still has 
					productive definiteness marking,<pb n="147"/> and, unlike the later Eastern dialects, the “emphatic state” had not yet lost its function.
					<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn14" n="14">
							<p rend="footnote text">See now Chr. Stadel, <hi rend="italic">The Morphosyntax of Samaritan Aramaic</hi> (Jerusalem: Bialik, 2013), 65–75 [Hebrew]; 
						Cf. R. Macuch, <hi rend="italic">Grammatik des samaritanischen Aramäisch</hi> (Berlin and New York: De Gruyter, 1982), 285–291.</p>
					</note>
				</p>
				<p xml:lang="en">One may thus entertain the possibility that the emergence of proleptic suffixes some time after the Old Aramaic period did not effectuate these 
					changes in constituent order, but, on the contrary, that they arose as a response to differences in word order that were themselves the result 
					of interference with Akkadian and Old Persian.
						<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn15" n="15">
							<p rend="footnote text">For some possible examples, cf. S. A. Kaufman, <hi rend="italic">The Akkadian Influences on Aramaic</hi> (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1974), 133.</p>
						</note>
					Both languages diverge from Old Aramaic in this respect, and word order is known to be easily susceptible to contact-induced changes. The appearance of 
					proleptic suffixes between the end of the sixth and the beginning of the fifth century B.C. and their subsequent spread would thus coincide nicely with 
					enduring periods of first Aramaic-Akkadian, then Aramaic-Iranian contact.
				</p>
				<p xml:lang="en">Another chapter addresses three different strategies of representing direct speech, i.e., unmarked as an independent sentence after a verb of 
					saying, marked by a language-specific quotative such as <hi rend="italic">l’mr</hi> or <hi rend="italic">lm(’ )mr</hi> ‘saying’ in Aramaic, or (apparently an Aramaic innovation) as a dependent clause 
					introduced by the subordinator <hi rend="italic">(k)zy</hi> / <hi rend="italic">(k)dy</hi>, related to the relative particle (pp. 147–191). While this is all quite well known and duly noted by grammars,

					Instead of the customary, and indeed entirely satisfactory, analysis as a grammaticalized by-form of the older G-stem infinitive without the /m-/ prefix 
					that was already generalized in the Old Aramaic period, she views this as “a calque, borrowed most probably from Egyptian” and even using a form that “is 
					morphologically similar to the Egyptian <hi rend="italic">(r-)ḏd</hi>” (p. 163).
				</p>
				<p xml:lang="en">
                    <pb n="148"/>There are several problems with such a complicated assumption: first, it operates with an instance of otherwise unattested syntactic influence 
					of Egyptian on Aramaic as the Achaemenid chancellery language on top of the known lexical loans; second, if this were but a local dialectal feature (p. 159: 
					“the examples in Egyptian Aramaic are all from texts written in the local dialect”), it would also affect the occurrences at Saqqāra, some 700 kilometers to the 
					north of Elephantine, which is difficult to fathom; third, and most importantly, it requires that the apparently identical usages of <hi rend="italic">l’mr</hi> in the Assur Ostracon, 
					which was originally written in Babylonia, should be interpreted differently, namely as non-lexicalized infinitives. Especially the latter is particularly 
					unlikely, as the genuine infinitive of the root <hi rend="italic">’mr</hi> would presumably already have been <hi rend="italic">m’mr</hi> at that period (as in Aḥiqar 115). Since a possible isogloss between 
					the Assur Ostracon and Official Aramaic can be easily accounted for in light of several other features that point to the latter’s Babylonian roots (of which the 
					author is apparently unaware),
						<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn17" n="17">
							<p rend="footnote text">For an extensive discussion, see Gzella, “Heritage,” 97–98 (cf. also Stadel, “Syntagmen,” 68). There is no indication whatsoever 
							that the Assur Ostracon should be “Eastern Aramaic,” as the author maintains on p. 159 (yet without further proof or specific references), and the 
							connection between this text and later Achaemenid Official Aramaic documents from Egypt becomes only “problematic” (ibid.) if one ignores the Babylonian 
							origin of Achaemenid Aramaic.</p>
						</note>
					it seems unnecessary to replace a perfectly logical explanation by one that needs very considerable special pleading and thus practice <hi rend="italic">clarum per obscurius</hi>. 
					The absence of further examples from outside Egypt may simply be related to the distribution of the material, and even one additional instance from another 
					province of the Achaemenid Empire could finally disprove this theory.
				</p>
				<p xml:lang="en">Similar difficulties arise in the author’s discussion of <hi rend="italic">lm</hi>, which, in her view, does not act as a quotative marker (albeit an optional one) as 
					maintained by traditional scholarship but as an adverb that is merely “associated with a high level of trust in the content of the speech” (p. 190) and is 
					arguably to be derived from a combination of asseverative */la-/ and enclitic /-m/ (p. 187). Such a claim, interesting though it sounds, should, again, be 
					verified on the basis of a comprehensive and meticulous analysis of all relevant occurrences which carefully distinguishes not only between place and time, 
					but also between the context, frequency, and register of the <pb n="149"/>various usages. A cursory discussion of a few selected examples, by contrast, does not permit 
					far-reaching conclusions as to the respective distributional patterns. Moreover, one may note that the Official Aramaic texts from Achaemenid Bactria also 
					contain four instances of <hi rend="italic">lm</hi>, all of them clearly in contexts introducing direct speech.

						</note>
					This adds further support to the widespread conviction that the quotative use was the normal one in Official Aramaic, while the broader functional range in 
					Syriac, where the same particle often introduces scriptural references adduced in support of a writer’s argument, may well be a secondary development.
				</p>
				<p xml:lang="en">The discussion of the purported etymology of <hi rend="italic">lm</hi>, which also bears on the author’s analysis as a basically asseverative adverb, depends on 
					two “sporadic examples in Aramaic” of the alleged enclitic /-m/ (p. 187; cf. p. 80), but these turn out to be less con-vincing in light of a more thorough 
					study of Aramaic philology: the by-form <hi rend="italic">’rwm</hi> of the presentative particle <hi rend="italic">’rw</hi> and the variant <hi rend="italic">’wym</hi> of the exclamation <hi rend="italic">’wy</hi> in Palestinian Aramaic could be 
					connected with the very frequent tendency in Official and post-Official Aramaic to expand all kinds of words and forms ending in stressed long vowels by /-n/ on 
					the one hand and the likewise frequent oscillation between /-n/ and /-m/ specifically in Palestinian Aramaic on the other.

							by M. Sokoloff, <hi rend="italic">A Dictionary of Jewish Palestinian Aramaic</hi> (Ramat-Gan: Bar-Ilan University Press, 2nd ed. 2002), svv. (38 and 73),

					If this is true, they are late by-forms resulting from the same well-attested phonological development and not surprising late reapperances of a pristine 
					feature otherwise unknown in Aramaic (the one possible exception in the bilingual Gozan inscription, KAI 309:11, can be explained as inference from Akkadian). 
					Alternatively, they could also be explained as instances of the affix /-ām/ plus adverbial /-ā/, a category now better attested thanks to the new texts from 
					Bactria (Naveh and Shaked, <hi rend="italic">Documents</hi>, 115; cf. Beyer, <hi rend="italic">Texte</hi> 1, 607). Either explanation is more plausible than the elusive enclitic /-m/ which remains yet 
					unattested in Aramaic.

                    <pb n="150"/>In addition, there are a few minor quibbles on some details that do not affect the author’s overall line of reasoning but should be addressed 
				nonetheless:
				</p>
				<p xml:lang="en">- p. 147, n. 2: the author makes a curiously harsh remark on recent attempts to uncover the workings of evidentiality, which she views as an 
					“exotic category” that has “unfortunately” been applied to Semitic, whereas, in her opinion, “there is no evidence that evidentiality is a category in Semitic”. 
					However, even if unambiguous morphological marking of this notion can be demonstrated to be absent in Semitic (although there is good evidence for grammatical 
					encoding of evidentiality, such as the perfect in NENA dialects), evidentiality in linguistics usually refers to a concept that can surface in various 
					grammatical and / or lexical shapes. If it intersects with the epistemic-modal domain, as many linguists suppose, it should be directly connected with the 
					tense-aspect-modality matrix that of course constitutes a core part of language.
						<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn20" n="20">
							<p rend="footnote text">For a more nuanced account, see H. Gzella, “Some Remarks on Interactions between Aspect, Modality, and Evidentiality,” 
							<hi rend="italic">Folia Orientalia</hi> 49 (2012), 225–232, with further bibliography.</p>
						</note>
					There is nothing “exotic” about it; quite on the contrary, the existence of distinct morphological categories for certain semantic or pragmatic phenomena in 
					less familiar idioms often reveals the existence of similar concepts in better known ones, even if no comparable marking strategy exists.
				</p>
				<p xml:lang="en">- p. 160: the claim that “contracts […] generally contain a more colloquial language” remains unsubstantiated and is at odds with the highly 
					formal spelling of Aramaic legal texts and with the conservative nature of legalese in general.
				</p>
				<p xml:lang="en">- p. 166, n. 43, and p. 172: the idea that <hi rend="italic">š</hi> introducing direct speech in the Hebrew Bar Kosiba letters reflects Aramaic influence could be 
					reinforced by references to earlier scholarly literature where this point has already been discussed at greater length.

                    <pb n="151"/>- p. 168: the alleged distinction between direct and indirect speech in the two examples is not obvious; why should the second one be classified 
					as indirect?
				</p>
				<p xml:lang="en">- p. 185: one is surprised by the author’s unsubstantiated comment that “the Aramaic-speaking colony there [in Elephantine, HGz] could not have 
					been established earlier than” the Persian conquest of Egypt in 525 B.C. There is both an extensive discussion on the controversial origins of Elephantine in the 
					secondary literature and explicit evidence in the Aramaic documents from Elephantine themselves, especially the forceful assertion in one of the most famous 
					letters that the local Judaean Temple antedates the arrival of Cambyses in Egypt (Cowley 30,13 = TAD A4.7,13 par. Cowley 31,12–13 = TAD 4.8,12–13). Given the 
					rapid spread of Aramaic in Palestine even before the Achaemenid period, it is not at all unlikely that Aramaic speakers from Judaea came to Egypt during the 
					first half of the sixth century B.C. or earlier.

				<p xml:lang="en">In this reviewer’s opinion, the principal contribution of the present work is on the level of method: the functional description of 
					individual phenomena generally appears to be somewhat cursory, and not all major conclusions can stand a closer philological examination of 
					the data on which they are based. The broad scope, after all, does not always allow for an equal familiarity with the primary sources, a 
					comprehensive grasp of the grammatical intricacies of the various Aramaic languages covered, or their exact historical connections. However, 
					especially thanks to the conscious use of established linguistic terminology, consistent glossing of examples, and clear sign-posting together 
					with preliminary conclusions throughout, the book helps position Aramaic syntax in more general linguistic debates, makes data from three 
					thousand years of language history more easily available to practitioners of other subfields, and stimulates an exchange of ideas between 
					Semitics and syntactic typology or even theoretical syntax. This must count as an important advance that shows great promise for future studies, 
					even if the author’s own conclusions may appear premature. In a field like Semitics in particular, with its strong philological heritage,

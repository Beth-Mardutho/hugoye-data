            <anchor corresp="P1"/>[1] The
    success of Beth Mardutho’s second annual <hi rend="italic">Dorushe</hi>
    conference demonstrated the continued growth of Syriac studies
    in graduate programs both in North America and Europe.
    Princeton University hosted the conference this year. Support
    for the conference was provided by Princeton University’s
    Department of Near Eastern Studies, the Group for the Study of
    Late Antiquity, the Center for the Study of Religion, the
    Program in Hellenic Studies, the History Department, the
    Program in the Ancient World, and the Dean of the Graduate
    School. With stimulating papers and responses, feedback from
    senior scholars, and enjoyable meals and even dancing, this
    year’s conference provided an excellent opportunity for
    intellectual exchange and professional development for the next
    generation of Syriac scholars. David Michelson, Ph.D. candidate
    in Princeton’s Department of History, organized the event
    with assistance from a Dorushe committee of students.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P2"/>[2] Students
    from nine universities and three countries presented papers on
    a wide variety of stimulating topics ranging from historical
    and literary studies to theological and philological
    investigations.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P3"/>[3] The
    conference began on Saturday, April 14, 2007. Dr. Emmanuel
    Papoutsakis of the Department of Near Eastern Studies at
    Princeton University and David Michelson welcomed the group. We
    heard excellent papers from students on Saturday afternoon and
    Sunday morning. Outside observers from several universities
    attended, and Gorgias Press set up an outstanding book
    display.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P4"/>[4] Saturday
    evening, after a lovely reception, conference participants
    celebrated together at a dinner hosted by Princeton. Prof.
    David Taylor of Oxford delivered an outstanding after-dinner
    talk. He spoke about changes in the field of Syriac studies in
    the last twenty-five years. He discussed how graduate students
    from both sides of the Atlantic can benefit and learn from the
    methodologies and approaches of one another and offered
    suggestions of topics in the field needing further research. On
    Sunday morning, after students presented their last papers,
    both Prof. Taylor and Dr. Papoutsakis offered closing remarks
    and conclusions for the group.</p>

    Following is a brief summary of the papers presented. On behalf
    of the Dorushe conference committee, I express our thanks to
    Princeton University and to the students who contributed to the
    success of the weekend. Students who wish to join Dorushe are
    urged to contact dorushe@bethmardutho.org. Tentatively, next
    year’s conference is planned for April 2008 at the
    University of Notre Dame.</p>

    <hi rend="italic">Elitzur Avraham Bar-Asher</hi> (Harvard University):
    “Syriac as an Eastern Aramaic Dialect: a Reassessment of
    the Evidence.” Elitzur Bar-Asher's paper reviewed the
    main scholarly positions on the topic of Syriac as an Eastern
    Aramaic dialect. This paper brings these discussions up to date
    by contributing new information and evaluating previous
    scholarship using methodologies from historical linguistics.
    This study also raised methodological problems concerning the
    study of Syriac. On account of inner evidence and comparison
    with phenomena in other eastern dialects, Bar-Asher suggested
    that Syriac be seen as an "Eastern literary language."</p>

    <hi rend="italic">Kevin Casey:</hi> (University of Toronto): “The Use
    and Interpretation of Scripture Amongst Muslim and Christian
    Exegetes of the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> through 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi>
    Centuries.” This paper discussed biblical interpretation
    in Syriac mystical literature: the recognition of levels of
    meaning in the scriptural text and the intersection of
    spiritual experience, religious practice and hermeneutics. This
    paper situated these principles of mystical hermeneutics within
    the larger debate concerning the interpretation and meaning of
    scripture which raged in the Late Antique Near East. The
    discussion pointed to some areas where, perhaps, these
    principles and this debate were absorbed and manifested in
    Islam. The Syriac author Dadišoʿ
    Qa<hi rend="u">t</hi>raya, for example, expands upon
    Antiochene theories of exegesis that reigned in the East Syrian
    Church in his discussion of the several senses
    (<hi rend="italic">sūkāle</hi>) of meaning in the word of
    Scripture: historical interpretation
    (<hi rend="italic">pūšāqā
    taš‛itānāyā</hi>), homiletic
    interpretation (<hi rend="italic">mtargmānāyā</hi>), and
    spiritual interpretation (<hi rend="italic">pūšāqā
    ru<hi rend="u">h</hi>ānāyā</hi>). Spiritual
    interpretation, for him, is a practice appropriate only for the
    solitaries and holy men. Early mystical commentary on the
    Qur’an took the form of short utterances and glosses of
    inspired speech that resulted from listening to and reciting
    the text of the Qur’an. Both Muslim and Christian mystics
    from the early Islamic period also single out the heart, not
    the mind, as the locus of the spiritual understanding of
    scripture. There are obvious similarities between the spiritual
    exegesis practiced by the monks of the Church of the East and
    the spiritual reading of the Qur’an found among the
    mystics of the first centuries of Islam.</p>

    <hi rend="italic">Miriam Goldstein:</hi> (Hebrew University):
    “Tafsīr al Tawrāt: Jewish and Christian
    Exegetes in the Muslim Empire.” Following the initial
    Muslim conquest of the Mediterranean and the Near East, a
    second, linguistic, conquest proved to be the most crucial
    transformation of the region. This was the conquest in which
    the Arabic language, which had taken root among the populations
    of the region even prior to the spread of Islam, replaced
    Aramaic. This provided a medium of discourse that encouraged
    the flow of ideas between groups that had formerly held one
    another at a distrustful distance. Most studies of
    interconfessional scholarly ties in the Muslim Empire till now
    have focused on Jewish–Muslim interaction, including the
    areas of law, theology, philosophy and literature.
    Jewish-Christian ties have been a striking omission. The study
    of biblical interpretation provides a natural point of entry to
    such research, for Jews and Christians held a common text, the
    Hebrew Bible, to be sacred. It is clear from numerous sources
    that scholars of the two groups were not only aware of each
    others’ interpretations; at times they actively sought
    the aid of each other in solving difficult exegetical problems.
    This paper sketched possible ties among exegetes of both
    religious traditions writing in Syriac/Aramaic and
    Arabic/Judeo-Arabic, both regarding interpretations of
    particular Scriptural verses as well as methodology.</p>

    <hi rend="italic">Henryk Jaronowski:</hi> (Leopold-Wenger-Institut für
    Rechtsgeschichte: University of Munich) “The Place of the
    Syro-Roman Law Book in Syrian legal Traditions.” The
    Syro-Roman Law Book (SRLB) presents scholars with a set of
    tantalizing and difficult questions. This paper addressed the
    question of the SRLB’s place in the Syrian legal
    traditions. Although the SRLB was continuously available and
    even translated into Arabic, Coptic, Armenian, and Georgian,
    citations of it are scarce. In the West Syrian tradition, only
    Bar Hebraeus (†1286) cites the SRLB. Although five East
    Syrian works cite it between the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> and
    13<hi rend="sup">th</hi> centuries, the SRLB does not seem to be an
    essential part of the East Syrian legal consciousness. There
    are certain passages of the SRLB, specifically on inheritance
    law, family law, the <hi rend="italic">arrha</hi>, and measurements, which
    are cited by multiple authors. This paper connected the
    citations to their source manuscripts and discussed how the
    repeated citations differ between authors, showing how the
    contents of the SRLB were used and adapted over time. The SRLB
    also appears in divergent West and East Syrian manuscript
    families, with different numbering and variations in text and
    content. Although Kaufhold and Selb’s 2002 critical
    edition of the SRLB edits, translates, and proposes a stemma
    for these various manuscripts, it does not treat the textual
    differences among them in detail. This paper characterized the
    differences in content between the two manuscript families and
    between the manuscripts in each family, evaluating how much and
    to what end the text was reworked.</p>

    <hi rend="italic">Vitalijs Permjakovs:</hi> (University of Notre Dame)
    “Two Spring Festivals in the Syriac Liturgical Calendar
    – Traces of an Archaic Calendar System?” This paper
    discussed two liturgical celebrations in the calendar used by
    the Syriac churches, both of West and East Syriac traditions.
    The first usually appears in the calendar under the title
    <hi rend="italic">dominica nova</hi> (<hi rend="u">h</hi>ad-b-sabâ<hi rend="u">h</hi>adthâ): the first Sunday after Easter. The
    second feast comes in the middle of May.  Often this is
    designated with the title “the Feast of the Theotokos
    over the ears of corn/grain.” They appear to be parts of
    two different calendrical cycles – one, the
    Easter-Pentecost cycle, another – the cycle of fixed
    Dominical/Marian feasts. However, these two
    liturgio-calendrical units represent elements of one, more
    archaic calendrical system that may be linked to Jewish
    calendars of the Temple period (Jubilees, Dead Sea Scrolls) and
    possibly to early Judeo-Christian communities. Across Christian
    traditions, including Syriac, the celebration of the first
    Sunday after Easter (<hi rend="italic">dominica</hi>, <hi rend="italic">dominica in
    albis</hi>, <hi rend="italic">kainê kyriakê</hi>,
    <hi rend="italic">antipascha</hi>) is marked as a solemn and festive
    occasion. The significance of this day may derive from its
    connection to particular calendrical traditions that can be
    traced to the ancient 364-day calendars. This paper examined
    whether liturgical data from the Syriac tradition gives any
    evidence for the <hi rend="italic">dominica nova</hi> being a part of this
    proposed ancient “calendar system:” the
    ‘beginning’ of the archaic Pentecost season.</p>

    <hi rend="italic">Robert Riggs</hi>: (University of Pennsylvania): “Ibn
    Qutayba’s Usage of Arabic Biblical Referents: A Place for
    Syriac Informants?” Even a cursory examination of the
    works of the famed Arabic litterateur Ibn Qutayba (d. 889 C.E.)
    reveals a plethora of Biblical or pseudo-Biblical references in
    a variety of his writings. While it is not unusual to find
    early Muslim authors referring to the Tawra (Torah), Injil
    (Gospel), and Zabur (Psalms) in their Qur’anic context,
    the lucidity and accuracy with which Ibn Qutayba uses
    references to the earlier revealed literature leads the reader
    to question his oral and textual informants. Unlike many of his
    Muslim contemporaries, who seemed to attribute authoritative
    status to a wide variety of apocryphal stories taken in part
    from the growing corpus of folk tales and myths, the <hi rend="italic" style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">qissas al-anbiya’</hi>,
    orally circulating during the milieu of the seventh to ninth
    centuries, Ibn Qutayba seems to draw from early textual sources
    which reflect a striking similarity to early Syriac and Hebrew
    manuscripts. This paper contrasted the use of Biblical
    references by early Muslim historians ‘Ali Rabban
    al-Tabari, Abu Ja‘far al-Tabari, and al-Ya‘qubi
    with the works of Ibn Qutayba to present a clearer view of the
    parallel usages and availability of Biblical texts in the ninth
    century.</p>

    <hi rend="italic">Jeanne-Nicole Saint-Laurent:</hi> (Brown University):
    “The Acts of Marī and the Rhetoric of Syriac
    Missionary Narratives.” Recent scholarship by F. and C.
    Jullien and A. Harrak have brought greater attention to the
    importance of the late sixth-, early seventh-century text, the
    <hi rend="italic">Acts of Mari.</hi> This foundation myth narrates the
    missionary tour of Mar Mari, the apostle of Babylonia, linked
    in East Syriac religious traditions with the Edessan apostle
    Addai. The text’s rhetoric distinguished Mari and his
    foundations from other apostolic missionaries, like Thomas and
    Addai. While the apocryphal text established continuity between
    Addai and Mari, it also constructed difference to set Mari
    apart and make his story the exclusive treasure of the East
    Syrian Dyophysite Church. The text created and reconfigured a
    hierarchy for the cities of Persia and Babylonia. The rhetoric
    and vocabulary of this text reveal a distinct thought world and
    network of East Syriac monasteries in which this story
    circulated. As Jullien and Jullien have argued, the <hi rend="italic">Acts of
    Mari</hi> must be interpreted in light of narratives of
    Manichean and Baptizing movements. As in the <hi rend="italic">Acts of
    Thomas</hi>, women serve to advance the mission of the
    patron-apostle. The authors of the <hi rend="italic">Acts of Mari</hi> used
    literary strategies of distinction to legitimize their origins
    as they stitched Mari’s itinerary into the literary
    framework of the apocryphal Acts narratives.</p>

    <hi rend="italic">Edward Schoolman:</hi> (UCLA): “From Antaura to the
    Evil Eye: Early Modern Syriac Magical Charms and their
    Pre-Christian Origin.” In 1912, Hermann Gollancz
    published a volume entitled <hi rend="italic">The Book of Protection</hi>, in
    which he edited and translated four collections of Syriac
    magical amulets and charms. These collections, compiled in the
    17<hi rend="sup">th</hi> and 18<hi rend="sup">th</hi> century in book form, do
    not follow the templates of ancient magical handbooks, but
    nevertheless preserve Christian charms and magical elements
    that have their antecedents in ancient Greek and Coptic
    traditions. This paper discussed a formula found numerous times
    in these texts and common to both this early modern Syriac
    collection and to ancient phylacteries and magical handbooks.
    The main feature of this spell type is an invocation of a
    helpful divine figure, which arrives to challenge a demonic
    one, with the interaction recorded in dialog, and the divine
    figure either turning away or binding the demonic one. A
    detailed comparison of this charm formula through pagan,
    early-Christian, and late Syriac contexts brings to light the
    adaptation of magical traditions across cultural, linguistic,
    and social lines.</p>

    <hi rend="italic">Michal Bar-Asher Siegal:</hi> (Yale University): “The
    Problem of Evil in the Syriac Translation of the Book of
    Ben-Sira.” This paper suggests that the treatment of evil
    in the book of Ben Sira caused the Syriac translator to change
    the content of the original text in several places. The
    translator found the treatment of the creation of evil in Ben
    Sira text problematic, particularly its suggestion of the
    possibility of predestined wicked men. In these cases, the
    Syriac translation tends to stress human choice and dims the
    sections of the text in which Ben Sira suggested divine
    determination and God’s creation of Evil. Outlining this
    motivation in the Syriac version brings new insights concerning
    previous scholarship on this translation, (such as Winter
    [1977]) and a rejection of their conclusions.</p>

    <hi rend="italic">Jeff Wickes:</hi> (University of Notre Dame): “The
    Literary Structure and Historical World Vision of
    Pseudo-Ephrem’s Sermon on the End of the World.”
    During the course of the later seventh and early eighth
    centuries, a number of works were composed in Syriac that
    depicted the initial Islamic conquests as harbingers of the
    world's end. These works enlisted a cast of characters to act
    out this apocalyptic drama: the "Sons of Hagar," or "Sons of
    Ishmael," Romans, Persians, and Alexander's Eschatological
    People of the North. All the characters that took part in these
    later seventh- and early eighth-century Syriac Christian
    representations of the end could be mapped onto actual
    historical figures, and thus the dramas functioned as
    commentaries on the world in which the authors and audiences
    lived. Moreover, the placement of these historical characters
    within a certain temporal framework—the brink of the end
    of time—aimed to alter audiences' perception of the time
    in which they lived.  One of the relevant themes within
    this emergent literature was the concept of time in
    Pseudo-Ephrem's “Homily on the End of the World.”
    Just as Ps. Ephrem’s presentation of the Islamic invaders
    sought to foster a certain perspective towards this, so, too,
    his presentation of time sought to alter their perception of
    the temporal space and the characters in these events.</p>

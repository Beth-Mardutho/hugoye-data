            <anchor corresp="P1"/>[1] It is
    with great sadness that we announce to <hi rend="italic">Hugoye</hi> readers
    the passing away of William ("Bill") Petersen at 7:30 PM, Dec.
    20, 2006 of a rapidly metastasizing kidney cancer (discovered
    only in July). Bill was a great friend of many of us, and he
    served on the editorial committee of Hugoye since its
    inception. Those of us who knew him well will miss him. Those
    of us who know him from his work will miss his work.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P2"/>[2] William
    Petersen was born in Laredo, Texas, U.S.A., in 1950. He
    obtained a Ph.D. from Utrecht University. A revised version of
    his dissertation appeared in 1985 as his first book, <hi rend="italic">The
    Diatessaron and Ephrem of Syrus as Sources of Romanos the
    Melodist</hi> (CSCO 475 [Subsidia 74] Peeters, 1985). "Since
    1999, he was Professor of New Testament and Christian Origins
    in the Religious Studies Program and also Professor in the
    Department of Classics and Ancient Mediterranean Studies at the
    Pennsylvania State University in University Park, Pennsylvania.
    Earlier he was Associate Professor in both of those divisions
    (1993-1999 and 1995-1999, respectively), and Assistant
    Professor of New Testament and Christian Origins (1990-1993).
    From 1998 to 2006 he served as Director of the Religious
    Studies Program at Penn State. Before joining that faculty, he
    was Visiting Assistant (1985-1986) and Assistant Professor
    (1986-1990) of Early Church History and Patristics at the
    University of Notre Dame."</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P3"/>[3] Bill is
    known to many of us from his Diatessaron studies. His knowledge
    of Syriac, Greek, Old High German, Old Saxon, and Middle
    English made him a perfect scholar for Diatessaronic studies.
    His major study <hi rend="italic">Tatian's Diatessaron. Its Creation,
    Dissemination, Significance and History in Scholarship</hi>
    (Leiden, New York, Cologne: Brill, 1994) will remain a standard
    reference for decades to come.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P4"/>[4] I had
    contacted Bill on August 1 of last year to ask him if he can
    write a Hugoye obituary for his doctoral Doktorvater Gilles
    Quispel. He reply was long and passionate. He declined for one
    reason: just a week earlier he had been diagnosed with
    "incurable" kidney cancer. Despite this he wrote, "Obviously
    I'm not happy about this, but as we both know, life is full of
    surprises, and we just have to accept them with as much grace
    and courage as we can." He continuously updated me on his
    situation and I in turn updated key scholars in the field. His
    last good bye message came just days before he passed away.</p>

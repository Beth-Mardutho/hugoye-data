         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P1"/>[1] On June
    20, 2001, representatives of The Catholic University of America
    (CUA), Brigham Young University (BYU), and Beth Mardutho met
    together to discuss the digital imaging of key holdings in the
    Semitics/ICOR Library of CUA’s Mullen Library.
    CUA’s Semitics/ICOR Library houses one of the largest
    collections in the world of early and rare books on the
    Christian East. All parties shared a particular interest in
    early Syriac printed works, both for their continuing value to
    contemporary Syriac Christian communities as well as to Syriac
    scholars. Many early printed catalogs, text editions, grammars,
    lexica, and other instrumenta and studies have never been
    superseded. Their rarity and inaccessibility to scholars has
    long been a serious problem for the field of Syriac
    studies.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P2"/>[2] The
    faculty and staff of Catholic University recognized this need
    as well, and generously agreed to work with BYU and Beth
    Mardutho to provide digital access to their collection. BYU and
    Beth Mardutho entered into a three-way agreement with CUA to
    scan a broad selection of their Syriac book holdings, with BYU
    focusing on titles of primarily academic interest and Beth
    Mardutho on materials of more broad interest to the Syriac
    churches. The result of the BYU project with CUA is now almost
    complete, and Web access to the imaged titles is being provided
    free of cost as the BYU-CUA Syriac Studies Reference Library at
    <ref target="http://www.lib.byu.edu/dlib/cua/">http://www.lib.byu.edu/dlib/cua/</ref>.
    A list of the titles included in this collection can be found
    at the following BYU site: <ref target="http://cpart.byu.edu/completed/referencelibrary.php">http://cpart.byu.edu/completed/referencelibrary.php</ref>.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P3"/>[3] The
    Semitics/ICOR Library houses some 45,000 books and periodicals,
    20,000 of which were the bequest of CUA’s first great
    semitist and orientalist, Prof. Henri Hyvernat. Much of the
    cataloging of these early works has never been migrated to
    computer, and a number of early Syriac titles had never been
    cataloged at all. Fr. Matthew Streett, a doctoral candidate in
    Biblical Studies at CUA, was appointed Project Bibliographer
    and compiled a 400 page bibliography of Syriac materials in the
    CUA collections. With this finding aid in hand, BYU and CUA
    collaborated with Dr. David Taylor of the University of Oxford
    to determine which items were of the highest academic value and
    should be targeted by the project.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P4"/>[4] A staff
    of 14 technicians was assembled from the CUA libraries, the
    School of Library and Information Science, and from graduate
    academic departments and programs with an interest in Syriac,
    with additional assistance from members of the Syriac Christian
    community. A total of 667 books, articles, and other media were
    scanned. The images scanned for BYU were returned to
    BYU’s Harold B. Lee library and turned over to
    specialists in the L. Tom Perry Special Collections imaging
    lab. There the more than 30,000 images were individually split
    and cropped, straightened, renamed, resized, sharpened,
    converted to PDF, and tagged with metadata. Indexing
    hierarchies were created and the images are being distributed
    via the Web using CONTENTdm digital collection management
    software. The images scanned by Beth Mardutho are also being
    published on the Web by the Hill Museum and Manuscript Library
    at <ref target="http://www.hmml.org">http://www.hmml.org</ref>.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P5"/>[5] Imaging
    for BYU was done with a Zeutschel Omniscan 10000 TT color book
    scanner tethered to a Windows PC, with a second PC used for
    proofing and data backup on DVD. The Zeutschel book scanner is
    capable of producing very high resolution scans with high color
    accuracy, yet with a minimum of stress to a book or manuscript.
    Images were captured at 600dpi in 24-bit color. While many of
    the published images have been downsized, to facilitate Web
    distribution and viewing, the resulting images are still very
    high resolution and of superb quality.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P6"/>[6] The
    online collection may be navigated in three ways. From the
    project's home page at <ref target="http://www.lib.byu.edu/dlib/cua">http://www.lib.byu.edu/dlib/cua</ref>,
    a drop-down menu allows the user to browse titles by ancient
    author, or to simply browse all. A second drop-down menu allows
    the user to browse by topic, or the user may search by keyword.
    Each method will return a corresponding browse/search page
    listing all of the titles that contain the selected keyword or
    term in any of their metadata fields, and from this page one
    may then view individual items.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P7"/>[7] In the
    item view, individual volume pages are viewable on the right.
    On the left is a navigation pane that provides a hot-linked
    table of contents which allows the user direct page-level
    navigation. Each page is a separate Adobe Acrobat (.pdf) file
    which is viewed and manipulated via the Adobe Reader browser
    plug-in. This allows the rapid download of individual pages and
    offers the user a large degree of viewing control.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P8"/>[8] Also
    provided at the bottom of the navigation pane is a link to a
    monolithic Acrobat file of the entire work. For large,
    multi-volume works this file may be very large (500mb or
    larger), but some users may wish to download frequently used
    works for off-line access. The reason for the large file size
    is the high resolution of the images, but the resulting detail
    is spectacular. As high-speed internet connections become more
    and more the norm these large file sizes will become
    increasingly less consequential, but we have nevertheless
    adopted here a content delivery system that is usable even with
    dial-up access.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P9"/>[9] From the
    outset, this collaborative effort has aimed to make a
    meaningful contribution to the growing body of Syriac materials
    now freely available in electronic format. We hope this aim has
    been met, and that the ease with which this particular
    collection can now be accessed will be a boon to the field of
    Syriac studies.</p>

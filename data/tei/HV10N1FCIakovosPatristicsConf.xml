            <anchor corresp="P1"/>[1] The
    Stephen and Catherine Pappas Patristic Institute of the Holy
    Cross Greek Orthodox School of Theology is pleased to announce
    its third annual Archbishop Iakovos Graduate Student Conference
    in Patristic Studies on March 15-17, 2007. The purpose of the
    conference is to bring graduate students together from the
    fields of Patristic Studies, Historical Theology, and the
    History of Christianity in Late Antiquity in a collaborative
    and theological setting to hear and discuss peer research. The
    conference begins on Thursday, March 15, at 5:00 p.m., and ends
    after dinner on Saturday evening, March 17.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P2"/>[2] We are
    now calling for paper proposals. We strongly encourage all
    doctoral and masters students with research interests in
    Patristics, Historical Theology, or the History of Christianity
    in Late Antiquity to submit a paper abstract of approximately
    250 words. Topics relating to eastern Christianity are
    particularly encouraged. For an example of the range of topics,
    look at the paper titles from last year's conference at
    <ref target="http://www.pappaspatristic.hchc.edu/">www.pappaspatristic.hchc.edu</ref>. Each presenter will
    have up to 20 minutes to present, followed by a prepared
    response and discussion. Please send abstracts to Dr. Bruce
    Beck at beck.bruce@comcast.net no later than February 5th. You
    will be informed about the status of your paper proposal on or
    before February 15th. Completed papers will be due by March 3rd
    in order to allow the respondents sufficient preparation
    time.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P3"/>[3] For
    those living outside the Boston area, partial financial aid is
    available to assist with travel and lodging expenses. For this
    conference last year, the Patristic Institute reimbursed a
    significant percentage of all travel and lodging costs for all
    those who requested aid; so, please include your request for
    financial aid when you pre-register for the conference (see
    below), with an estimated cost for airfare or other
    transportation to and from the conference. All requests for
    financial aid need to be received no later than March 3rd.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P4"/>[4] All
    participants must pre-register at their earliest convenience
    for planning purposes. There is no registration fee or cost for
    meals during the conference. To register, please email Bruce
    Beck (beck.bruce@comcast.net) with your personal information,
    including address, phone number, institution, degree program,
    area of study, and dissertation topic. Also, please indicate
    whether you would be willing to respond to a paper in your
    field of interest. Conference lodging will be at the Walker
    Center, a conference center about 12 minutes from the campus.
    If you will need lodging, please register as early as possible
    to facilitate reserving a place for you to stay. For more
    information and updates, please refer to the Institute's
    website <ref target="http://www.pappaspatristic.hchc.edu/">www.pappaspatristic.hchc.edu</ref>.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P5"/>[5] Founded
    in 2003 by a generous grant from the late Stephen Pappas and
    his wife Catherine, the goal of the Pappas Patristic Institute
    is the advancement and promotion of primarily Greek and other
    eastern patristic studies in the service of the academy and of
    the Church.</p>

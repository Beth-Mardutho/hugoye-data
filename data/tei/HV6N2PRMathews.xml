         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P1"/>[1] It is
    unlikely that readers of this journal will require any
    introduction to the work of Françoise Petit. Many years ago she
    began a study of the Biblical Commentaries of Procopius of
    Gaza, but this has become a lifelong project of producing
    editions of the various <hi rend="italic">Catenae</hi> traditions which has
    already resulted in a number of extremely useful volumes,
    including editions of the Sinai <hi rend="italic">Catena</hi> material on
    Genesis and Exodus (CCSG 2, 1977), the Coislin <hi rend="italic">Catena</hi>
    material on Genesis (CCSG 15, 1986), a four volume edition of
    all the <hi rend="italic">Catena</hi> material on Genesis (TEG 1-4, 1991-96),
    and two of three projected volumes of an edition of the
    <hi rend="italic">Catena</hi> material on Exodus (TEG 10-11, 2001-02). The
    volume under review here comprises those <hi rend="italic">Catena</hi>
    fragments on the text of Exodus attributed to Severus,
    patriarch of Antioch and one of the leading theologians of the
    Monophysite party (c. 465-538).</p>
         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P2"/>[2] The
    fragments of Severus on Exodus edited here fall into very
    distinct stages of the <hi rend="italic">Catena</hi> tradition. The composition
    of the <hi rend="italic">Catena on Exodus</hi> clearly underwent three clearly
    discernible stages in its transmission. The initial compilation
    was made around the middle of the fifth century, while it is
    the secondary stage that is characterized by the insertion of
    those quotations attributed to Severus of Antioch. The third
    and final stage is then marked by the further insertion—into
    the secondary stage of transmission only!—of a collection of
    texts built up around the <hi rend="italic">Quaestiones</hi> of Theodoret of
    Cyrrhus along with a reworking of the earlier materials,
    including those fragments attributed to Severus. It seems
    likely that the <hi rend="italic">Catena</hi> fragments attributed to Severus,
    found for nearly all the books of the bible both Old and New
    Testament, were all added in at this second stage of
    redaction—it was also the case for the fragments on Genesis—but
    final conclusions must await publication of critical editions
    of all the <hi rend="italic">Catena</hi> materials.</p>
         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P3"/>[3] The
    volume here under review is organized into three very clear and
    well-defined sections. The introduction (pp. xi-xxvii)
    discusses in a very concise manner the matters of the
    manuscripts containing the <hi rend="italic">Catena on Exodus</hi>, the stages
    of transmission, the sources of the fragments in the vast œuvre
    of Severus, as well as a brief discussion of Severus'
    theological position. The succinct discussion of each of these
    matters reflects Petit's great learning and intimate
    familiarity with the <hi rend="italic">Catenae</hi> traditions.</p>
         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P4"/>[4] The bulk
    of the volume is, of course, devoted to an edition of the
    fragments (pp. 1-101). There are a total of eighty-eight
    fragments which are numbered not 1-88, but rather according to
    their place in Petit's own nearly completed <hi rend="italic">Édition
    Intégrale</hi>. Of those that can be identified, the predominant
    majority of the fragments, forty-six, are from the <hi rend="italic">Cathedral
    Homilies</hi>, five from the largely unedited <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi>,
    and three are from the polemical tracts <hi rend="italic">Against Julian of
    Halicarnassus</hi>. Of the remaining fragments twenty-two are
    repetitions, four can not be identified, and there are eight
    that are falsely attributed to Severus. In addition to a
    critical edition of the Greek fragments, Petit appends on
    facing pages a new French translation of each fragment. Tables
    of Biblical References and of the occurrences of the
    <hi rend="italic">Homily</hi> fragments by homily complete this section (pp.
    105-109).</p>
         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P5"/>[5] The
    third and final section, according to the title page, is a
    Syriac glossary by Lucas Van Rompay. What Van Rompay has done,
    however, is actually more than to supply a simple glossary; he
    has rather provided a bilingual Greek-Syriac, Syriac-Greek
    glossary (pp. 132-208), and has prefaced them with a discussion
    of "Les versions syriaques" (pp. 111-131). In these twenty
    pages Van Rompay provides a detailed description of the
    translation technique of Jacob of Edessa's (d.708) Syriac
    translations of Severus' <hi rend="italic">Cathedral Homilies</hi> (fragments
    of earlier Syriac translations have survived, most notably
    those of Paul of Callinicos from the sixth century, but barely
    80 of the known 125 homilies have survived and have yet to be
    edited; it is this later translation of Jacob that has survived
    in a relatively complete version and is the only one that
    exists in modern critical editions [various <hi rend="italic">PO</hi> vols.,
    1906-1977; cf. <hi rend="italic">CPG</hi> 7035]). Van Rompay has limited his
    discussion to the Exodus <hi rend="italic">Catena</hi> fragments that are from
    the <hi rend="italic">Cathedral Homilies</hi>, so does not consider other
    extant Greek fragments such as Hom. 77 which has survived in a
    complete Greek version or those fragments recently published by
    Allen and Dorival, but his discussion still improves and
    expands the earlier attempt of C.J.A. Lash to describe Jacob's
    translation technique.</p>
         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P6"/>[6] The
    obvious and greatest contribution of this volume is the edition
    of the fragments. Any new edition of early Christian texts is
    of great value, but the importance of these fragments is
    increased as they provide heretofore unknown Greek originals of
    pieces of Severus' works that have otherwise survived only in
    Syriac (or in a few instances, Coptic) translation. She also
    provides the reworked version found in stage three of the
    transmission where they are available. As Petit herself states:
    "La confrontation des citations de la chaîne avec le texte
    syriaque garantit leur fidélité littérale et souvent permet de
    mieux interpréter la version orientale. (p. xix)" Applying this
    assertion, Petit proffers new French translations of these
    fragments as ameliorations of the existing <hi rend="italic">PO</hi>
    translations of the Syriac. While these fragments can in no way
    be considered a running commentary on Exodus—Severus was after
    all a theologian, not a biblical commentator à la Jerome or
    Chrysostom—it is nevertheless very instructive to see how
    Severus exegetes such pericopes as the burning bush (frags
    69-86), the manna in the jar (fr. 511), or the description of
    the Ark of the Covenant (frags. 764-768). With this slim volume
    Petit has rendered a great service to scholars of Severus and,
    together with the sections by Van Rompay, has added
    significantly to the study of Syriac translation of Greek
    works.</p>
         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P7"/>[7] At the
    beginning of her introduction, Ms. Petit expresses the regret
    at not having thought at the time to publish the <hi rend="italic">Catena</hi>
    fragments on Genesis attributed to Severus in a separate
    monograph (p. xi). After seeing this volume, it would seem, to
    this reviewer at least, highly unlikely that anyone would
    complain if she were to go back and publish these fragments. At
    the very least, it seems that Ms. Petit will continue to
    publish many more editions of Severus' Greek fragments, in
    addition to her complete editions of the <hi rend="italic">Catenae</hi>
    materials, to which we can all eagerly look forward.</p>

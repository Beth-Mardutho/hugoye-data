    Both authors utilize the narrative of Genesis 3-4 to model

         </p>
            </note> introduces the unsuspecting reader to the wealth
    of Syriac exegesis and midrash.  Ephrem receives most of
    his attention, but Aphrahat, Narsai, Jacob of Serug, Bar
    Hebraeus, and Theodore of Mopsuestia are also cited. 
    Still, Anderson’s book can only reveal the tip of the
    iceberg of Syriac interpretation of the events in the Garden of
    Eden.
    <p>
            <anchor corresp="P2"/>[2] I wish
    to offer a brief note regarding two other Syriac
    witnesses.  Anderson delves deeply into Jewish midrashic
    commentaries,<note place="foot" xml:id="FN2" n="2">

    Rabbah, the Babylonian Talmud</hi> are frequent sources for

    story is an Armenian translation of <hi rend="italic">Life of Adam and

         </p>
                </note> but here the agenda is unabashedly
    Christian.  First, I will fill out the picture given by
    the anonymous Book of Steps (<hi rend="italic">Liber Graduum</hi>) in
    <hi rend="italic">mēmrē</hi> 15 and 21 of that collection.<note place="foot" xml:id="FN3" n="3">

    Second, Philoxenus of Mabbug offers a distinct approach in
    several of his Ascetical Homilies or Discourses.<note place="foot" xml:id="FN4" n="4">

    authors shape their interpretations around the requirements of
    the ascetical and monastic communities under their pastoral

            <anchor corresp="P4"/>[4] The Book
    of Steps is an anonymous collection of 30
    <hi rend="italic">mēmrē</hi> on various aspects of the spiritual
    life.  Written in a pre-monastic setting of the
    mid-late-fourth century, probably well inside the Persian
    Empire, the Book revolves around the two levels of committed
    Christians, the Upright (<hi rend="italic">kēnē</hi>) and the Perfect
    (<hi rend="italic">gmīrē</hi>).  The Upright perform acts of
    charity and ministry for the poor while often being married and
    receiving income from occupations.  The Perfect are
    celibate, do not work or perform acts of charity, practice
    unceasing prayer, and wander throughout the region teaching and
    resolving conflicts.<note place="foot" xml:id="FN6" n="6">

    Philoxenus’ 13 long <hi rend="italic">mēmrē</hi> also address
    the spiritual life, but out of a changed situation.  His

                </note>  He is the only
    other Syriac writer to utilize the terms and institutions of
    the Upright and Perfect, albeit with a different configuration
    of boundaries and duties.  In both works, Genesis 3-4
    provides the paradigm of the ultimate goal for the ascetical
    life—the return to the Garden of Eden—as well as
    the model of how not to get there.</p>
         <head xml:id="HV6N1Kitchen3">Perfect Eden</head>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P6"/>[6] The
    author of the Book of Steps assumes the Garden of Eden embodied
    God’s intended existence for human beings, i.e. the
    status of Perfection (<hi rend="italic">gmīrūtā</hi>), which is
    also described as the status of the angels.  The goal of
    the Perfect ones in the faith community of the Book of Steps is
    to regain this status and condition that Adam had lost. 
    The purpose of Jesus' advent and humbling is to show us that
    original truth God gave to Adam before he sinned<note place="foot" xml:id="FN8" n="8">
                    <p rend="footnote text">
             “The whole [reason] why Christ came and
    lowered himself was in order to teach us how we might lower
    ourselves in imitation of him and to show [us] that original
    truth,” (21: 593:7-9). 
         </p>
                </note> (21;
    593:17-19).  "Adam lived at first according to the perfect
    will of God.  This one who came, Jesus, showed to whomever
    wishes how to imitate him and be perfected" (21;
    600:20-23).</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P7"/>[7] The Book
    of Steps author apparently knows of the legends of the fall of
    Satan from grace in heaven as described by Anderson. <note place="foot" xml:id="FN9" n="9">
                    <p rend="footnote text">
             Anderson, <hi rend="italic">Genesis</hi>, Chapter 1: “The
    Fall of Satan and the Elevation of Adam,” 21-41. 
         </p>
                </note>  
    “Adam fell from heaven with that [same] fall by which the
    Rebel slipped and fell.  For the idea came upon the Rebel
    to become God.  When he was ruined he came to allure Adam
    so that he might slip and fall to become his son and
    disciple” (21; 628:18-23).  The title of Rebel for
    Satan reflects the Jewish and Christian tale of the arrogance
    of Satan the angel who rebelled against the Lord God, wanting
    power more than perfection.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P8"/>[8]
    Noteworthy is the relatively little attention Eve receives
    throughout all the comments and exegeses of Genesis 3-4 in the
    Book of Steps.  Adam is saddled with the brunt of the
    blame for the fall from grace and perfection on behalf of all
    of humanity, as Anderson found in several other
    traditions.<note place="foot" xml:id="FN10" n="10">

         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P9"/>[9] The 21st
    <hi rend="italic">mēmrā</hi> of the Book of Steps, “On the Tree
    of Adam,” witnesses to the kind of Christian exegesis
    that perceives the story in the Garden of Eden as the anti-type
    to the Gospel Passion narrative, a kind of anti-Passion
    narrative.  The tree of the knowledge of good and evil is
    identified by the author as equivalent to the Evil One;<note place="foot" xml:id="FN11" n="11">
                    <p rend="footnote text">
             “Now I will begin to explain about the
    good tree, how it exists and how it stands, and concerning the
    tree of the knowledge of good and evil which is the Evil One,
    toil, anxiety, and the thought of transitory things by which
    Adam and Eve tasted death.  For through it they came to
    know evil that they had not known.  After they ate from it
    they knew evil, which is death, [which] they had not
    known”  (584:1-7). 
         </p>
                </note> in
    fact, the author dubs Satan as “the Tree”
    (585:5).  Jesus Christ, on the other hand, is given the
    title of the Good Tree, the tree of life.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P10"/>[10]
    Eating from the tree of Good and Evil is a metaphor for being
    bound to the earth and transitory things.  The action of
    eating itself is not dwelt upon, though in the 15th
    <hi rend="italic">mēmrā</hi> the author echoes Paul (1 Corinthians
    8:8) that “food does not commend us before God,”
    for those who follow this way “have forgotten God after
    they have eaten and reveled” (15; 348:6-11).</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P11"/>[11]
    Conscious that the most prevalent theory regarding the cause of
    the Fall is the initiation of sexual intercourse, the author
    reduces the desire for intercourse or lust to a secondary
    impulse subordinate to the desire for earthly and transitory
    things.  Underlying all these urges and drives is the
    desire to become equal to God.  “They did not really
    desire it (intercourse - <hi rend="italic">shawtpūtā</hi>), but [they
    did so] in that hope that they would become great like
    God” (Romans 8:20) (15; 340:8-9).  The Gospel
    Passion lays bare the weakness of such grasping after
    greatness.  “Adam despised [God’s] words and
    broke his commandments and sought to usurp, to become the equal
    of God in majesty, but not in lowliness” (21;
    616:6-10).</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P12"/>[12] The
    author turns directly to his spiritual charges and draws the
    implication for how they are to live today. 
    “Nothing brought down Adam but pride.  My brothers,
    let us free ourselves from pride, lest we become like salt
    whose flavor is lost” (21; 616:24-617:10).  Pride is
    thus the insidious emotion that not only thinks one is better
    and more skilled than another, but ultimately ends up believing
    one can replicate God’s actions and being.  One of
    the author’s persistent citations throughout the Book of
    Steps is Philippians 2:3: “This is the perfect and
    straight road, ‘Consider every person better than
    yourself’” (19; 469:6).  Lowliness or humility
    (<hi rend="italic">makīkūtā</hi>), not majesty or divinization,
    is the foundation for the life of the aspiring Perfect or
    Upright one.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P13"/>[13] In a
    way, the so-called Fall was God’s fault. 
    Acknowledging the omnipotence and omniscience of God, the
    author understands that in allowing free choice to human
    beings, God has opened the door to certain wrong choices. 
    Yet our fall was far from inevitable or necessary, the author
    declares, for if Adam had obeyed and said no to Satan, God
    would have provided children for Adam and Eve without lust, and
    food would have appeared (à la manna) without labor (21;
    601:14-26).</p>

    Eve’s role is significant as the intermediary between
    Adam and the Evil One, especially in light of her being largely

    “In this way also [the Evil One] seduced Adam with deceit
    and approached him as someone concerned [for him] and a bearer
    of [his] burden.  He counseled Eve to advise Adam and
    commanded her to speak to Adam so that he might acquire wealth
    and become a king.  ‘Look, gold and silver are on
    the earth and all sorts of pleasures.  Possess and enjoy
    yourself; rule, increase, and multiply,’ the Evil One
    counseled.  ‘Cast off from yourself asceticism and
    renunciation and holiness (celibacy), also lowliness, and know
    evil as well as good things and grow and become like God who
    created you.’ </p>

    “Eve advised Adam, ‘That rebel advised us well, if

    him, ‘Our Creator commanded us not to obey you, nor eat
    from [the tree], nor be united with earthly things;’ that
    is, we should not labor or possess anything on the

    become like him.’  Adam said, ‘If he does not
    desire that we become like this, will he not punish us because
    we have dared [to do this]?’  The Evil One said,
    ‘When you become like him, what can he do to
    you?’” (21; 609:2-25).</p>

    identifies the Evil One not as evil, but again as the Rebel to
    whom she grants the honor and wisdom of precedence and age.
     The narrative implies that the Evil One never speaks
    directly to Adam, always through Eve, yet the Evil One’s
    purpose is to seduce Adam.  Eve’s seduction is
    secondary, a mere by-product.</p>

                </note>  The author deals with this

    innate in the makeup of human beings? 
    <hi rend="italic">Mēmrā</hi> 15, “On Adam’s Marital
    Desire,” works to solve the enigma and concludes No, that
    it is not the way we originally were, for the sexual instinct
    was introduced into humanity by the Evil One.  Adam and
    Eve, after all, were naked and did not recognize their
    situation, similar to infants and very young children who
    simply do not know what nakedness is and certainly do not know
    what lust is.  “In this they [Adam and Eve] did not
    have a despicable thought, but if they had known [that they
    were naked], they would have put on clothes” (15;
    340:15-17).</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P20"/>[20] The
    conclusive proof that Adam and Eve originally did not possess
    lust is a humorous observation of a natural phenomenon. 
    “Therefore, what man or woman is able to stand before one
    another naked and not have the lust in their heart aroused,
    seeing one another naked, apart from those whose heart is pure
    from lust and who are holy in their heart and bodies, just as
    Adam and Eve were before they had sinned?  On account of
    this our Lord said, ‘If you do not turn back and become
    like these children, you will not become like that first
    creation of Adam,’ who had not yet transgressed against
    the commandment of his Maker.  Before Adam and Eve had
    sinned, they were naked like infants, but since the lust in
    their heart was not aroused they were not ashamed, just as
    infants are not ashamed” (15; 340:17-341:5).</p>

    “So today when the descendants of Adam who love holiness
    (celibacy) have striven against and killed the sin from the
    heart with lowliness and love, then they will abandon physical
    lust and turn away from it, ascending to the desire for
    God.  Then God will command that lust be removed from the
    heart and the instinct [for sexual intercourse] from the body
    completely.  Then they will become ‘holy’ like
    children” (15; 341:12-21).  Only those who are able
    to be holy, celibate, and rid themselves of any feelings of
    lust can be Perfect.</p>

    Sexuality and lust always seem to occupy first place in the
    minds of interpreters, but the author of the Book of Steps
    understands the true conflict to be between the primacy of the
    disciple’s orientation toward the spiritual and heavenly,
    or toward the physical and earthly.  “But after they
    ate from the tree, that is, after they had abandoned heaven and
    loved the earth, their mind came from heaven to their bodies,
    [and] then they saw that they were naked.  For they had
    been in heaven while they were walking on the earth” (21;
    605:8-13).  “Because he had desired to become
    physical and not spiritual, that is, earthly and not heavenly,
    it was then that carnal desire came to exist in him, for Adam
    desired intercourse as a result of the teaching of the Evil One
    who had plotted to make him fall from the sanctity (celibacy)
    of the angels and imitate wild beasts” (15;

    Imitating wild beasts, rather than the angels, demonstrates the

    an original Adam, but live in the model of their teacher,
    Jesus, who also regained and fulfilled these Edenic
    standards.  The ideal of wandering, to have no place to
    lay down one’s head, follows Jesus’ directive

    Philoxenus, bishop of Mabbug, wrote a number of letters and
    <hi rend="italic">mēmrē</hi> to monks under his episcopal
    guidance.  In most cases, the great theological and
    Christological issues of the day were his subject matter,
    particularly in his role as one of the chief advocates for the
    henophysite perspective on the nature of Christ.  In his
    13 Discourses or Ascetical Homilies, however, Christology
    barely makes an appearance.  His intent is to instruct his
    charges, and particularly novices, in the spiritual
    disciplines.  While Philoxenus does utilize a modified
    Upright/Perfect dichotomy, his references to the Genesis
    narrative are of a different character.  The monks are
    called upon to reenter the purity of Eden, but to do so more
    via interior spiritual transformation than through external
    roles and actions.</p>
         <p>

    the monks, one assumes, are celibate, so the boundary issues of

    are beyond the pale.  Wealth and possessions are generally
    a much smaller concern than for the Book of Step’s
    Upright ones who are business people and have disposable
    incomes.  The monks all do have a place to lay down their

    to demonstrate that the basic aspect of simplicity is that one
    never questions the commands of God – a useful principle
    to underline for monks under the authority of an abbot and
    bishop.  Adam and Eve possessed simplicity until they
    encountered the Enemy who manipulated Adam into exercising
    judgement on God’s command to him, i.e. that he should
    not eat from the fruit of the tree (4; 80:5-81:20).<note place="foot" xml:id="FN19" n="19">

    “The advice which [the Enemy] brought to that childlike

    him.  Because it had destroyed his simplicity, [Adam] did
    not prosper in his judgment, for he deemed foolishly that it is
    appropriate to listen to an enemy rather than to a
    friend” (4; 81:1-4).  Philoxenus sees Adam bearing
    the weight of culpability as the latter has sunk to become a
    judge, the reverse of the status earthly society would grant to
    a judge.</p>

    Philoxenus characterizes the simplicity of Adam and Eve as that
    which allows them to talk directly with God just as they would
    with a close acquaintance.  During this time their
    simplicity never thought to ask questions about God’s
    nature or being (4; 83:17-84:5).  The various forms of
    contemplative prayer are aided by a less intellectual
    approach.  Perhaps this is a sly jab at himself and all
    who participate in Christological controversies.</p>

            <anchor corresp="P37"/>[37] In
    the sixth <hi rend="italic">mēmrā</hi> on the fear of God, Philoxenus
    enlists the example of Adam to show his deficiency in this
    area.  Adam believed in God, but once he cast out the fear
    of God from his mind he abandoned the faith (6;
    185:21-186:4).  Faith is not a simple profession, but the
    confession of one’s lowliness, simplicity in deference to
    God.</p>
         <p>

    most interesting detail about Adam comes from a backhanded
    reference in the discussion of John the Baptist as the greatest
    of the prophets.  Philoxenus observes that John received
    the Holy Spirit while still in the womb in order that he might
    attain the innocence (<hi rend="italic">shapyūtā</hi>) of Adam before
    he had sinned against the commandment (9; 300:10-302:19). 
    Philoxenus shares roughly the same tradition as the author of

    his transgression.</p>

    this particular church, celibacy, marital desire, and sexual
    instinct are competing directions that inevitably lead one back
    to the events in Eden.  The author sees that human beings
    were originally angelic in nature, and that sexual instincts
    were implanted in humanity by the wiles of Satan. 
    Sexuality, therefore, is not natural.  Nevertheless, the
    author grants legitimacy to the marital instinct as a God-given
    arrangement initiated during Adam and Eve’s last moments
    in Eden.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P43"/>[43] The
    author of the Book of Steps perceives a deeper conflict
    underlying the tension between celibacy and marriage: the
    division between the lower level of the Upright who bind
    themselves to the earth’s agenda; and the Perfect who
    aspire to and dwell in the angelic, heavenly status. 
    Prior to the Fall, prior to “realized nakedness”
    (apologies to C. H. Dodd), life in Eden was indistinguishable
    from heaven.  What beset Adam and Eve was their desire for
    earthly things – food, sexuality, clothing, possessions
    – suggested seductively and convincingly by Satan and his
    colleagues.  Once clothing became a concern, other earthly
    burdens accumulated.  The author wants to reestablish the
    angelic existence of Eden in which nakedness and lust and
    earthly matters are not even categories by which one
    thinks.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P44"/>[44]
    Still again, on an even deeper level, the author interprets the
    disaster in Eden as the consequence of a creature attempting to
    usurp the position and power of the Creator and become
    God.  One doesn’t have to live in Eden for this to
    be a temptation, especially if one believes that he or she has
    attained the status of the angels.</p>

    Philoxenus does not have to work so hard with his community of
    the Upright and the Perfect.  The tensions over celibacy
    and sexuality do not disappear, but are not of the same caliber
    as in the Book of Steps.  Whether these were monks at
    Senun or some other monastery, the question of marriage would
    be analogous to nakedness for Adam and Eve while Adam had not
    yet sinned – the thought would never have occurred to
    them.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P46"/>[46]
    Philoxenus does not seem to need to recite the entire narrative
    of Genesis 3-4 as the author of the Book of Steps does. 
    Genesis is utilized by Philoxenus to model the interior
    spiritual state of Perfection towards which all his monks were
    laboring.  Simplicity, prayer, fear of God, and innocence
    all function more efficiently in an enclosed monastic community
    attempting to draw the boundaries of the Garden of Eden around
    them.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P47"/>[47] For
    both the author of the Book of Steps and for Philoxenus, Eden
    still exists and can be reentered. Wherever human beings have
    attained the status of Perfection, there the Garden exists and
    the regrettable events recorded in Genesis 3-4 have been
    reversed.</p>_______<lb/>

         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P1"/>[1] The very
    first Aram Society International Conference (on the Nabataeans)
    was held as recently as 1989, but such has been the driving
    energy and enthusiasm of the Society's founder, Shafiq
    AbouZayd, that it has now hosted the twentieth in the series.
    To mark this major milestone in the history of the society,
    scholars came from around the world - South America, the Middle
    East, the United States, and Europe - to present papers on the
    appropriately celebratory theme of 'Alcohol'. As usual in Aram
    conferences, papers by art historians and archaeologists were
    mixed with those of specialists in literature, history, and
    theology, and on this occasion the periods discussed ranged
    across many millennia.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P2"/>[2] Maria
    Teresa Viviani presented a paper on the iconographic
    representation of alcoholic beverages and their consumption in
    third millennium BCE Sumer and Akkad. Beer was consumed by all
    classes of society, and the images of separate groups of both
    men and women sitting sociably around large communal jars of
    beer, sucking on huge straws, will not soon be forgotten by
    those who saw them. (It may well start a whole new craze in
    faculty parties!) Moving to the mid-second millennium, Natascha
    Bagherpour Kashani reappraised the ancient Hittite 'cultic
    vase' from Inandik. She convincingly argued that its cultic
    function should be interpreted in the light of the images
    painted upon it, which portray the brewing, conveying, and
    consumption of beer in vessels similar in form to the vase, as
    part of a religious ritual. The professionalism of the paper
    was all the more outstanding given that the speaker is only
    just completing her first degree. The third and final paper
    concerned with beer was that of Max Nelson who, drawing upon
    his forthcoming book on the subject, 'The Barbarian Beverage',
    described its production in the Graeco-Roman world, including
    northern Europe, and the attitudes towards it of contemporary
    writers.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P3"/>[3] Skipping
    on to the second half of the first millennium, and moving from
    beer to wine, Steven Derfler gave an illustrated account of the
    excavation of wine presses at Tel Michal and the Sharon in
    Israel, great centres of regional wine production over an
    extraordinary period of time. The technology needed for wine
    pressing was also explored by Amos Kloner who described the
    structures and installations at Hulda, and some of the
    corresponding data from Lebanon was presented by Moheb
    Chanesaz.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P4"/>[4] Several
    papers explored the economic and social impact of the
    production and trading of wine in different periods and
    regions; Michael Decker's paper focussed on the wine trade of
    Cilicia in Late Antiquity; Lukas Schachner investigated the
    evidence for wine production in the early monasteries of Egypt
    and the Levant; and Souad Slim took the conference forward to
    eighteenth and nineteenth-century viticulture on <hi rend="italic">waqf</hi>
    land in Lebanon.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P5"/>[5] A
    cluster of four papers related to wine and its use in the
    Aramaic city states of Late Antiquity. Lucinda Dirven started
    with images of banquet scenes from Hatra, and went on to argue
    that many were associated with local veneration of the
    ancestors which gave rise to an influential and widespread
    funerary cult, as part of which memorial banquets were held on
    key anniversaries not at the burial sites, as has previously
    been argued, but in the city's numerous temples. She also
    traced Heracles' supplanting of Nergal as god of the
    underworld. Danila Piacentini examined comparable evidence for
    the role of alcohol in the funeral ceremony and subsequent
    anniversary commemorations at Palmyra. The final two papers in
    this group neatly illustrated the difficulties involved in
    interpreting archaeological evidence for ancient religious
    practice and taboos. Joseph Patrich re-examined the evidence
    for Nabataean veneration of Dionysus, who was identified with
    the native Nabataean deity Dushara. Dushara is explicitly
    stated in one inscription to forbid the consumption of wine,
    and the absence of vine or grape motifs in the carved
    decoration of the monuments in Petra is quite remarkable. The
    obvious implication is that the Nabataean religion forbad the
    drinking of wine, and that Dionysus was worshipped not in that
    aspect associated with vegetation and wine, the aspect most
    familiar to many of us, but in his role as god of death and the
    afterlife. Zeyad al-Salameen, however, then presented an
    account of excavations at a site (Beyda) a short distance away
    from Petra where several contemporary wine presses had been
    found in association with caves where wine might well have been
    stored, and in one of which there was an inscription with an
    imprecation addressed to Dushara. This strongly suggests that
    Nabataeans were in fact both drinking and producing wine. How
    are we to reconcile the two sets of evidence? Was the community
    at Beyda prepared to overlook orthodox religious duty in favour
    of economic gain? Or had Hellenism weakened this particular
    demand of their religion? Or does some of the evidence need to
    be re-examined or redated? Perhaps we shall learn the
    resolution of this issue at a future Aram conference.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P6"/>[6] Three
    papers related to alcohol in Syriac sources. Shafiq AbouZayd
    explored the evidence for the strict prohibition of the
    drinking of alcohol in Syriac ascetic sources, and discussed
    some of the possible explanations for its origins. Sebastian
    Brock focussed on the spiritual theme of 'sober drunkenness'
    which can be traced back to Philo and is also to be found in
    the Macarian Homilies, and which frequently occurs in Syriac
    writings in the form 'spiritual drunkenness'. This concept was
    then followed with abundant examples as it evolved and
    developed in Syriac spiritual and liturgical texts, and its
    relationship to later Arabic Sufi texts was also suggested. An
    example of Arabic literary influence upon Syriac, in the form
    of the <hi rend="italic">khamriyyat</hi> or wine songs of Khamis bar Qardahe
    was discussed by David Taylor, who attempted to show how the
    conventional motifs of the desire of the poet for the virgin
    wine and the homoerotic longing for the cup-bearer were
    redirected towards Christ, both wine and cup-bearer. It was
    suggested that a probable context for these poems was the court
    of the Mongol Il-Khanate at the end of the thirteenth
    century.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P7"/>[7] The
    <hi rend="italic">khamriyya</hi> genre in its Islamic context formed the
    subject matter of Kathryn Kueny's paper, which focussed on a
    poem of the early-thirteenth-century Cairene poet Umar ibn
    al-Farid. This was a scintillating exploration of the literary
    and religious tensions involved in a Muslim poet who has never
    drunk wine, or who cannot admit to having done so, describing
    the intoxication induced by the divine fragrance which brings
    clarity of mind and an appreciation of what is real, a
    drunkenness which restores the soul to the state of its
    pre-existence. Another medieval Arabic text—an amusing
    account of a man who falls unconscious through drink, is joined
    by his friends who do likewise, and on his awaking he decides
    to rejoin them, and so on, so that over several days of sharing
    the same room they never actually meet each other
    awake—was chosen by Bo Holmberg as the focus for a
    fascinating examination of the longing for unconsciousness in
    the light of modern psychological theory. The final paper on
    alcohol in Arabic sources was Stephan Dähne's discussion
    of an early-eighteenth-century Christian-Arabic sermon against
    the sin of drunkenness produced by a European missionary in the
    Lebanon. Amongst several memorable features was its claim that
    humans began to drink wine after the flood because the water
    had been contaminated by the corpses of those drowned!</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P8"/>[8] In this
    report I have inevitably passed over much of great interest,
    and have no doubt garbled the arguments of some of the papers I
    have discussed, but the full texts should be available in due
    course within the pages of the Aram Periodical. To finish I
    would like again to raise my glass to Shafiq AbouZayd who has
    organised, with the invaluable aid of Hannah Hunt, another
    highly memorable conference in which scholars from all of the
    countries of the Middle East and beyond were able to meet and
    discuss issues of mutual interest and concern in a friendly and
    highly sociable context, regardless of world events. Your very
    good health Shafiq, and best wishes for the next twenty
    conferences!</p>

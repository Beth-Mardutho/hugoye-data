    opportunity to reflect briefly on the work of Syriacists who
    have died during these last ten years. Their contributions to
    the field of Syriac studies are considered under separate
    subject headings.</p>

    <hi rend="italic">Hugoye�s</hi> tenth anniversary offers the opportunity to
    reflect briefly on the past, <ref target="#FN1">1</ref> as well as to look to the future.
    In the course of these last ten years Syriac studies have lost
    a number of fine workers in the field, and it is appropriate
    here to recall some of their contributions in different areas
    within Syriac studies as a whole. The selection of names, and
    in particular of works, mentioned below is certainly not
    intended to be exhaustive, though I hope that no important
    scholar in this field has been overlooked. Where bibliographies
    of particular scholars are available, these are indicated in
    the notes. Otherwise, further bibliographical information can
    for the most part be found in my <hi rend="italic">Syriac Studies</hi>: <hi rend="italic">a
    Classified Bibliography</hi> (<hi rend="italic">1960-1990</hi>) (Kaslik,
    1996), and continued in <hi rend="italic">Parole de l�Orient</hi> 23 (1998)
    and 29 (2004); a further one, covering 2001-2005, is in
    preparation for <hi rend="italic">Parole de l�Orient</hi> 32 (2007).</p>
         <head xml:id="S1">The Syriac Biblical Versions</head>
         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P2"/>[2] Several
    patriarchs during the past century of the various Syriac
    Churches have been notable Syriac scholars; the most recent of
    them was the late Patriarch of the Chaldean Catholic Church,
    Mar Raphael Bidawid (1922-2003)<ref target="#FN2">2</ref>. In the field of biblical
    studies he was the editor of the Syriac version of 4 Esdras
    (Apocalypse of Esdras), preserved complete only in the famous
    Milan Peshitta manuscript (7a1); this was published� in one of
    the earliest volumes of the Leiden <hi rend="italic">Vetus Testamentum
    Syriace</hi> (IV.3;�1973).</p>
         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P3"/>[3] Michael
    Weitzman (1946-1998) was someone whose profound scholarship and
    innovative approach to the origins of the Peshitta Old
    Testament is evident on every page of his <hi rend="italic">The Syriac
    Version of the Old Testament.�An Introduction</hi>, published
    posthumously.<ref target="#FN3">3</ref> Modestly described as just �An Introduction�,
    this is an Introduction on the scale of H.B. Swete�s <hi rend="italic">An
    Introduction to the Old Testament in Greek</hi> (1900,
    2<hi rend="sup">nd</hi> edn 1914), albeit of a very different character;
    just as Swete�s work is still invaluable a century later for
    certain types of information, so too it is likely that
    Weitzman�s <hi rend="italic">Introduction</hi> will continue to be read and
    consulted with profit for many years to come.�Besides editing a
    volume of essays in his memory,<ref target="#FN4">4</ref> his colleagues at University
    College, London, Ada Rapapport-Albert and Gillian Greenberg
    very usefully collected together his various articles into a
    volume entitled <hi rend="italic">From Judaism to Christianity,<ref target="#FN5">5</ref>
            </hi> after the
    title of his influential contribution of 1992, which opens the
    volume.</p>
         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P4"/>[4] Although
    Michael Weitzman was in close contact with the Peshitta
    Institute (Leiden) he was never directly involved in the
    edition of the <hi rend="italic">Vetus Testamentum Syriace</hi> (VTS).
    Another scholar, David Lane (1935-2005),<ref target="#FN6">6</ref> however, was closely
    involved with the work of the Institute over many years, in
    particular editing Qoheleth and (with J.A. Emerton) Wisdom and
    the Song of Songs, all in VTS II.5 (1979),�and later, Leviticus
    (in VTS I.2, 1991). Besides a number of different articles on
    the Peshitta of these books, he also produced an important
    monograph, <hi rend="italic">The Peshitta of Leviticus,<ref target="#FN7">7</ref>
            </hi> at the end of
    which he offers an interesting theory concerning the origin of
    the standard medieval text of the Peshitta Old Testament.</p>
         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P5"/>[5] Among
    the various publications in the field of Syriac studies, J.P.M.
    van der Ploeg (1909-2004)<ref target="#FN8">8</ref> contributed a worthwhile article on
    the Peshitta Old Testament in general<ref target="#FN9">9</ref>, and an edition of a hitherto
    unknown Syriac version of the Book of Judith.<ref target="#FN10">10</ref>
         </p>
         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P6"/>[6] Anyone
    who has an interest in the Diatessaron will especially be
    grateful to William (Bill) L. Petersen (1950 - December 2006)
    whose many contributions on problems surrounding the
    Diatessaron culminated in his <hi rend="italic">Tatian's Diatessaron. Its
    Creation, Dissemination, Significance, and History in
    Scholarship</hi>
            <ref target="#FN11">11</ref>, which constitutes a truly masterly guide
    to the complex problems surrounding this famous harmony of the
    Four Gospels. Petersen had studied under another great
    Diatessaron scholar who had died earlier this year, Gilles
    Quispel (1916-2006), whose many stimulating contributions every
    now and then also touched on things Syriac.</p>
         <head xml:id="S2">Syriac Literature</head>
         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P7"/>[7] The
    study of early Syriac literature and the emergence of
    Christianity in Edessa owes a great deal to Han J. W. Drijvers
    (1934-2002).<ref target="#FN12">12</ref> His monograph on Bardaisan�s teaching remains
    a standard work on the subject, forty years on. His many
    incisive articles on the Odes of Solomon, the Acts of Thomas
    and the character of early Syriac Christianity need to be taken
    into account by anyone working in that area, even though some
    of his views (such as his third-century dating of the Odes of
    Solomon and his emphasis on the solely Greek background of
    second- and third- century Syriac Christianity) are open to
    dispute. Many of his articles in the Syriac field are
    conveniently collected in the first of his two volumes in the
    Variorum Reprints,<ref target="#FN13">13</ref> 
            <hi rend="italic">East of Antioch.� Studies in Early
    Syriac Christianity</hi> (London, 1984). Among his last
    publications in the Syriac field was a photographic edition,
    with a study done in conjunction with his son Jan Willem, of a
    very early Syriac text on the Finding of the Cross.<ref target="#FN14">14</ref>

            <anchor xml:id="P8"/>[8]
    Considerable interest has been shown in recent years in the
    links between Ephrem and Jewish exegetical traditions. Here one
    of the most substantial contributions has been <hi rend="italic">Motifs from
    Genesis 1-11 in the Genuine Hymns of Ephrem the
    Syrian</hi>,<ref target="#FN15">15</ref> by Tryggve Kronholm (1939-1999), whose
    subtitle specifies �with particular reference to the influence
    of Jewish exegetical tradition�. He subsequently followed this
    up with worthwhile articles on Ephrem�s treatment of Abraham
    and of Judah and Tamar (Gen. 38).<ref target="#FN16">16</ref>
         </p>
         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P9"/>[9] Possible
    links in a different direction, between Ephrem and the Greek
    poet Romanos, were the topic of Bill Petersen's stimulating
    <hi rend="italic">The Diatessaron and Ephrem Syrus as Sources of Romanos the
    Melodist</hi>.<ref target="#FN17">17</ref> Even though Petersen may have sometimes
    overstated his case for the influence of Ephrem on Romanos,
    nevertheless he did a great service in drawing attention to the
    serious possibility that Romanos, who came from Homs, could
    have made use (and indeed probably did) of literary sources in
    Syriac, as well as in Greek.</p>
         <p rend="nn">
            <anchor xml:id="P10"/>[10] What
    is still the only book-length study, from the point of view of
    literary history,�of the Persian martyrdoms was produced by
    Gernot Wiessner (1933-1999), in his <hi rend="italic">Untersuchungen zur
    syrischen Literaturgeschichte I.�Zur M�rtyrer�berlieferung aus
    der Christenverfolgung Schapurs II.<ref target="#FN18">18</ref>
            </hi>

         <p rend="nn">
            <anchor xml:id="P11"/>[11] For
    Syriacists the name of Antoine Guillaumont (1915-2000) is
    primarily associated with Evagrius and his discovery, followed
    by edition, of the lost �uncensored� version of Evagrius�s
    Centuries on (Spiritual) Knowledge.<ref target="#FN19">19</ref> After publishing the text
    of the two forms of the Syriac text, Guillaumont set out the
    significance of this work in both the Greek and Syriac
    traditions in a masterly monograph, <hi rend="italic">Les Kephalaia Gnostica
    d��vagre le Pontique et l�histoire de l�orig�nisme chez les
    Grecs et chez les Syriens</hi> (Paris, 1962). Although he did
    not edit any further Syriac translations of Evagrius, he
    provided a great deal of information about their manuscript
    tradition in the introductions to his editions of the Greek
    texts of the <hi rend="italic">Praktikos</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Gnostikos</hi> in
    Sources chr�tiennes, as well as in various articles.
    Guillaumont also wrote very illuminatingly on the early Syriac
    ascetic traditions, and several of his articles in this area
    are to be found collected in <hi rend="italic">Aux origines du monachisme
    chr�tien</hi> (Spiritualit� orientale 30, 1979).<ref target="#FN20">20</ref>

         <p rend="nn">
            <anchor xml:id="P12"/>[12]
    Syriac studies owe a very great debt to Fran�ois Graffin
    (1905-2002),<ref target="#FN21">21</ref> the self-effacing editor for over half a
    century<ref target="#FN22">22</ref> of Patrologia Orientalis [PO] (which had been
    founded in 1903 by his uncle, Ren� Graffin, 1858-1941). In this
    series he brought to completion the editions, left uncompleted
    at his death by M. Bri�re, of Severus� 125 Cathedral Homilies
    and of Philoxenus� <hi rend="italic">Mimre</hi> against Habib - both major
    undertakings.�� He also edited the third �Base� of Bar
    <hi rend="sup">
               <hi rend="italic">c</hi>
            </hi>Ebroyo�s <hi rend="italic">Mnorat Qudshe</hi> (PO 27.4;
    1957), a collection of sixth-century anonymous homilies (PO
    41.4; 1984), and (with P. Harb and M. Albert) the Letter on the
    three stages of the monastic life, correctly ascribed to Joseph
    Hazzaya (it had previously been attributed to Philoxenus). A
    bibliography, but only to 1976, of his many other publications
    in the Syriac field can be found in <hi rend="italic">M�langes offerts au
    R.P. Fran�ois Graffin = Parole de l�Orient</hi> 6/7 (1975/6),
    pp. xi-xvi. It might be noted that he was the author of a
    number of very useful articles on Syriac writers in the
    excellent <hi rend="italic">Dictionnaire de Spiritualit�.</hi>
         </p>
         <p rend="nn">
            <anchor xml:id="P13"/>[13] A
    scholar of great ability, but who sadly published very little,
    was Jost G. Blum (1944-2002): trained in Germanistik, he was
    able to bring a highly sophisticated approach to the study of
    Syriac literature, the only published example of which is his
    innovative article �Zum Bau von Abschnitten in Memre von Jakob
    von Sarug�, in the proceedings of the Third Symposium
    Syriacum.<ref target="#FN23">23</ref> Before he turned, in later years, to the study
    of Yiddish he was working on a catalogue of the Syriac
    manuscripts and early printed books in the Bavarian
    Staatsbibliothek in Munich; unfortunately the money supporting
    this important enterprise ran out before he was able to
    complete the work.</p>
         <p rend="nn">
            <anchor xml:id="P14"/>[14] The
    death of Yusuf Habbi (1938-2000), in a car crash on the road
    between Baghdad and Amman, was a tragic loss above all for the
    Chaldean Church in Iraq, in which he was a leading intellectual
    figure and very active in promoting Syriac studies in the
    Syriac Section of the Iraqi Academy and higher education in
    general at Babel College, in Baghdad.<ref target="#FN24">24</ref> Naturally, many
    of his publications in the Syriac field are in Arabic, and here
    mention might just be made of his many contributions to the
    Proceedings of the Iraqi Academy�s Syriac section, and his
    re-editions of the short Syriac Chronicles (Baghdad, 1983), and
    of Abdisho�s poem on Syriac writers (Baghdad, 1986). In
    European publications Habbi was a frequent contributor to
    journals on Canon Law and to the series of Italian volumes
    devoted to the Classical heritage in Middle Eastern
    literatures, where his papers dealt both with more general
    questions of transmission and with particular genres.<ref target="#FN25">25</ref>

    Anyone who has an interest in Timothy I, Catholicos of the

    David Lane�s edition of the early seventh-century East Syriac

    after his death (even though they bear the date 2004).</p>

    Albert van Roey (1915-2000) was an experienced editor of many
    difficult Syriac theological texts of the sixth to ninth
    centuries; in many cases his editions were accompanied by Latin
    translations, seeing that Latin is much better than most modern
    languages at reproducing the feel of the Syriac. Among his
    publications of Syriac texts that appeared in book form are
    <hi rend="italic">Nonnus de Nisibe. Trait� apolog�tique</hi> (Louvain, 1948),
    <hi rend="italic">Eliae Epistula Apologetica ad Leonem, Syncellum

    Gregory the Illuminator,<ref target="#FN32">32</ref> the Syriac version of which plays
    a significant part in the very complex literary history
    surrounding this work. Other Syriac texts of no small
    significance that he edited include the Panegyric on another
    Gregory, the Wonderworker, by yet a third Gregory, of Nyssa,
    and the Syriac Acts of Andrew, attributed (no doubt falsely) to
    Ephrem.<ref target="#FN33">33</ref> It might also be noted that he was the author

    Although a few early Syriac inscriptions had been published in

    Segal who paved the way, by means of a series of articles
    publishing new texts that he himself had discovered in the

    Western Syriac traditions, <hi rend="italic">Sakramententheologie bei den

            <ref target="#FN39">39</ref> Although these works were

    of the great names in this history of scholarship on Eastern
    liturgy is Juan Mateos (1917-2003). Although he is best known
    for his work on the Byzantine liturgical tradition, he also did
    work of fundamental importance on Syriac liturgy. His monograph
    <hi rend="italic">Lelya</hi>-<hi rend="italic">Sapra: Essai d�interpr�tation des matines
    chald�ennes</hi> (Orientalia Christiana Analecta 156, 1959) is
    a magisterial study based on an intimate knowledge both of the
    living tradition and of the source materials. His many articles
    on both East and West Syriac liturgical tradition are essential
    reading for anyone with a serious interest in Syriac
    liturgy.<ref target="#FN41">41</ref>

         <p rend="nn">
            <anchor xml:id="P29"/>[29]
    Whereas Mateos worked with the primary sources, I-H. Dalmais
    (1914-2006) was a very different sort of liturgical scholar,
    his gift being primarily one of haute vulgarisation, based on a
    very wide knowledge of all the Eastern liturgical
    traditions.�His many articles on different aspects of Syriac
    liturgy perform a good service in making them better known to a
    wider public.</p>
         <p rend="nn">
            <anchor xml:id="P30"/>[30] Not
    surprisingly, among Mar Julius �i�ek�s numerous text editions
    are many liturgical texts. Needless to say, these are primarily
    for practical use, but quite a number of them should also be of
    interest to liturgical scholars, since they provide texts of
    services not otherwise available in print. Thus, for example,
    his <hi rend="italic">Anafura</hi> (1985) provides ten anaphoras, several of
    which are not easily accessible, or indeed sometimes not
    otherwise available at all in print.<ref target="#FN42">42</ref> Also of
    particular importance in this respect are his editions of the
    <hi rend="italic">Shebitho</hi> (1993) and <hi rend="italic">Beth Gazo Rabo</hi> (1992).
    His Gospel Lectionary (1987), reproduced from his own beautiful
    handwriting and accompanied by reproductions of
    thirteenth-century illuminated manuscripts in Tur Abdin, stands
    out as almost certainly the finest example of his
    calligraphy.</p>

    Francis Acharya (Fran�ois Mahieu; 1912-2002),<ref target="#FN43">43</ref> Superior of
    Kurisumala Ashram in Kerala, undertook the large task of making
    an adapted English translation, for practical monastic use, of
    the main parts of the Syrian Catholic Fenqitho, published in
    Mosul (1886-96) in seven volumes. This appeared under the title
    <hi rend="italic">The Crown of the Year</hi> I-III (1982-1986), which formed
    vols. II-IV of his <hi rend="italic">Prayer with the Harp of the Spirit</hi>,
    the first volume of which was an adapted translation of the
    <hi rend="italic">She<hi rend="u">h</hi>imo,</hi> or Weekday Office
    (1982).<ref target="#FN44">44</ref> Though this is not, of course, an academic
    publication, Fr. Francis nevetheless had a good knowledge of
    Syriac and, in particular, a sensitive feeling for the Syriac
    liturgical tradition; as a result he was able to produce a very
    successful example of liturgical aggiornamento which deserves
    to be followed elsewhere too. Among his last works was a
    translation of, and commentary on, the West Syriac Ritual of
    the Clothing of Monks.<ref target="#FN45">45</ref>

    of the most significant events in the history of Syriac

    J.B. Segal�s <hi rend="italic">Edessa</hi>, �<hi rend="italic">the Blessed City�</hi>
    (Oxford, 1970; repr. Piscataway NJ, 2005), subsequently
    translated into both Turkish and Arabic. This work, along with
    Robert Murray�s <hi rend="italic">Symbols of Church and Kingdom</hi> (1975),
    could be said to have provided the main impetus and inspiration
    for the revival of interest in Syriac studies that the last
    three decades or so have witnessed. Segal�s knowledge of the
    Syriac sources for the history of Edessa (which he takes down
    to 1144) was unrivalled, as was his ability to weave them
    together into a highly readable narrative history. Though
    academic readers will find his deliberate avoidance of
    footnotes giving precise sources somewhat frustrating, it was
    probably this very feature that has ensured the book�s wide
    circulation. Segal also produced several very valuable articles
    on aspects of history based on Syriac sources, notably
    �Mesopotamian communities from Julian to the rise of Islam� and
    �Arabs in Syriac literature before the rise of Islam�.<ref target="#FN46">46</ref>

    his articles on Oriental Patriarchates and on the fifth-century

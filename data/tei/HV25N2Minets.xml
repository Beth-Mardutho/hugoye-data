                <p xml:lang="en">This article contributes to the discussion on the primordial
                    language in the late antique Syriac tradition, specifically in the legacy of
                    Ephrem the Syrian (c.306–373). The important milestone is the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Cave of Treasures</hi>, a pseudepigraphal historical narrative ascribed to
                    Ephrem but dated to the mid-sixth or early seventh century. The text
                    emphatically asserts the priority of Syriac over Hebrew. The idea would later
                    become popular among both Eastern and Western Syriac intellectuals. Some
                    scholars have taken it as a testimony of Ephrem’s views or an indication that
                    these ideas had been in circulation in his time. However, the authentic writings
                    of Ephrem the Syrian are surprisingly equivocal concerning the pre-Babel
                    language. We can partially reconstruct his views by collating the bits of
                    information from indirect statements in his hymns and his Commentary on Genesis.
                    Analyzing Ephrem’s discussion on the tower of Babel and language confusion helps
                    rectify the assumption that Ephrem championed Syriac primordiality.</p>

                    narrative dated to the mid-sixth or the early seventh century, declared that
                    Syriac was humanity’s primordial language before Babel’s confusion of tongues
                    that started the process of linguistic diversification. Its author emphatically
                    stated that those who disagreed with such a view were wrong: “From Adam until
                    this time [Babel], they [people] were all of one speech and one language. They
                    all spoke this language, this is to say, Syriac, which is Aramaic, and this
                    language is the king of all languages. Now ancient writers have erred in that
                    they said that Hebrew was the first, and in this matter they have mingled an
                    ignorant mistake with their writing.” The narrator concludes that “all the
                    languages there are in the world are derived from Syriac, and all the languages
                    in books are mingled with it.”<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn1" n="1"><p

                    ascribed it to Ephrem the Syrian in what seems to be a deliberate
                    pseudepigraphic strategy – i.e., using Ephrem’s name was “an essential element
                    of its actual author’s literary and ideological agenda”<note place="foot"

                    this attribution is attested in the majority of Syriac manuscripts and has
                    generated a robust tradition. Therefore, some scholars have taken the discussion
                    of Syriac primordiality in this composition as a testimony of Ephrem’s views or
                    as an indication that these ideas circulated in the Syriac milieu since his
                    time. The possibility of the earlier date for the composition suggested
                    previously in scholarship became a much-cited argument. E. A. Wallis Budge, the
                    author of the English translation of the <hi rend="italic">Cave of
                        Treasures</hi>, published in 1927 and based on a single manuscript from the
                    British Museum (Ms. Add. 25875, representing the so-called Eastern recension),
                    noted that even though “it is now generally believed that the form in which we
                    now have it is not older than the VIth century”<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn6"
                        n="6"><p rend="footnote text">

                    great fourth-century Syriac poet is wrong, “if not written by Ephrem himself,
                    one of his disciples, or some member of his school, may have been the author of
                    the book.”<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn7" n="7"><p rend="footnote text">

                    fourth-century Ephremian connections for the original core of the composition,
                    while the present text took shape in the sixth century or later. The assumptions
                    of the wide chronological range for the date of the composition – the fourth to
                    the sixth century – still occasionally surface in the scholarship, often citing

                    Ephrem the Syrian as a founding figure of the entire Syriac exegetical

                    and asserted this status for the Syriac language. Eskhult’s views are primarily
                    based on the attribution of the <hi rend="italic">Cave of Treasures</hi> to
                    Ephrem shared by “almost all manuscripts” and the fact that the work prioritizes
                    Syriac so emphatically.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn10" n="10"><p xml:lang="en"

                    undefined circle of “his Syrian successors.” He acknowledges, however, that the

                        rend="italic">Commentary on Genesis</hi> “leaves the question open.” The <hi
                        rend="italic">Commentary</hi> mentions that, at Babel, all people “lost
                    their original language, which was lost by all the nations, with one
                        exception.”<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn11" n="11"><p rend="footnote text">

                    the Syrian and Theodore of Mopsuestia, Syriac writers are almost unanimous in
                    their claim that Syriac was the primordial language” and that this position “is

                <p xml:lang="en">By contrast, Sergey Minov asserts that “nowhere in his authentic
                    writings does Ephrem promote the idea of Syriac as the primeval language.”

                        Genesis </hi>about this enigmatic single nation – the Hebrews or the
                    Syrians? – that preserved the primordial tongue, he argues that “in the
                    fourth-century intellectual context, where Hebrew was the only attested
                    candidate in discussions on the primeval language, such an ambiguous statement
                    should almost certainly be understood as relating to this language and not, for

                    the scholarly tendency to downplay the significance of the idea of Hebrew

                    the post-seventh-century statements of Syriac priority back into the earlier
                    periods: “In fact, the only Syriac writer to affirm the primacy of the Syriac
                    language during this period is the author of [the <hi rend="italic">Cave of

                <p xml:lang="en">I share Minov’s conviction that most likely Ephrem has nothing to
                    do with the idea of Syriac primordiality ascribed to him later. Yet, the
                    tendency to attribute these views to Ephrem or his disciples, attested among
                    some scholars, shows that a detailed analysis of relevant passages in Ephrem’s
                    corpus about the primordial tongue remains a <hi rend="italic">desideratum</hi>.
                    Thus the present article aims to read Ephrem closely, contextualize his ideas in
                    a broader intellectual landscape of the fourth century, and explore any certain,
                    uncertain, and undoubtedly ambiguous testimonies of what he may have thought
                    about the primordial language. I hope that the deep dive into Ephrem’s
                    discussion on the tower of Babel and the confusion of languages will clear up
                    the persistent misconception that Ephrem can be taken for granted as a champion
                    of Syriac primordiality.</p>

                <p xml:lang="en">Ephrem did not refer to the Babel confusion of tongues specifically
                    here. His primary argument is against various stripes of magicians, fortune
                    tellers, and astrologers. However, by extension, the description implies that
                    God’s intervention at Babel was a careful and premeditated process as well,
                    rather than an act of mixing up languages “as if without the order.” The fact
                    that Genesis 11:1–9 could be read and was read in this way in the Syriac milieu
                    is evident, for example, from Jacob of Sarug’s homily <hi rend="italic">On the

                    names may provide an additional clue for the discussion because it helps locate
                    Ephrem in his contemporary cultural context. As far as we know, in his extant
                    works, Ephrem never mentioned Aram, who, according to the table of nations in
                    Genesis 10, was a son of Shem and a grandson of Noah and whose name was often
                    taken as an eponym for the Aramaic language and people. Ephrem, however,
                    occasionally referred to “Arameans” (<foreign xml:lang="syr"

                    those we would call “Syriac speakers,” but it gradually acquired a range of
                    meanings beyond simply a designation of the ethnic group. With the increasing
                    Christianization and Hellenization of the region, Syriac-speaking Christians
                    chose to describe themselves as “Syrians,” while the term “Arameans” started to
                    function as a Syriac equivalent of Greek <foreign xml:lang="gr"

                    significance of this statement becomes apparent if we take into account the
                    wider late antique polemics about who – Heber (Genesis 10:21-25 and 11:14-16) or
                    Abraham <hi rend="italic">ha-ʿibri</hi> (Genesis 14:13) – was instrumental in
                    preserving the original tongue and after whom the language and the people were
                    named “Hebrew.” This issue became a focal point of Jewish–Christian cultural
                    debate and contributed to consolidating their corresponding religious
                    identities. The basic meaning of Abraham’s appellation <hi rend="italic"
                        >ha-ʿibri</hi> in Genesis 14:13 is “traveler,” “emigrant,” or “one who
                    crossed something.” Abraham was so-called since he came from native Chaldea to
                    the foreign land of Palestine, crossing the Euphrates river. The appellation was
                    also taken as the first attestation of the ethnonym “Hebrew.” Generally
                    speaking, those Christians who accessed the biblical text via the Septuagint
                    preferred the Heber eponymy because it was prompted by its rendering of the
                    passage Genesis 14:13 as “Abraham the traveler” (περατής) and not “Abraham the

                            Alexander Polyhistor of Miletus (first century BCE) and Claudius Charax
                            of Pergamon (second century CE), can be explained by their access to
                            sources informed about the Hebrew reading of Genesis 14:13. Alexander
                            Polyhistor referred to a certain Artapanus, who was probably a Jewish

                <p xml:lang="en">Ephrem made another exciting move here. He drew parallels between
                    the Babelites of old and “the Evil One” of his days, babbling with confused
                    tongues. At first, “the Evil One” seems to allude to the devil. But the
                    subsequent zooming in on such specifics as “in our day” and “in the Church
                    instead of Babel” implies a certain unnamed human actor or actors. However,
                    Ephrem’s poetic language is more likely to encompass all those meanings. “The
                    Evil One” of the cosmic drama still speaks through the contemporary leaders of
                    heterodox opinions, according to Ephrem. The take-away point for our discussion
                    about the primordial language is that the increasing importance of the line
                    Genesis 11:7 in the context of the Trinitarian polemics drew away one’s
                    attention from the historical reading of the passage. The overwhelming focus on
                    theological underpinnings eclipses the potential opportunities for linguistic
                    speculations. </p>
                <p xml:lang="en">We see the same tendency among fourth-century Greek writers. Very
                    few voices pondered the primordial language in the period between Eusebius and
                    Chrysostom, probably because prominent Greek theologians of the time, such as
                    Basil of Caesarea and Gregory of Nyssa, were engaged in anti-Eunomian polemics.
                    As a result, they took a very different stand on languages and linguistics.<note

                    other things, this eventually brought Gregory to reject Hebrew primordiality

                    a judgment concerning the identity of the first language because of a lack of

                    According to Gregory, Hebrew was just one out of many other ethnic tongues and a
                    relatively recent invention: “Some of those who have studied the divine
                    scriptures most carefully say that the Hebrew language is not even ancient in
                    the way that the others are, but that... this language was suddenly improvised

                    Gregory repeated an argument employed by several Hellenistic critics of Judaism
                    and early Christianity. He referred to Psalm 80.6, “When they went forth from
                    the land of Egypt, he heard a language that he did not know,” as biblical proof
                    that Hebrew emerged during the Israelites’ exodus from Egypt.<note place="foot"

                    inquiries and empty curiosity. There is one significant difference, though,
                    between him and Gregory. As seen in his <hi rend="italic">Commentary on
                        Genesis</hi>, Ephrem asserted that one (unnamed) nation preserved the
                    original tongue after the confusion at Babel, while Gregory did not seem to
                    entertain such an option.</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">A few words need to be said about the first stanza in the quoted
                    passage. It presents a poetical and etymological exercise that may be
                    potentially helpful for discussing the identity of the primordial language.
                    Ephrem alludes to the names (<foreign xml:lang="syr">ܟܘܢܝ̈ܐ</foreign> or
                        <foreign xml:lang="syr">ܫܡܗ̈ܐ</foreign>) and their correspondence to the
                    things they describe. He encourages readers to rejoice, “quiet the disorder,”
                    and “receive in order” divine names. The controversy about the divine names fits
                    the stage of the Trinitarian debates in the 360s. Ancient discussions about the
                    correctness of names went back to Plato and his famous dialogue <hi

                    language that can demonstrate the correspondence between words and the essence
                    of the things they describe is ultimately “correct.” In the Judeo-Christian
                    context, such a language would be the most likely candidate for primordial
                    status. The discussions routinely evolved around etymological and
                    pseudo-etymological arguments. Ephrem’s text highlights the parallels between
                        <foreign xml:lang="syr">ܐܕܡܬܐ</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="syr"
                        >ܐܕܡ</foreign> (earth and Adam), <foreign xml:lang="syr">ܚܘܐ</foreign> and

                        xml:lang="syr">ܦܠܓ</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="syr">ܦܘܠܓܐ</foreign>
                    (Peleg and division), <foreign xml:lang="syr">ܒܒܠ</foreign> and <foreign
                        xml:lang="syr">ܒܘܠܒܠܐ</foreign> (Babel and confusion). These parallels work
                    reasonably well for his Syriac.</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">Such etymological inquiries in biblical names were common among
                    rabbinic and Christian scholars who argued in favor of Hebrew’s primordiality.

                    pointed out the linguistic correspondence between the Hebrew words for man (<hi

                    idioms. This reasoning of Rabbinic scholars was taken up by Christian writers,
                    such as Eusebius of Emesa (c.300–359), who referred to precisely the same

                    outcome was a bit unusual. Theodoret argued that these etymologies work best for

                    The etymological connection between the pairs of biblical words he mentioned

                    Hebrew and the speculative character of ancient etymologies, the very attempt to
                    derive the biblical names solely from Syriac to the exclusion of Hebrew is

                <p xml:lang="en">The reference to the biblical Babel functions as an underlying
                    metaphor for this stanza. The confusion of tongues in Babel becomes an ultimate
                    archetype of all confusion, past and present. Similarly to the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Hymns on Faith</hi> passage analyzed above, Ephrem compares those who were
                    “confused” in his time – fortune tellers, astrologers, wizards, and various
                    kinds of heretics – to “the confused sons of Babel,” whose languages were
                    confused. Interestingly enough, Ephrem speaks about their “languages” in the
                    plural and is not concerned with the single primordial tongue prior to the
                    event. Although the image of Babel as the place of confusion is central in this
                    stanza of the hymn, it is not especially helpful for discussing the identity of
                    the pre-Babel language in Ephrem.</p>

                    the Babel confusion is unavoidably a story about disruption, failure, and
                    disaster. One can blame the devil, human sinfulness, or their passions, hubris,
                    and disobedience, but the overall picture is bleak. It was common for early
                    Christian writers to use Babel as a <hi rend="italic">typos</hi> for any

                    that the many built” as a symbol of “the One...[who] went down and built on the
                    earth the tower that reached the heaven.”<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn65"

                <p xml:lang="en">Interestingly enough, Ephrem skipped mentioning the linguistic
                    phenomena that accompanied the building of the tower and the eventual
                    abandonment of the construction. Instead, he explored the opportunities that the
                    image of a single and magnificent structure offers as a metaphor (<hi

                    for Christ and his Gospel. The identity of the primordial language is not of

                <p xml:lang="en">However, two lines later, Ephrem mentioned that “in the days of
                    Peleg, the earth was divided into seventy tongues; this anticipated the One who
                    divided the earth for his apostles through the tongues.”<note place="foot"

                        82:6).</p></note> The verse linked the Babel confusion of tongues to the
                    Pentecost event when the fiery tongues of the Spirit endowed each of the
                    apostles with the ability to speak in different languages. Thus, languages were
                    divided among the apostles, similarly to the division of the languages at Babel
                    – the <hi rend="italic">typos</hi> that anticipated the Pentecostal miracle.</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">Ephrem explores the same imagery and typology elsewhere in his
                    works. In one of the <hi rend="italic">Hymns on Virginity</hi>, he also
                    mentioned that the earth was divided into seventy languages at Babel. This
                    division foreshadowed another division of the earth among the apostles through
                    the tongues. Ephrem’s <hi rend="italic">Hymns on Virginity</hi> is a
                    heterogeneous collection composed of several smaller cycles, each united by a
                    single theme and melody and several stand-alone hymns. Hymn 40, in which Ephrem
                    referred to Babel, is one of those individual poems. Its central themes are
                    praising the Lord, the people’s expectations for the Messiah in the past age,
                    and the current struggle against the faithless and disputers. The verses about
                    Babel are partially lost, and the best attempt to recover the texts yields the

                <p xml:lang="en">As far as we can judge, there is a tightly crafted polysemantic
                    system of images and their opposites – falsehood and truth; the Babelites, the
                    apostles, and the new disputants; the unity of faithful and scattering around of
                    sinners; the division of tongues at Babel and the one on the day of Pentecost;
                    the tower of harm and that of salvation. The rhetoric is aimed at the disputers
                    of the current age who behave in the same arrogant and senseless manner as the
                    old tower-builders at Babel. The “Most High” who punished sinful Babelites and
                    confused their tongues is also the one who endowed his disciples with the gift
                    of multiple languages. The truth that the apostles received became a promise of
                    the future salvation of those who separate themselves from the falsehood of
                    confusion and hostilities. In this complex typological network of signs and
                    symbols, the question of the identity of the pre-Babel language was outside
                    Ephrem’s exegetical framework. The image of Babel has potential for his
                    purposes, but its historical linguistic aspect is not his priority.</p>

                <p xml:lang="en">Ephrem built the dramatic contract by piling up the examples of
                    what had been done by the dissolute race of giants of ancient times, including
                    their well-deserved punishments and the eventual destruction, on the one hand,
                    and the continuing wrongdoings of the current generation, on the other hand. The
                    contrast is intensified to the highest degree because people of the present age
                    continue to behave senselessly, despite having the warning of the law, the
                    lessons of the past, and the promise of the future truth and submission. </p>
                <p xml:lang="en">The passage demonstrates Ephrem’s familiarity with Jewish and
                    Hellenistic apocryphal traditions commenting on Gen. 6:4, which tells of “the
                    mighty men of old” or giants, born from the marriage of “the sons of God” and
                    “the daughters of men.” In Gen. 10:8–9, Nimrod, who was later associated with
                    the tower’s construction, is named “a mighty one on the earth” and “a mighty
                    hunter.” The idea that there had been a certain pre-Babel race of giants was
                    attested in Greek historians of the Hellenistic and Roman era – in Abydenus’
                    now-lost <hi rend="italic">History of the Chaldeans </hi>(c. 200 BCE), which
                    probably was derived from the history by Berossus (c. 300 BCE, Babylon), and in
                    Alexander Polyhistor (first century BCE, Rome). In his <hi rend="italic"
                        >Chronicle</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Preparation for the Gospel</hi> 9.14
                    and 9.17, Eusebius of Caesarea cited the opinions of Abydenus and the earliest
                    Hellenistic Jewish historian Eupolemus that the giants built the tower of
                        Babel.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn75" n="75"><p rend="footnote text">

                    the tower of Babel and the confusion of tongues attested in Ephrem. The most

                        >Commentary on Genesis, </hi>where Ephrem presented it as the termination of
                    the original unilingualism and the beginning of linguistic diversity. He
                    emphasized that “the whole earth had a single language” and that Noah’s
                    grandchildren “received” their tongues at Babel before being scattered
                        worldwide.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn76" n="76"><p rend="footnote text">

                    Noah, speaking their respective languages. As Ephrem noted, all of them, with a
                    single exception, lost their shared primordial tongue. Who was this exception?
                    Ephrem did not point to Heber and his descendants directly. His story’s
                    primordial language remains nameless, turning into an invitation to further
                    speculative suggestions. It is as if Ephrem intentionally left such a playful
                    remark, meaning to puzzle scholars today.</p>

                    probably wrote it during the last decade of his life in Edessa, where he moved
                    after his native Nisibis was surrendered to the Persians. In Edessa, Ephrem
                    encountered a wildly diverse multireligious and multiconfessional community and

                    portions of the narrative are summarized or skipped over. It is the part to
                    which the story about the tower of Babel belongs. Since the socio-historical
                    implementations of the alleged starting point of linguistic diversity had little
                    importance for Ephrem’s opponents’ primeval history and mythological
                    constructions, he did not feel the need to address the passage polemically in
                    greater detail. Therefore, he only reported its content briefly. </p>
                <p xml:lang="en">Does this mean that Ephrem was outright not interested in languages
                    and communication? His works’ various metalinguistic remarks and comments
                    demonstrate that this is not the case. He typically attends to forms and modes
                    of expression and communication. He introduces metalinguistic remarks in his
                    descriptions of biblical events, even where the original scriptural passage
                    would not mention anything about languages. In the same <hi rend="italic"
                        >Commentary on Genesis,</hi> Ephrem narrated the story of Joseph’s brothers
                    who came to Egypt for food during the famine in Judea (Genesis 42). Joseph
                    concealed his true identity and acted as a high Egyptian official. According to
                    Ephrem, when Joseph accused his brothers of being spies, their rebuttals
                    involved language issues: “They answered and said, ‘We do not even know the
                    Egyptian language so that, by speaking Egyptian, we might escape notice and
                    deceive the Egyptians. That we dwell in the land of Canaan you can learn from
                    our offering... That we are completely ignorant of the Egyptian language and do
                    not wear the garb of Egyptians also testifies to our truthfulness.’”<note

                    responsible for mentioning the Egyptian language as an argument against the
                    allegation that the visitors were spies. It is his original addition to the flow
                    of the biblical story – logically plausible but lacking the direct scriptural

                    (Gen. 3:1). He considered four options: first, that “Adam knew the serpent’s own
                    language”; second, that “Satan spoke through [the serpent]”; third, that “the
                    serpent asked the question mentally, and speech was granted”; or fourth, “Satan
                    asked God that speech should temporarily be granted to the serpent.”<note

                    option Ephrem preferred, but the exceptional level of attention he paid to
                    linguistic codes and channels of communication is noteworthy. Ephrem
                    demonstrated a keen interest in tangible details and the very mechanics of
                    verbal interaction. </p>
                <p xml:lang="en">Similarly, we note unexpected remarks on languages in Ephrem’s
                    hymns and homilies on New Testament passages. He added, for instance, that when
                    Jesus healed the deaf and mute people (Mark 7.31-37) they “hear and speak
                    languages (plur.) they had never learned.” This was meant to anticipate the
                    apostolic speaking in every language.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn84" n="84"><p

                    love for typological interpretation, but it also reveals that the issue of
                    language was permanently present in his mind. Elsewhere, Ephrem presented Jesus
                    as a newborn baby and then a prisoner before Herod (Luke 23:11). Jesus is silent
                    in all cases and yet “sang in every tongue.”<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn85"

                    attentiveness to languages. Despite the concise character of his commentary on
                    the Babel episode and the utter ambiguity of his reference to the preservation
                    of the primordial tongue, there are multiple other examples in his works that
                    evidence his keen awareness of the world’s multilingualism and his constant
                    questioning of how languages operate. Whenever it was essential for his
                    multilayered typological exegesis, he never missed a chance to apply this vivid
                    interest in languages and communication to the biblical situations he analyzed. </p>
                <p xml:lang="en">The opposite, however, appears to be also true. Whenever the
                    biblical passage does not lend itself to typological interpretation or a
                    polemical cause, the purely historical or socio-linguistic reading is reported
                    by Ephrem, but only factually and succinctly. This seems to be the case with the
                    primordial language. Moreover, Ephrem’s lack of interest in the original tongue
                    is an indirect testimony to his siding with the mainstream Christian opinion of
                    the time, namely that it was Hebrew. If he had been a champion of Syriac
                    primordiality, he would not have missed a chance to emphasize that when he
                    interpreted Genesis 11. Ephrem is usually quite explicit about whatever polemics
                    he is engaged in, and that polemic is absent here.</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">One final piece of the puzzle is Ephrem’s reference to Hebrew in
                    the episode about Joseph and his brothers in Egypt from his <hi rend="italic"
                        >Commentary on Genesis </hi>discussed above. When Joseph eventually revealed
                    his identity to his brothers, he started to speak to them “in the Hebrew tongue”
                    (ܒܠܫܢܐ ܥܒܪܝܐ).<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn88" n="88"><p rend="footnote text">

                    brothers spoke Hebrew as their family language, according to Ephrem, one can
                    assume that their immediate ancestors, Jacob, Isaac, and Abraham, probably did
                    use this language as well. But was this the language and the nation that were “a
                    single exception” spared during the confusion at Babel? According to our take on
                    Ephrem’s thought, yes. However, the counterargument may be borrowed from
                    Theodore of Mopsuestia (c.350–428). Although we have only indirect and later
                    testimonies about his linguistic ideas,<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn89" n="89"

                    according to Yonatan Moss’s reconstruction, Theodore argued that Syriac was the
                    original tongue of humankind and that Hebrew appeared as a result of involuntary
                    corruption of Abraham’s native Syriac through the contact with the language of
                    Canaan when he moved there from Chaldea.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn90" n="90"

                    logic. Second, Theodore’s views are very uncertain. As Sergey Minov mentions,
                    “given the late nature of all these witnesses and the lack of unanimity on this
                    issue among East Syrian transmitters of the Theodoretan legacy, it seems
                    impossible at the present time to satisfactorily resolve the question of the

                    toward the statement that Edward Mathews and Joseph Amar put so beautifully:

                    of parallelism, typology, names, and symbols. In the creative application of
                    these tools, Ephrem displays a genius admirably suited to express the various

                <p xml:lang="en">While socio-linguistic and language-related historical speculations
                    seem to be tangential to Ephrem’s poetical and theological agenda, this approach
                    brings him close to the visions and thoughts of contemporaneous Greek writers,
                    primarily the Cappadocians. Like Gregory of Nyssa and Basil of Caesarea, Ephrem
                    presented language as an attribute of human nature. In his magnanimity, God may
                    condescend to use any language to be more approachable to people. Ephrem’s
                    interest in the plurality of actors in Genesis 11:7 places him in the 360s–370s
                    context of the Trinitarian debates about the Holy Spirit’s divinity. He supports
                    the idea that the Hebrews were named after Heber, reflecting the consensus of
                    Christian writers on this issue. All these observations usually go together with
                    acknowledging Hebrew as the primordial tongue. Although Ephrem never directly
                    stated the primacy of Hebrew, and his speculative etymology of biblical names
                    works equally well for Hebrew and Syriac, he likely shared the same ideas about
                    the early linguistic situation. He never explicitly mentioned Syriac as the
                    primordial tongue, and this absence is much more telling than the fact that he
                    skipped over mentioning Hebrew. </p>
                <p xml:lang="en">It is true that authentic writings of late antique Syriac authors,
                    including but not limited to Ephrem the Syrian, are surprisingly equivocal
                    whenever it comes to the identity of the pre-Babel language. Their views can be
                    reconstructed only to a degree by collating the bits of information from
                    indirect statements. However, it is essential to disentangle this problem to
                    understand the genesis of the idea about the primacy of Syriac. This
                    tremendously powerful and unprecedented identity statement on behalf of Syriac
                    Christian elites attested in the <hi rend="italic">Cave of Treasures</hi> and
                    then, from the eighth century, on different sides of the post-Chalcedonian
                    confessional divide. However, nowhere in his works does Ephrem seem to invest in
                    these polemics.</p>

    Instruction in Syriac at the University of Toronto began in
    1857, seven years after this institution replaced King’s
    College, which had been founded in 1827 through a Royal Charter
    from King George IV. A programme called “Oriental
    Literature,” including instruction in Hebrew, Aramaic,
    Syriac, Arabic and Samaritan, was established by the
    German-born Jacob Maier Hirschfelder (1819-1902), who must have
    taught all these languages. The university calendar for 1857-58
    indicates that the teaching of Syriac included “Grammar
    (Phillips’s); The Parables in the New Testament; History
    of the Syriac Language and Literature.” In 1886-87,
    Syriac was part of the Honour Course taught in the Second Year,
    and the grammar used was either “Uhlemann translated by
    Hutchinson, or Phillips, or Noeldeke”.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P2"/>[2] In 1889
    Hirschfelder was succeeded by his former assistant James
    Frederick McCurdy, a native of New Brunswick (1847-1935). He
    was a Semitist and Assyriologist, with degrees from Princeton,
    Tübingen, and Leipzig. His teachers were none other than
    the distinguished Delitzsch, Schrader, and Nöldeke.
    Post-graduate studies in “Orientals” appeared in
    the Calendar for 1889-90, and here the study of Syriac expanded
    beyond the Syriac Bible to “Selections from Bar Hebraeus,
    and Ephraem Syrus.” One of the reference books was
    Nöldeke’s <hi rend="italic">Kurzgefasste syrische Grammatik</hi>,
    which by that time was one of the most widely used grammars of
    Syriac. The Ph.D. programme in Oriental Languages, called in
    this context Semitic Languages or Semitics, was introduced in
    1897.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P3"/>[3] One of
    McCurdy’s assistants was William Robert Taylor, a
    graduate of Toronto in Theology and Bible; he succeeded McCurdy
    upon his retirement in 1914. Taylor, a native of Ontario
    (1882-1951), was an outstanding scholar who mastered several
    ancient languages and published extensively, mostly in the
    field of Biblical Studies. He must have been the supervisor of
    Frederick Victor Winnett, also a native of Ontario (1903-1989),
    who wrote his dissertation on the 13th century Syriac author
    ‛Abdīšō bar Brīkhā. This
    dissertation, entitled <hi rend="italic">Paradise of Eden</hi>, was
    “submitted in conformity with the requirements for the
    degree of Doctor of Philosophy in the University of
    Toronto;” it was published by the University of Toronto
    Press in 1929. In the introduction, Winnett justified his study
    of the <hi rend="italic">Paradise of Eden</hi>, saying “its avowed
    purpose is to display the resources and elegancies and
    subtleties of that tongue [Syriac], just as the Maqamat of
    al-Hariri was written to display the niceties of the Arabic
    language.” A master of Syriac and Arabic, Winnett devoted
    most of his research at the University of Toronto to
    Pre-Islamic Arabic studies.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P4"/>[4] In 1929
    Winnett was added to the staff as Lecturer, and one year later,
    another Syriac scholar, William Steward McCullough, became
    temporary Lecturer. McCullough, a native of Toronto
    (1902-1982), was also versed in all biblical languages,
    including Syriac. Overwhelmed by teaching duties, intensive
    research by him did not begin until he retired in 1970, and
    during his retirement he wrote his <hi rend="italic">A Short History of
    Syriac Christianity to the Rise of Islam</hi>, (published
    posthumously in 1982 by Scholars Press). This is an excellent
    tool for the study of both Eastern and Western branches of
    Syriac Christianity, and in it the author proved himself
    critical, comprehensive, and insightful. The minutes of the
    Council of University College dated September 20, 1982, reveal
    that at the time of Professor McCullough’s death, he
    “left behind a substantial portion of a translation from
    Syriac of a monumental work of the thirteenth century, the
    Ecclesiastical History by the learned Bar-Hebraeus.”
    Though the minutes state that “one of McCullough’s
    former students has undertaken to bring the task to
    completion,” neither the name of this student nor the
    fate of McCullough’s translation is now known.
    Unfortunately, this worthwhile study was never published.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P5"/>[5] In 1961,
    while McCullough was teaching Oriental Languages at University
    College, Professor Ernest George Clarke was appointed Associate
    Professor of Near Eastern Studies at Victoria College, where he
    taught Aramaic. Clarke was born in Ontario in 1927 and after he
    obtained a Master’s degree in Oriental Languages at the
    University of Toronto, he studied for his doctorate at Leiden
    University, the Netherlands, graduating in 1962. His doctoral
    dissertation was on Syriac: <hi rend="italic">The Selected Questions of
    Ishō Bar Nūn on the Pentateuch</hi>, published by
    Brill in 1962, but his research while at the University of
    Toronto concentrated on the targums until he retired in 1993.
    He died in Toronto in 1997 while still active in his targumic
    research.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P6"/>[6] One year
    after McCullough’s retirement in 1970, David John Lane
    was appointed Assistant Professor of Aramaic and Syriac in the
    then Department of Near Eastern Studies. David was born in 1935
    in England, where he studied Theology and Oriental Studies,
    concentrating on Hebrew, Aramaic and Syriac. At the University
    of Toronto he worked on the Syriac Bible, editing several books
    of the Old Testament for the Leiden Peshitta Institute,
    revising other books, and publishing a monograph that took
    Peshitta studies out of simple text criticism of the Old
    Testament into the wider field of Syriac church history and
    liturgy. Although he had received tenure in the department as
    Associate Professor, in 1983 Lane left Toronto to join the
    staff of the College of the Resurrection, Mirfield, near
    Huddersfield, England. After completing his work on the
    Peshitta, he began doing research on the Syriac Fathers,
    especially Shubhalmaran, a 7th century bishop and ascetic
    author. His edition and translation of the latter’s
    <hi rend="italic">Book of Gifts</hi> was published on Lane’s 70th
    birthday in the CSCO. He died in January 9, 2005, while
    lecturing on Syriac at the St Ephrem Ecumenical Research
    Institute, Kerala, India.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P7"/>[7] After
    Lane’s departure from Toronto in 1983, Ernest Clarke took
    over the teaching of Syriac, as well as his own area of
    Aramaic, in the department. From 1988 until the present time, a
    full undergraduate and graduate programme in Syriac studies has
    been directed by Amir Harrak in the Department of Near and
    Middle Eastern Civilizations.</p>

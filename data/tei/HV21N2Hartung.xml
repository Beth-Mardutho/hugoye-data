            <p xml:lang="en">This article examines the <hi rend="italic"
               >Mêmrâ on the Signs Moses Performed in Egypt</hi>, a text first published by J.J.
               Overbeck. Despite its attribution to Ephrem of Nisibis (ca. 307–373), this <hi
                  rend="italic">mêmrâ</hi> is not well-known in Syriac scholarship. In this article, I
               provide the first English translation of the text, and argue that it is the product of
               the literary circle of Ephrem in fourth-century Nisibis or Edessa. Furthermore, I
               contend that this prose exegetical homily represents a genre almost entirely unknown in
               extant early Syriac literature. As a witness to little-known exegetical and homiletical
               practices in that formative period, it enriches our understanding of the early emergence
               and development of Syriac Christian literary culture.</p>         </div>

               <p>Although scholars widely acknowledge Ephrem of Nisibis
                  (<hi rend="italic">ca. </hi>307–373) as a singular figure in
                  Syriac literature and a valuable source for Christianity in late antique Northern
                  Mesopotamia, many texts bearing his name remain untranslated and unstudied. Among
                  the vast corpus of little-known Syriac texts attributed to Ephrem is a prose
                  <hi rend="italic">mêmrâ </hi>entitled “First

                  correct this omission by providing the first English translation of
                  <hi rend="italic">MoS </hi>and integrating this homily more
                  fully into the scholarship on fourth-century Syriac literature. With its origins
                  in the the literary circle or “school” of Ephrem,
                  <hi rend="italic">MoS </hi>is a remnant of the early stage of
                  the flourishing of Syriac Christian literary culture. Although its artistic prose
                  style and narrow exegetical format are relatively anomalous, there is reason to
                  believe that <hi rend="italic">MoS </hi>bears witness to a
                  poorly-attested genre in early Syriac literature. As such, its style and
                  exegetical method are of great value for enhancing our understanding of this
                  decidedly murky period of Syriac history. </p>
               <p> This article makes two major claims about <hi rend="italic">MoS</hi>: first, that
                  it dates from the fourth or early fifth century; and second, that it belongs to
                  the “school” of Ephrem. With regard to text’s date, I draw on several streams of
                  evidence: the dating of the manuscript; the lack of influence from the exegesis of
                  Theodore of Mopsuestia and the “Antiochene school” (which rose to prominence in
                  Syriac exegesis in the mid-fifth century); and the absence of monastic interests
                  or priorities in the text (setting it apart from most later Syriac homiletical
                  material). For the second contention of this article—that
                  <hi rend="italic">MoS </hi>belongs to the “school” of
                  Ephrem—I offer three major points of evidence. For one, the text is of Syriac
                  origin, employing citations from the Peshiṭta rather than the Septuagint. Further,
                  <hi rend="italic">MoS </hi>has some literary relationship
                  (sharing common vocabulary and thematic elements) with Ephrem’s <hi rend="italic"
                     >Commentary<pb n="321"/>
                     on Exodus</hi>. Finally, although the genre of the text (a prose
                  exegetical homily, also identified as a <hi rend="italic">tûrgāmâ</hi>) appears to
                  be relatively unique among extant fourth-century Syriac sources, its exegetical
                  method has only two close parallels in Syriac literature: Ephrem’s
                  <hi rend="italic">Commentary on Genesis </hi>and <hi
                     rend="italic">Commentary on Exodus</hi>. </p>

               <p>Although few scholars have critically examined the <hi rend="italic">Mêmrâ on the
                     Signs</hi>, there is a small but important body of scholarship on the text.
                  Following Overbeck’s initial publication of <hi rend="italic">MoS</hi>, the
                  earliest evaluation of the text fell to F.C. Burkitt. In an appendix to his study
                  of the Gospel quotations in the writings of Ephrem, Burkitt judged all five prose
                  homilies preserved in B.L. Add. 17189 to be translations from Greek, and therefore
                     inauthentic.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn7" n="7"><p rend="footnote text">
                        Given that the subject of Burkitt’s inquiry was quotations from the Gospels,
                        and that no such quotations appear in <hi rend="italic">MoS</hi>, he did not
                        cite this specific <hi rend="italic">mêmrâ </hi>in his
                        analysis of the five homilies. See F.C. Burkitt, <hi rend="italic">Saint

                  literature (by Baumstark and Ortiz de Urbina), followed Burkitt in placing the
                  five <hi rend="italic">mêmrê </hi>preserved in B.L. Add.
                  17189 among “Ephremic” works of dubious authorship.<note place="foot"

                  Jansma concluded that the <hi rend="italic">mêmrâ </hi>was
                  the work of Ephrem. </p><pb n="323"/>
               <p> Jansma’s analysis advanced our understanding of
                  <hi rend="italic">MoS </hi>in two key respects. First, he
                  proved that the text was originally written in Syriac (relying upon Peshiṭta, not LXX, readings from Exodus).
                  Second, he demonstrated the extremely close textual relationship between
                  <hi rend="italic">MoS </hi>and Ephrem’s <hi rend="italic"
                     >Commentary on Exodus</hi>. The most problematic feature of Jansma’s analysis
                  was his singleminded focus on the question of authorship. As I shall demonstrate,
                  the authorship issue is not as clear-cut as Jansma argued. There are several
                  possible interpretations of the literary relationship between
                  <hi rend="italic">MoS </hi>and
                  <hi rend="italic">CommEx. </hi></p>
               <p> To make the case for an early date of composition (and address the issue of
                  authorship), we must turn to the single surviving manuscript of <hi rend="italic"
                     >MoS</hi>, the fifth/sixth century codex B.L. Add. 17189.<note place="foot"

                  indicates that the composition of
                  <hi rend="italic">MoS </hi>can date no later than the fifth
                  century. The attribution of authorship in the manuscript is somewhat more
                  complicated. The initial title (on fol. 1v) appears in a later hand, and
                  attributes the homilies to either Ephrem, Basil, or John Chrysostom. Running
                  titles on later folia, however, describe the texts as the work of Ephrem.<note

                  the headings attributing the homilies to Ephrem were written in a different hand
                  and thus offered no evidence as to their attribution at the time the codex was

                  are Syriac compositions and others are translations from Greek) it is possible
                  that when assembling this compilation of homilies, the original scribe did not
                  know or bother to attribute the collection to any single author.<note place="foot"

                        cursory) examination, Burkitt initially judged all of the homilies to be
                        original Greek compositions. (Burkitt, <hi rend="italic">Saint Ephraim’s
                           Quotations from the Gospel</hi>, 77). Later, Jansma argued that the
                        fourth and fifth homilies
                        (<hi rend="italic">On the Creation of the World </hi>and
                           <hi rend="italic">On the Sin of Adam</hi>) were translations of Greek
                        homilies of the Antiochene exegetical tradition. See Taeke Jansma, “Une

                        <hi rend="italic">L’Orient Syrien </hi>5 (1960):

                  that <hi rend="italic">MoS</hi> was composed at a relatively early date, but it

               <p> Despite their varied provenance, the five
                  <hi rend="italic">mêmrê </hi>of B.L. Add. 17189 share a
                  common profile.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn20" n="20"><p rend="footnote text">
                        Given the concurring presence of native Syriac homilies as well as
                        translated Greek homilies with an Antiochene exegetical bent within the
                        codex, Jansma attributed this codex to the “School of the Persians” in
                        fifth-century Edessa. (Taeke Jansma, “Les homélies du manuscrit Add. 17.189

                        412–440, 436–37).Jansma overstates the evidence for the existence of such a
                        school (a common problem discussed above). Nevertheless, this collection of
                        Greek and Syriac homilies attests to a transitional moment in Syriac
                        Christian literary production.</p></note> With the exception of the second
                  homily (<hi rend="italic">On the Fast</hi>) they each explicate a single passage
                  of Scripture. This is likely why the scribe identified them in a heading as
                  <hi rend="italic">tûrgāmê </hi>(“explanations” or
                     “interpre-tations”).<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn21" n="21"><p

                  exegetical focus. The manuscript evidence, therefore, supports the following
                  conclusions: that <hi rend="italic">MoS </hi>was written in
                  Syriac no later than the fifth century, compiled in a collection of
                  exegetically-oriented homilies—which the scribe identified as

                     >tûrgāmê</hi>—in the fifth or sixth century, and as a part of that collection
                  was not originally attributed to any particular author. To attribute
                  <hi rend="italic">MoS </hi>to the fourth/early fifth century,
                  and to the nebulous literary circle often described as the “school” of Ephrem,

                        more mature and therefore later (from Ephrem’s time in Edessa). The most
                        detailed implementation of this periodization appears in Christian Lange’s

                  activity that attempts to account for his renown as a teacher and the
                  sophisticated subject matter of his writings. He argues that Ephrem composed the

               <p> Others in Ephrem’s circle seem to have produced their own works during and after

                  pseudonymous Ephremic writings in the Syriac literary record, as tributes to or

                        while Egypt is an example of sin.” To support this reading, the author draws
                        upon Isaiah 1:18 and 1 Cor. 10:1–4. While this is not an uncommon approach
                        in early Christian texts, it is strikingly different from the limited frame

               <p>In this example, the homilist displays a striking willingness to bend the plain

                  is impossible! He derives this apparent contradiction from a close reading of the
                  biblical narrative, noting (following Exod 7:20–21) that
                  <hi rend="italic">all </hi>of the water in Egypt had turned
                  to blood. He then applies this information to the following verse’s claim that

                        rend="footnote text"> Jansma makes the odd claim that such inconsistencies

                        <hi rend="italic">MoS </hi>and Exodus were meant to
                        capture the attention of the audience. See Jansma, “Une homélie sur les

                  exegetical process. A problem raised by the biblical account becomes an
                  opportunity to expound an important theological theme: the distinction between
                  divine and creaturely activity. The homilist makes this point in a relatively
                  straightforward exegetical manner, considering a problematic passage by reference
                  to another part of the same passage. </p>
               <p> We can characterize the exegesis of
                  <hi rend="italic">MoS </hi>as follows: an absence of moral or
                  ascetic exhortation and theological application in favor of a subtle and narrow
                  form of narrative exegesis. In light of this evidence, we may venture the
                  following hypothesis regarding the purpose and performance of the homily. This
                  homily, along with perhaps many others (now lost), was not performed for a
                  liturgical audience, but for a smaller body, probably the ascetic literary circle
                  associated with Ephrem. Within this context, the homily (which may have been
                  variously described as a <hi rend="italic">mêmrâ </hi>or <hi
                     rend="italic">tûrgāmâ</hi>) likely functioned as a sort of exegetical exercise.
                  It retold a familiar biblical story in a way that clarified potential problems,
                  providing a pattern of interpretation for others to follow. This initial level of
                  exegetical work offered by the homily could then support moral or theological
                  applications of the biblical passage in other contexts.<pb n="340"/></p>

               <head>Conclusion</head>
               <p>When viewed in relation to other extant fourth-century Syriac literature,
                  <hi rend="italic">MoS </hi>is a strikingly unique work. It
                  bears a close literary relationship to Ephrem’s
                  <hi rend="italic">Commentary on Exodus </hi>and its
                  exegetical method is nearly identical to that of Ephrem’s commentaries. Its
                  elegant artistic prose, however, resembles texts like Ephrem’s <hi rend="italic"
                     >Mêmrâ on our Lord</hi>, while its format as a piece of narrative exegesis is
                  reminiscent of Ephrem’s metrical
                  <hi rend="italic">Mêmrâ on Nineveh and Jonah. </hi>Simply
                  put, although there are sufficient reasons to date this text to the fourth or
                  early fifth century and to attribute it to the Ephremic literary circle, there is
                  no other piece of extant early Syriac literature quite like this one. Regardless
                  of whether its author was Ephrem himself or someone in his circle (a question
                  which we cannot answer with certainty),
                  <hi rend="italic">MoS </hi>provides a crucial piece of
                  evidence for a form of homiletic writing almost entirely absent from the record of
                  early Syriac literature: the prose exegetical
                  <hi rend="italic">mêmrâ </hi>or
                  <hi rend="italic">tûrgāmâ. </hi>Why such forms of homiletic
                  composition were not favored by later Syriac copyists is unclear. Nevertheless,
                  <hi rend="italic">MoS </hi>offers new insight into the
                  little-known formative period of Syriac literary culture in fourth-century
                  northern Mesopotamia, shedding additional light on the exegetical practices and
                  forms of writing common to Ephrem’s literary circle. </p>

                                 been adept [at their sorcery], they would not have imitated Moses”
                                 (i.e., they would not have needed to simply mimic whatever he did).

                           finger of God,” which is stronger than all. Indeed, they saw that it was
                           the creative power of God and not human skill. For through the signs in
                           Egypt was seen the creative power of God, to whom be glory forever!

         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P1"/>[1] David
    Wilmshurst first became interested in the Church of the East
    when working as an administrator in the Hong Kong Government.
    He completed a doctoral thesis in 1998 at Oxford University
    under the supervision of Sebastian Brock and published ‘a
    significantly expanded version’ of his thesis in the
    <hi rend="italic">Subsidia</hi> series of the <hi rend="italic">Corpus Scriptorum
    Christianorum Orientalium</hi> (Leuven 2000). It is a book of
    imposing bulk, which only partially corresponds to the wide
    scope set out in the title: <hi rend="italic">The Ecclesiastical Organisation
    of the Church of the East, 1318-1913</hi>. What the author in
    facts does is to catalogue very scrupulously an impressive
    amount of documentary material relating to the history of the
    Church of the East.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P2"/>[2] Chapter
    1 (p. 1-15) provides the reader with general information on the
    book and a survey of the sources. It is remarkable how scanty
    the original Syriac historiography is in most of the centuries
    under study. After Bar Hebraeus’ <hi rend="italic">Chronography</hi> and
    the <hi rend="italic">History of Rabban Sawma and Mar Yahballaha</hi> (date of
    composition 1317-1319) and the additions to the
    <hi rend="italic">Chronography</hi> in the Bodleian Ms. 52 (relating the
    Timurid invasion of Mesopotamia in 1394), Syriac historiography
    seems to fade out until the 19th century.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P3"/>[3]
    Wilmshurst mentions here and there East-Syrian poetry composed
    on historical subjects (wars, famine, Kurdish assaults). It is
    probably among those poems written in Classical or Vernacular
    Syriac—few of them are published and even fewer carefully
    studied—that we should look for an East-Syrian perception
    of history from the Mongolian period to the 19th-century.
    Wilmshurst, however, does not appear to be interested in
    literature other than historical narrative as an indirect
    source for his reconstruction. For instance, Macuch’s
    <hi rend="italic">Geschichte der spät- und neusyrischen Literatur</hi>
    (Berlin-New York, 1976) does not appear in his
    bibliography.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P4"/>[4] The
    silence of (East-)Syrian historians is partly compensated for
    by other sources: colophons, inscriptions and—especially
    after the intensification of diplomatic contacts with Rome in
    the 16th century—the official correspondence between the
    Vatican and the East-Syrian Patriarchs, reports from
    missionaries, diaries of European travellers.
    Wilmshurst’s research focused on manuscript colophons,
    since, as the author states, ‘in many cases, the name of
    a priest or a deacon is the only evidence for Christian
    activity in a particular village’ (p. v).</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P5"/>[5] The
    author presents a fair discussion on the terminology used (p.
    4). Nevertheless, expressions such as ‘schism’,
    ‘conversion to Catholicism’ or ‘to become a
    Catholic’ used for describing the facts of 1552 and their
    consequences might have been more accurately pondered and
    discussed from the juridical and historical points of view. Was
    it really a schism? Who called/calls it a ‘schism’?
    Who converted/was converted to what? What did it mean ‘to
    became a Catholic’ in various circumstances? The same
    holds for ‘traditionalist’ used to distinguish
    those in the Church of the East who did not accept the union
    with Rome. Together with its counterpart
    ‘non-traditionalist’ used for the Catholic
    Chaldeans, the term ‘traditionalist’ may be a
    useful label for a Western scholar, but it risks introducing an
    external and questionable point of view onto dangerous ground.
    Which side tradition takes is often a moot point.</p>

         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P7"/>[7] In
    Chapters 3 to 6 (p. 38-341), the author arranges the
    information that he has collected according to geographical
    criteria. The result very much resembles Fiey’s
    <hi rend="italic">Assyrie Chrétienne</hi> (Beirut 1965-68), the
    corresponding paragraphs of which are quoted in square brackets
    beside Wilmshurst’s titles. Of each of the regions
    examined (Nisibis and Beth ‘Arabaye, Amid,
    Egypt-Syria-Palestine-Cilicia-Cypros, Mardin, Seert, Gazarta,
    ‘Amadiya, Berwari, ‘Aqra, Erbil, Kirkuk, Mosul,
    Hakkari, Urmia), the author sketches a brief
    ‘Ecclesiastical History’—in reality a survey
    of the  various dioceses—and a detailed
    ‘Topographical Survey’ with copious information on
    districts, villages, monasteries etc. Wilmshurst reports in
    detail and organizes the data provided by more than 2500
    East-Syrian colophons: number of manuscripts copied in a given
    place, names of scribes and genealogical reconstruction of
    their families, occasional historical information recorded by
    the copyists, ecclesiastical title of the persons mentioned in
    the colophons as copyist, copyist’s family or
    purchaser(s), etc.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P8"/>[8] The
    evidence provided by manuscript colophons is integrated with
    information coming from secondary sources. Whenever available,
    from the 19th century onwards, demographic data (number of
    Christian believers or families, priests, monks, churches;
    distribution of the population according to ethno-linguistic or
    religious criteria) are presented in clear tables. The use of
    secondary literature, however, turned out to be a little
    superficial in a number of cases into which I was able to
    inquire.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P9"/>[9] In 1654
    the Belgian Carmelite Fr. Dionysius of the Crown of Thorns
    visited the village of Telkepe, in the Mosul plain, to visit
    the Patriarch Mar Ilyas. In his diplomatic discussion with the
    Patriarch he received help from a ‘well-disposed’
    priest Joseph. Fiey (<hi rend="italic">Assyrie Chrétienne</hi> 359-360)
    identifies this priest Joseph with a Joseph mentioned in a
    colophon as <hi rend="italic">malpana</hi> ‘teacher, professor’,
    together with another priest Joseph <hi rend="italic">qankaya</hi>
    ‘sacristan, curate’. We know, thus, of the
    existence of at least two priests called Joseph in Telkepe in
    1654. Fiey suggests that the priest who met Fr. Dionysius was
    probably none other than Joseph son of Jamāl al-Dīn
    (‘Ce prêtre Yūsif est probablement le
    même que...’), author of a number of poems in
    Vernacular Syriac (see Macuch, <hi rend="italic">Geschichte</hi>, p. 99-100).
    Wilmshurst presents this identification as a fact, without
    providing further evidence: ‘Denys [Fr. Dionysius] tried
    unsuccessfully to persuade him [the Patriarch] to become a
    Catholic, with the help of the influential Telkepe priest
    Joseph, son of Jamāl al-Dīn. Joseph, who composed
    several religious poems…’ (p. 223-224).</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P10"/>[10]
    About the famous East-Syrian author and scribe Israel of
    Alqosh, Wilmshurst writes: ‘He remained a traditionalist
    [sic!] throughout his life, remarking in 1611 that he had
    preserved the old faith of the Church of the East,
    ‘corrupted by the Jacobites’ (p. 243. quoting H.L.
    Murre-van den Berg, ‘A Syrian Awakening. Alqosh and Urmia
    as Centers of Neo-Syriac Writing’, unpublished paper).
    The text by Israel of Alqosh runs in fact: ‘This is the
    profession of the faith of the <hi rend="italic">madden<hi rend="u">h</hi>āyē</hi> (Fiey: ‘Orientaux’).
    We have kept it truthfully from the time of the first apostles,
    and grace dwelled in it, and the
    <hi rend="italic">ya‘qubāyē</hi> (Fiey:
    ‘Nestoriens’) changed it’. I quote from the
    same paper by H.L. Murre-van den Berg, published in R. Lavenant
    (ed.), <hi rend="italic">VII Symposium Syriacum (1996)</hi>, Orientalia
    Christiana Analecta 256, Rome 1998, 499-515. It is difficult to
    find in these verses a conscious and explicit attempt to defend
    the ‘traditional’ faith of the Church of the East
    against the Catholic sympathies of others, unless we read a
    text such as that translated by Fiey, where
    ‘Jacobites’ (attested in all manuscripts available
    to me) was mysteriously or, better, ideologically replaced by
    ‘Nestorians’. Pace Wilmshurst (and Murre-van den
    Berg), Israel of Alqosh or whoever wrote those lines probably
    had no Catholics in mind at that moment.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P11"/>[11]
    Chapter 7 (p. 342-370) is an attempt to summarize and arrange
    chronologically the material that in the previous chapters is
    presented geographically, region by region, district by
    district, village by village. Important issues come to the fore
    in this chapter:</p>
         <list type="unordered">
            <item>the situation in the outlying provinces of the Church of
      the East (Persia, Central Asia, India, China) which,
      ‘with the important exception of India, collapsed
      during the second half of the fourteenth century’
      possibly because of ‘a combination of persecution,
      disease, and isolation’ (p. 345);</item>
            <item>the patriarchal succession, which is not documented by
      reliable evidence in the period 1318-1552, while  from
      1552 to the 19th century it is certain in the case of the
      Mosul patriarchate, but less exact for the successors of the
      rebellious Sulaqa;</item>
            <item>the population of the Church of the East (clergy and
      believers) throughout the centuries, with comparative
      statistics of the faithful to the Chaldean and Qudshanis
      Patriarchates in the last period relevant for the study (p.
      363): ‘With a membership of around 100,000 in 1913, the
      Chaldean church was only slightly smaller than the
      Qūdshānīs patriarchate (probably 120,000 East
      Syrians at most, including the population of the nominally
      Russian Orthodox villages in the Ūrmī
      region)’;</item>
            <item>an attempt at comparison of ‘the resources and
      influence of the Mosul, Qūdshānīs and
      Āmid patriarchates at different periods’ (p.
      343).</item>
         </list>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P12"/>[12] In 4
    appendixes, David Wilmshurst provides the reader with the
    corpora used as evidence in his study. Appendix One (p.
    371-377) contains ‘a concordance of manuscript catalogue
    numbers’. The concordances provided includes manuscript
    catalogues from ‘Aqra, Alqosh, Mosul, Telkepe, and Dohuk.
    Appendix Two (p. 378-732) is ‘a list of East-Syrian
    manuscript colophons and inscriptions’. The 2450 records
    are listed in chronological order from 615 to 1984 A.D. and
    arranged in five columns giving: catalogue number, date, place
    where the manuscript was copied, name of scribe(s), and other
    details useful as historical information. From the point of
    view of a Syriac scholar, possibly not of a historian, it is
    regrettable that no reference is made to the contents of the
    manuscripts. Appendix Three (p. 733-738) contains
    ‘extracts from the correspondence of the East-Syrian
    patriarchs’ in the Italian or Latin translation preserved
    in Rome and published by Giamil (Rome 1902) and Assemani (Rome
    1719-1728). Appendix Four (p. 739-746) contains a brief
    biography (4-9 lines)  of 41 Chaldean bishops of the 19th
    century.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P13"/>[13] The
    bibliography (p. 747-757) is divided into three sections:
    books, articles, manuscript collections and notes on
    manuscripts and inscriptions. In the third section of the
    bibliography (and in the study), manuscript collections
    containing texts in Vernacular Syriac (M. Lidzbarski<hi rend="italic">, Die
    neu-aramäischen Handschriften der Kgl. Bibliothek zu
    Berlin</hi>, 2 vol., Weimar 1896 and Y. Habbi,
    “Udabā’
    al-sūrith al-awā’il”, <hi rend="italic">Majallat
    al-majma‘
    al-‘ilmī al-‘irāqī
    al-hay’a al-suryānīya</hi> 4 (1978) 97-120) have
    not been included.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P14"/>[14] The
    work is complete with maps of the territories covered by the
    study. ‘The details given in these maps have been taken
    from the 1921 British G.S.G.S. map series ..., revised from an
    earlier I.D.W.O. map series of 1916, which has recently been
    used as the basis for an atlas of East Syrian settlement in
    Kurdistan [J.C.J. Sanders, <hi rend="italic">Assyro-chaldese christenen in
    oost-Turkije en Iran. Hun laatste vaderland opnieuw in kaart
    gebracht</hi>, A.A. Brediusstichting, Hernen 1997]’ (p.
    8).</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P15"/>[15] The
    quantity of material that the author has analyzed is immense.
    The amount of information he has managed to include in 370
    pages of discussion, 51 tables, 4 genealogical trees, 5
    concordance tables of manuscript catalogues, 350 pages of
    data-base on manuscript colophons and inscriptions, 2 indexes
    (of places, p. 758-795 and proper names, p. 796-845), and 7
    excellent maps is really impressive. This book will certainly
    become an indispensable research tool for students of the
    Church of the East and Syriac scholars.</p>
    
    
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P16"/>[16] Two
    important East Syriac works by ‘Abdisho‘ bar Brikha
    (<hi rend="italic">Kunasha d-qanone sunhadiqaye</hi>—ed. by A. Mai, Rome
    1838—and <hi rend="italic">Tukkās dine 'edtanaye</hi>, composed
    respectively in 1284 and 1315-1316) do not appear among the
    sources used by Wilmshurst. Their content is canonical and
    provides a picture of the ecclesiastical structure of the
    Church of the East at the beginning of the 14th century.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P17"/>[17] The
    facts of 1552, which eventually led to the East-Syrian Uniate
    movement, represent an important change in the history of the
    Church of the East. In this connection, it would have been
    worth mentioning the fact that the <hi rend="italic">primatus Petri</hi> was a
    canonical principle fairly well established in the East-Syrian
    milieu a couple of centuries before Sulaqa’s rebellion.
    ‘Abdisho‘ bar Brikha, e.g., attributes the
    <hi rend="italic">shultanutha</hi> over all the patriarchs to the successor of
    Peter, the bishop of Rome (<hi rend="italic">Kunasha d-qanone
    sunhadiqaye</hi>—ed. by A. Mai, <hi rend="italic">Scriptorum veterum nova
    et inedita collectio</hi> X, Rome 1838, 327, 165). The patriarch
    Mar Yahballaha III addressed the Pope in similar terms in an
    Arabic letter dated 1304 (L. Bottini, ‘Due lettere
    inedite del patriarca Mar Yahballaha III (1281-1317)’,

    Chapter 2, some statements about the history of the 14th
    century need to be corrected or at least toned down. When the
    author comments upon the diplomatic mission of Rabban Sawma
    (1287-1288, not 1284-1285 as stated on p. 17) and says that
    ‘the Church of the East worked... to encourage a
    Mongol-Christian alliance against the Mamluk’ (p. 16-17),
    he is probably going too far. As far as we know, there is no
    evidence to support such an interpretation. The role of
    ecclesiastical ‘ambassadors’ sent by the Ilkhans
    was not a consequence of a specific interest of the Church in
    political and military alliance, and their position was
    subordinated to that of other ambassadors—Western, mainly
    Genoese, guests at the Ilkhanid court—who were sent with
    them. Of course, the <hi rend="italic">History of Rabban Sawma and Mar
    Yahballaha</hi> might give us a different impression, due to the
    origin and character of the narrative. But it should not be
    forgotten that, even though Rabban Sawma’s mission is
    ‘the best known Mongol initiative towards the Christian
    powers’ (p. 17), it was only one of many and not
    necessarily the most successful.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P19"/>[19] The
    hypothesis that the synod of 1318 had to cope with the
    corruption and illiteracy of the clergy ‘perhaps because
    Yahballaaha III, who knew little Syriac himself, had been
    unable to control his bishops and visitors effectively’
    (p. 18) does not appear to be based on solid grounds. It was
    precisely during the partiarchate of Mar Yahballaha III that
    ‘Abdisho‘ bar Brikha wrote his canonical works,
    which may bear witness to the patriarch’s interest in
    setting up an ‘up-dated’ set of rules for the
    Church of the East, although he personally was not a scholar,
    an exegete, or a canonist as his predecessors and successor
    were. Wilmshurst refers to probable difficulties in the
    relationship between Mar Yahballaha and (some of) his bishops.
    This conjecture is in fact supported by evidence provided by
    Ricoldo da Montecroce, who attended a debate in Baghdad between
    Mar Yahballaha and some bishops about the permission to preach
    that the patriarch had given to the Latin missionaries (Riccold
    de Monte Croce, <hi rend="italic">Pérégrination en Terre Sainte
    et au Proche Orient</hi>. Texte latin et traduction, <hi rend="italic">Lettres
    sur la chute de Saint-Jean d’Acre</hi>. Traduction par R.
    Kappler, Paris 1997, 152-155).</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P20"/>[20] The
    ‘humane emir Choban’ had much more than ‘an
    important moderating influence on the il-khan Abu Said’.
    Choban was in fact the real ruler at the beginning of the reign
    of Abu Said, who came to the throne as a boy. Indeed Amir
    Choban was a Muslim, and the good will he showed to the
    Christians according to the <hi rend="italic">History of Rabban Sawma and Mar
    Yahballaha</hi> may have sprung more from political calculation
    than from ‘humane’ disposition.</p>

    Finally, the note about the Ms. Vat. Syr 622 (p. 390) needs
    correction: the princess Sara was not the daughter, but the
    sister of Giwargis, king of the Önggüd (autoptical
    check in Rome, 21-06-2002).</p>

                    <p>Around 30 scholars from more than a dozen different countries met in
                        Amsterdam in mid-March for two days of discussions and presentations on
                        developments in digital humanities in Syriac language and literature.</p>

                    <p>Participants were welcomed to the workshop and Amsterdam by Professor Joke
                        van Saane, Vice-Dean of the Faculty of Theology at VU Amsterdam and
                        Professor Wido van Peursen, the workshop organizer and host.</p>
                    <p>Following an overview of digital Syriac projects in the Netherlands (<ref target="https://www.nwo.nl/en/research-and-results/research-projects/i/57/19157.html">CALAP</ref>, <ref target="https://www.nwo.nl/en/research-and-results/research-projects/i/79/1179.html">Turgama</ref>, <ref target="http://www.cltl.nl/teaching/student-assistant-projects/polemics-visualised/">Polemics Visualized</ref>, Topic Visualizer for Syriac texts, <ref target="https://www.clariah.nl/projecten/research-pilots/linksyr/linksyr">LinkSyr</ref>

                        Text, e-CSCO), Professor van Peursen explained the methodology behind the
                        projects, which aim to produce more reliable versions of Syriac texts than
                        are currently available.</p>
                    <p>Hannes Vlaardingerbroek (Leiden/Amsterdam), presented an overview of the <ref target="https://www.clariah.nl/en/projects/research-pilots/granted-pilot-research-projects/linksyr#abstract">LinkSyr project</ref>, which is using data in the form
                        of tagged and untagged morphological terms from existing projects and
                        materials and collating them into one dataset, with 160,000 items already
                        tagged of what will eventually comprise more than one million terms.
                        However, there is not enough data to train reliable HMM language models:
                        existing tagging methods for Semitic languages, such as Hebrew and Arabic,
                        use large corpora to train language models, which are not currently
                        available for Syriac. Syromorph (BYU) claims high accuracy but is not yet
                        compatible with the LinkSyr data. Mathias
                        Coeckelbergs (Brussels and Leuven), discussed the nature of the data in more
                        detail and longer-term plans, such as linking terms to the <ref target="http://syriaca.org/">syriaca.org</ref> database, providing
                        automatic reading tools for non-Syriac specialists, and more efficient
                        search facilities. The dataset has some limits, as the method works by
                        recognizing surface forms, which can have multiple translations. Eventually,
                        it is hoped the classification of URIs will be more data-driven and
                        searchable for specific collections of texts.</p>
                    <p>Following this, George Kiraz (Beth Mardutho) described the process for
                        converting Syriac lexicons from image to text files, creating an <ref target="https://sedra.bethmardutho.org/">on-line, searchable
                            dictionary</ref>, as part of the <ref target="https://sedra.bethmardutho.org/about/sedra">SEDRA</ref> project.
                        While <ref target="https://sedra.bethmardutho.org/about/sedra">SEDRA</ref>
                        was designed specifically for Syriac, the project has the technical
                        capability to be expanded to include other Semitic languages and is looking
                        for funding to achieve this longer-term aim.</p>
                    <p>David A. Michelson (Vanderbilt) provided an update on the <ref target="http://syriaca.org/">syriaca.org</ref> project, which has minted
                        URIs for places, persons, primary source texts and citations (bibliographic
                        items), and published them online. URIs relating to factoids (events),
                        ontology (keyword classification) and manuscripts are available as raw data.
                        The project is currently looking for someone to do the same for artifacts.
                        Daniel L. Schwartz (Texas A&amp;M) demonstrated the various features the
                        site offers.</p>
                    <p>James Walters (Oxford-BYU Syriac Corpus) talked participants through the
                        structure and functions of the Oxford-BYU website and the new edition of

                    <p>Daniel Stökl ben Ezra (EPEH Paris), demonstrated the interface and search
                        functions offered by the <ref target="http://www.lectionary.eu/">ThALES
                            lectionary database</ref>, which includes material in Syriac and
                        Arabic.</p>
                    <p>In the afternoon, a number of working groups discussed Lexicography, Named
                        Entities, Liturgy, Text Corpus Creation, Scholars’ Needs and Interests, How
                        to Bridge Syriac Linked Data and the Syriac Community and Linking to Other
                        Traditions such as Arabic and Ethiopic, and brainstormed recommendations and
                        suggestions for future projects.</p>
                    <p>The workshop continued on the second day with further project presentations
                        and updates on the <ref target="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/M005704/1">Galen
                            Palimpsest</ref> and <ref target="https://uclouvain.be/fr/instituts-recherche/incal/ciol/the-concordances-of-the-gregori-project.html">GREgORI</ref> projects and <ref target="https://www.oeaw.ac.at/en/byzantine-research/byzantium-and-beyond/mobility-and-intercultural-contacts/hunaynnet/">Hun@yannet</ref>. Natalia Smelova (Manchester) began by presenting the
                        results of research on the Syriac Galen Palimpsest, which has been fully
                        digitized using multispectral technology, with the resulting images
                        available free online. The tools and software developed as a part of the
                        project will also be made available to individuals and institutions dealing
                        with multi-layered texts.</p>
                    <p>Grigory Kessel (Austrian Academy of Sciences/ Manchester) and Slavomír Čéplö
                        (Austrian Academy of Sciences), showcased the ERC-funded <ref target="https://www.oeaw.ac.at/en/byzantine-research/byzantium-and-beyond/mobility-and-intercultural-contacts/hunaynnet/">Hun@yannet</ref> database, consisting of a Greek-Syriac-Arabic corpus
                        of Classical scientific and philosophical literature. Hun@yannet will allow
                        for a comprehensive comparison of Syriac and Arabic translations of Greek
                        texts, through lexicographical analysis, for which a dedicated research tool
                        is being developed. It will be capable of handling vertical texts in UTF-8
                        encoding, (with manual parallel alignment by sentence or clause units), via
                        a TEI to HTML transformation reading interface. While there remain some
                        issues with parallel corpora, search by REGEX of 15 texts with 50
                        translations in Syriac and Arabic is already possible.</p>
                    <p>Bastien Kindt (Leuven), also presented the <ref target="https://uclouvain.be/fr/instituts-recherche/incal/ciol/the-concordances-of-the-gregori-project.html">GREgORI</ref> project, a free, multi-lingual corpus and fully
                        lemmatized concordance, with parts of speech tagged, although Syriac is
                        still to be completed.</p>
                    <p>In the afternoon, the working groups reported their findings from the
                        previous day with the Lexicography working group stressing the need for both
                        archival/reading and linguistic analysis versions of texts. A general
                        consensus was reached that a TEI format of a Syriac text was useful for
                        archival, canonical, and human readable formats and that texts would then
                        need to be “unwrapped” or converted for use in text analysis tools such as
                        Text Fabric. As Text Fabric uses the word as the basic entity, more work
                        would be needed to handle idiomatic phrases, compound nouns and names. It
                        was suggested that Syriaca.org and SEDRA might ensure that two types of
                        tagging could be facilitated by dividing the NER into two stages: the
                        identification of proper nouns as simply being proper nouns and the
                        identification of specific names and concepts for persons, places, etc.</p>
                    <p>The Named Entities group discussed the desirability for current projects to
                        be structured so as to permit a machine-generated model of Syriac
                        scholarship in the future, which could be created by the analysis of named
                        entities and their links; methods that diverse projects could use link to
                        named entities, through using URIs minted by Syriaca.org, with the resulting
                        benefit of creating a collective body of linked data and making various
                        diverse projects discoverable through Syriaca.org. For projects linking to
                        Syriaca.org URIs, the preferred method was to link to permanent Syriaca.org
                        URIs (e.g. <ref target="http://syriaca.org/place/78">
                        <hi rend="underline color(1155CC)">http://syriaca.org/place/78</hi>
                    </ref>). Syriaca.org agreed to provide
                        content negotiation for this purpose and was willing to link to projects in
                        any way desired e.g. permanent URIs, RESTful API queries. The group also
                        discussed how to generate a cloud of RDF data related to Syriac from various
                        projects, concluding that more discussion was needed to work out how to
                        create, host and query this.</p>
                    <p>These two groups concluded by agreeing on a protocol for connecting various
                        digital texts online in various formats, considering it desirable for all
                        projects to use CTS/DTS URNs. Syriaca.org offered to serve as a catalogue
                        for various projects and conservator of standards. Through the New Handbook
                        of Syriac Literature, Syriaca.org could also provide a standard form for the
                        first half of a CTS URN, language, corpus, work family, work number. The
                        second half, the local ids, would then be published by each individual
                        project. The resulting URNs would then be combined, crosswalked, archived
                        and catalogued by Syriaca.org. The end result would be to establish a
                        standard method for citation and api calls to digital Syriac texts across
                        all projects.</p>
                    <p>The Liturgy working group members agreed future cooperation between LinkSyr
                        and ThALES, either through the exchange and/or linking of data. A liturgical
                        app is being developed by George Kiraz, with Srophe potentially hosting it.
                        The Text Corpus group looked at how synergy could best be established,
                        recommending joining forces to avoid the same work being done twice and also
                        suggested potential collaboration with commercial partners. It was noted
                        that many projects have encoding at the word level, which is sufficient for
                        a large corpus with a broad public audience, but linguists and exegetes may
                        required more layers of analysis. The group also agreed to form a standing
                        committee to follow-up on discussions at the workshop, identify issues and
                        make their materials available on GitHub and hold a regular Google hangout
                        seminar for Syriac studies.</p>
                    <p>The group on Other Traditions discussed the fact that, except for the
                        connections with Greek loan words and the Bible, this area is otherwise
                        generally neglected. The group felt the most important traditions to link to
                        were, qurʾānic Arabic, Aramaic, medieval Arabic/Greek philosophy and
                        non-Christian sources, and that there was a need for more inter-disciplinary
                        tools. More video-based help guides instead of text-based explanations of
                        how to make use of the various aspects of the databases available, were also
                        requested and it was felt there was a need to somehow bridge the gap between
                        those specialised in digital humanities and those wanting to develop a
                        digital aspect to their research projects.</p>
                    <p>The working group looking at How to Bridge Develop-ments in the Digital
                        Humanities with the Syriac Community, felt that a focus on language,
                        liturgy, tradition and history would be beneficial to members of the Syriac
                        Orthodox community, and also provide a means of strengthening their sense of
                        identity and heritage. Liturgical and Bible readings with accurate
                        vocalization and options for comparison (e.g. how to deal with those Sundays
                        for which there are no readings), and musical aspects were also considered
                        desirable. They also supported the translation of lectionaries into Turoyo
                        with a format comparable to the ThALES database with additional audio/visual
                        recordings, which would be particularly useful for a non-academic audience,
                        who could then actually <hi rend="italic">hear</hi> the word of God. While
                        there are large amounts of audio/visual resources available online, it was
                        felt that it would be useful to somehow collect and organise these and link
                        specific topics with other online resources. Regarding the public impact
                        aspect of the LinkSyr project, it was agreed there was a need to create more
                        awareness of what tools the University can offer the Community, perhaps
                        through offering some sort of training about this. The University and
                        Community could also facilitate more exchange in the form of visits,
                        lectures etc. Addressing young people was considered one of the biggest
                        challenges; while there is some material available for teenagers, there is
                        not much for younger children. Since teenagers tend not to read books,
                        digital tools that can be used on a tablet/smartphone, such as interactive
                        apps, games, etc. were also recommended. Regarding the question of how to
                        translate information for children, it was felt the NT2 method (<hi rend="italic">Dutch as a second language</hi>) was considered a good
                        guideline. Regarding the financial aspect of community interaction, while
                        attracting more people was obviously a positive, it was felt important that
                        they be paid for their contributions (e.g. transcribing manuscripts), either
                        through financial recompense or, in the case of university students, perhaps
                        in exchange for skills/experience. Crowdsourcing was also discussed as a
                        possible means of obtaining knowledge/skills free of charge.</p>
                    <p>The Scholars' Interests group asked whether current projects really meet the
                        needs of scholars and if not, what desiderata and caveats these projects
                        should take into account, in order to develop things that are really useful.
                        Amongst the issues they outlined were; the use of the techniques under
                        discussion to make stylistic analyses or characterizations of texts, to
                        identify authors, or compare texts and translations; how to publish texts,
                        which are both in print with a publisher and in a digital format in the open
                        domain, and how to refer to digital texts, that in time may change, or
                        otherwise remain fluid in their presentation. It was felt that audiences
                        could be successfully reached by means other than promotion e.g. by
                        providing interfaces in Arabic, Persian and Turkish, and that there should
                        be further campaigns for the implementation of Syriac word processing; the
                        submission of additional characters to the Unicode Consortium; an update of
                        the Meltho fonts; an approach made to Apple about the implementation of
                        Syriac, and the development of a cross-platform Syriac language pack for
                        LibreOffice.</p>
                    <p>The workshop provided a rare opportunity for face-to-face discussion and
                        exchange amongst scholars working with Syriac in a variety of fields and it
                        is to be hoped that the connections that were made at the workshop continue
                        to develop to the benefit of current and future projects.</p>

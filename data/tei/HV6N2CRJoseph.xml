            <p>Hugoye: Journal of Syriac Studies is an electronic journal dedicated to the study
                        of the Syriac tradition, published semi-annually (in January and July) by Beth
                        Mardutho: The Syriac Institute. Published since 1998, Hugoye seeks to offer the
                        best scholarship available in the field of Syriac studies.</p>

         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P1"/>[1] The
    Fourth International Forum on Syriac Computing was held in
    conjunction with the Fourth North American Syriac Symposium at
    Princeton Theological Seminary, Princeton, New Jersey on July
    11, 2003. The Forum as well as the Symposium were co-sponsored
    by Princeton Theological Seminary, Princeton University, The
    Institute for Advanced Study, and Beth Mardutho: The Syriac
    Institute.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P2"/>[2] Five
    papers and a tutorial were presented at the forum in three
    sessions. Several participants attended the sessions. The
    sessions were streamed live over the internet enabling
    participants from the USA, Canada, Europe, Australia and even
    Saudi Arabia to listen live remotely to the presentations and
    discussions that followed. The streamed media will be archived
    on the <ref target="http://www.bethmardutho.org/">Beth Mardutho</ref>
    website.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P3"/>[3] In the
    first session chaired by Prof. William Clocksin two papers were
    presented. The first was by Thomas Joseph, Web Master of the
    <ref target="http://sor.cua.edu/">Syriac Orthodox
    Resources</ref> web site, on the automated generation of the
    liturgical calendar and lectionary of the Syriac Orthodox
    Church. The paper, co-authored with Simon Skaria of Microsoft,
    provided an overview of the evolution of the liturgical
    calendar in the Syriac Orthodox Church, the algorithms for
    generating the calendar, and the description of an
    implementation of the algorithms in a Java
    application.<lb/>
         </p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P4"/>[4] This was
    followed by a presentation by Emil Soleyman-Zomalan, Web Master
    of <ref target="http://www.bethmardutho.org/">Beth Mardutho</ref>, on
    the architecture and implementation of the re-designed Beth
    Mardutho web site. Participants offered both speakers many
    worthy ideas for enhancing the respective implementations.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P5"/>[5] In the
    second session chaired by Thomas Joseph three papers were
    presented. George Kiraz, Director of Beth Mardutho, and Steve
    Caruso, the lead programmer of the eBeth Arke project,
    presented an overview and demonstration of the eBeth Arke: The
    Syriac Digital Library Project. This is an ambitious project
    which will create a digital archive of mss., out-of-copyright
    books, journal articles, and collections of other multimedia
    material of relevance to Syriac Studies. Such a project will be
    an immense resource for scholars in Syriac Studies and
    facilitate research in the field. A beta site with 50 books was
    used to demonstrate how scholars will be able to access such a
    library on-line for their research.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P6"/>[6] Next,
    William Clocksin presented a paper on the automatic recognition
    of Syriac handwriting, co-authored with Prem P.J. Fernando. The
    paper described several computer-based techniques developed for
    the automatic transcription of Estrangelo handwriting from
    historical manuscripts. Data on the recognition rates achieved
    in experiments using a variety of segmentation methods were
    presented. This is a very promising line of research that will
    advance automatic handwriting recognition in general; but more
    importantly for Syriac Studies scholars and Syriac communities,
    this will hopefully bear fruit in the form of a handwriting
    recognition product which will facilitate the digitization of
    Syriac mss. into electronic text. The <ref target="HV6N2ClocksinFernando.html">paper</ref> is published in this
    issue of Hugoye.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P7"/>[7] The
    final paper in the session, on Meltho: Syriac Open Type fonts,
    was presented by Sargon Hasso. Sargon described the design and
    architecture of the Meltho fonts that support three major
    Syriac scripts: Estrangelo, Serto, and East Syriac. Meltho
    fonts are based on the OpenType fonts supported by Microsoft
    Windows operating systems and the Syriac character encoding
    specified in Unicode 3.0. Sargon discussed the challenges in
    designing fonts for traditional Syriac scripts such as the
    contextual variation of letter shapes, diacritics and their
    placement on characters, ligatures and other unique behaviors.
    He then highlighted the features of the OpenType font
    technology which enable the glyph shaping logic to be embedded
    within the font files offering the designer flexibility and
    control over glyph shape rendering by the target operating
    systems. Current support for Meltho fonts in popular desktop
    applications as well future support with emerging technology
    standards such as XSL FO were briefly addressed.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P8"/>[8] In the
    third and final session, George Kiraz presented a tutorial on
    using Syriac in Windows XP. The tutorial provided instructions
    on the installation of Meltho fonts, and demonstrations on
    using these fonts in Windows applications. Participants who had
    difficulties with the installation of the fonts on their
    computers were able to get these resolved during the
    tutorial.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P9"/>[9] The
    fourth International Forum on Syriac Computing was a resounding
    success. As with the past forums, it provided an opportunity
    for an esoteric group of scholars, technology architects and
    developers to interact and exchange ideas on harnessing
    technologies for supporting scholarly research in Syriac
    Studies and enriching the religious and cultural heritage of
    Syriac speaking communities.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P10"/>[10] This
    was the first forum to be streamed live on the internet, thanks
    to the exceptional efforts of the media personnel at Princeton
    Theological Seminary. The archives of the streamed media will
    be made available on the <ref target="http://www.bethmardutho.org/">Beth Mardutho</ref> web site. The
    wider dissemination of information on the innovative projects
    presented at the forum will hopefully attract more talent into
    this narrow but important field of activity, so essential to
    bringing Syriac Studies into the third millenium.

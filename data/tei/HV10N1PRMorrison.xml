         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P1"/>[1] The
    question of the relationship of the OT Peshitta to the other
    ancient versions continues to capture the interest of Peshitta
    scholars. While past research indicates that the Peshitta is,
    for the most part, an independent translation of a Hebrew
    <hi rend="italic">Vorlage</hi>, this conclusion still needs to be refined for
    each book of the Bible. The problem stems from the uncertain
    origins of the OT Peshitta. It is not unreasonable to presume
    that the Peshitta translator, working from a Hebrew text, also
    consulted a Greek version of the Bible and perhaps a Jewish
    Aramaic version as well. To further complicate matters, the
    first manuscript evidence is a good three centuries after the
    translation emerged. By that point, the Peshitta, which may
    have been the work of Jewish translators, was firmly in the
    hands of Syriac speaking Christians who knew the Greek Bible.
    One line of inquiry into the Peshitta�s character involves the
    study of the relationship between the Peshitta with other
    versions of the Bible. It is within this arena that Erbes'
    dissertation, presented to the faculty of Semitic Languages at
    Uppsala University, situates itself.</p>
         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P2"/>[2] At the
    outset, Erbes asks the question: �How does the Peshitta sphere
    relate to the Jewish sphere, the Septuagint sphere, and the
    Vulgate?� (p. 24). He wants to uncover evidence of versional
    influence (especially the Septuagint) on the Peshitta. The bulk
    of his volume presents a verse by verse analysis of the variant
    readings in the Peshitta of Joshua 1-5. Even the most minor
    Peshitta divergences are discussed. The first reading he treats
    is the question of the <hi rend="italic">waw</hi> on <hi rend="italic">wy�mr</hi>�in the MT
    of Josh 1:1 which the Peshitta renders <hi rend="italic">�mr</hi> (�he
    said�).�He notes that the Syriac tradition uniformly reads
    <hi rend="italic">�mr</hi> (without <hi rend="italic">waw</hi>). He then provides a
    retroversion of the MT(<hi rend="italic">wy�mr</hi>) into Syriac
    (<hi rend="italic">w�mr</hi>). One could quibble as to whether this
    retroversion is even possible in Syriac as it produces a rather
    �unsyriac� construction (the verb <hi rend="italic">�mr</hi> in Josh 1:1
    introduces the main clause after the subordinate clause
    introduced with <hi rend="italic">wmn b<!--<u>-->t<!--</u>-->r d</hi>). He then discusses
    the versional evidence for the <hi rend="italic">waw</hi> (the Targum and
    some Greek versions reflect the <hi rend="italic">waw</hi>). Erbes concludes
    that the �absence of the <hi rend="italic">waw</hi> is idiomatically the
    equivalent of the Masoretic Text� (p. 60) and that the Peshitta
    is free from versional influence. The study proceeds in this
    fashion, considering every variation between the MT and the
    Peshitta in Joshua 1-5.</p>
         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P3"/>[3] The
    discussions at the end of each variant studied reveal that most
    often the Peshitta offers an independent reading. Some variants
    are so minor that they defy explanation.�But Erbes tries
    anyhow.�He suggests that the variant word order in some
    Peshitta MSS in Josh 1:4, stresses the proper name of the river
    �Euphrates,� �triggered by the relative proximity of the
    translator to it.� His competent study would not have been
    compromised had such imaginative explanations been left aside.
    Sometimes Peshitta readings are treated in isolation, such as
    the translation <hi rend="italic">�yk dbzq�</hi> for Hebrew <hi rend="italic">nd</hi> (Josh
    3:16). Erbes suggests that the Peshitta reading �is possibly an
    adapted translation of the Hebrew �dam� or a misreading with a
    Mishnaic background� (p. 219). Both explanations are possible,
    but it should be acknowledged that the Peshitta translation for
    this Hebrew term also appears in Exod 15:8 and Pss 33:7 and
    78:13.</p>
         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P4"/>[4] As
    Peshitta scholars will be interested in the results of this
    technical research, I offer a summary below:</p>
         <list type="ordered">
            <item>The Peshitta normally follows the MT.</item>
            <item>The Peshitta rarely follows the Septuagint./li&gt;</item>
            <item>The Targum did not influence the Peshitta.</item>
            <item>The Peshitta-Ethiopic parallels suggest direct contact or
      contact through a lost Septuagint MS.</item>
            <item>Most unique Peshitta readings can be explained by
      translation technique.</item>
         </list>
         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P5"/>[5] More
    than once the author acknowledges the quantitative limitations
    of his research. But the copious data Erbes presents witnesses
    to his ardent search for even the most minor trace of influence
    from these versions on the Peshitta. For this reason his
    conclusions are well founded.</p>

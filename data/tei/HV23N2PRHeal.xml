				<p> This important book is about a simple question: why does Jacob of Serugh pair
					suffering and miracles when talking about Christ in his <hi rend="italic"
						>memre</hi>? This question naturally demands a close reading of Jacob’s
					homilies (chapters 4–6), together with a detailed examination of his letters
					(chapter 3), an exploration of Jacob’s relationship to contemporaneous Syriac
					and Greek sources, and ultimately the project of tracing this pairing of
					suffering and miracles back to key Chalcedonian documents (chapter 2). <hi
						rend="italic">Preaching Christology</hi> tells this story with great skill
					and erudition. Since its publication, reviews of this book have appeared in
					several journals, and I refer the reader to those for chapter-by-chapter
					summaries and for engagement with Forness’s work on Jacob’s Christology. <note
						place="foot" xml:id="ftn1" n="1"><p xml:lang="en">
							<hi rend="italic">Bryn Mawr Classical Review</hi> 2019.08.21 (Jaclyn
							Maxwell); <hi rend="italic">Reviews in Religion and Theology</hi> 26
							(2019), 625–628 (Jacob Lollar); <hi rend="italic">Journal of Early
								Christian Studies</hi> 28 (2020), 149–151 (Volker Menze); and <hi
								rend="italic">Scrinium</hi> 16 (2020) (Dmitry Bumazhnov).
						</p></note> In this review I focus on the book’s two important
					methodological and theoretical claims. </p>
				<p> The underlying message of <hi rend="italic">Preaching Christology</hi> is that
					Jacob of Serugh’s language reflects a deep and thoughtful engagement not only
					with his literary culture, but also with his contemporary theological and
					political world. But how does Forness derive this from Jacob’s verse homilies?
					One way that Forness allays his readers’ concerns about connecting Jacob’s
					poetic pairing of the suffering and miracles of Christ with contemporary
					theological thought is by allowing us to observe this connection in the safer
					genre of epistolography: “[Jacob’s] letters <pb n="418"/> justify the connections
					[we draw] between Jacob’s homilies and the specific debate over the <hi
						rend="italic">Henotikon</hi> in the second and third decades of the sixth
					century” (p. 90; cf. 133). Not only do we expect careful forensic argumentation
					in this genre, but letters can be more readily historicized (pp. 115–125). They
					often have a known addressed audience, and a more readily discoverable cultural
					setting (pp. 104–115). They can often be dated (pp. 110, 125). Syriac
					homilies resist the historian’s need for certainty. As Forness’s far-reaching
					comparative first chapter is forced to conclude, when we work with Syriac
					homilies we are almost always unmoored from a specific time, place, and context,
					which means that a different set of tools are needed to tease out their
					significance. These are the tools of the literary critic, the philologist, and
					the intellectual historian. When these tools are deployed together the Syriac
					sermon begins to yield some of its latent potential. </p>
				<p> Thus, <hi rend="italic">Preaching Christology</hi> is offering an important
					response to one of the great problems in the study of Syriac late antiq- uity,
					namely the seeming inscrutability of a large portion of extant sources. How are
					scholars of late antiquity to utilize the hundreds of Syriac verse homilies
					written between the fourth and sixth centuries? They are a tantalizing source
					for social, exegetical, theological, and political historians. Yet, those who
					have tried to harness them have almost always been rebuffed, primarily by an
					inability to gain purchase on the historical con- text of a given homily. </p>
				<p> This is why one of the most exciting contributions of <hi rend="italic"
						>Preaching Christology</hi> is that it offers historians “a new methodology
					for linking homilies to historical investigations” (p. 3), or, as Forness says
					later, it provides historians with “a model to integrate late antique homilies
					into historical narratives of late antiquity” (p. 18). This methodology of
					“tracing key slogans, such as the pairing of miracles and suffering, to debates
					occurring among contemporaneous authors suggests how homilies might be tied to
					historical situations” (p. 21). This methodology underpins the subtle and
					careful philological detective work that clearly demonstrates how the deliberate
						<pb n="419"/> language found in Jacob’s homilies overlaps with his surviving
					epistolary corpus—I say surviving because Forness convinc¬ingly suggests that
					the surviving letter corpus was preserved precisely because of its
					Christological content (p. 90). Using this methodology, Forness capably
					contextualizes Jacob within his late antique milieu, and his sermons within a
					larger world of homiletic discourse. </p>
				<p> The far-reaching significance of Forness’s work is not merely methodological,
					however, but also psychological. After reading his book, the concerns of
					historians about Syriac hom- ilies are allayed. Their fears are calmed, and they
					feel able for the first time to approach this corpus as a potential historical
					source with confidence. This confidence in the richness, com- plexity, and
					scrutability of the early Syriac literary tradition is what distinguishes the
					work of scholars such as Robert Murray, Sebastian Brock, Susan Harvey, Manolis
					Papoutsakis and now, Philip Forness. But historians who hope to undertake a
					similar project may tumble at the first hurdle unless they are prepared to do
					the kind of careful and thorough work that underlies the studies produced by
					these scholars. </p>
				<p> Forness not only provides a new methodological model for historicizing the
					Syriac sermon, but also offers “a new theoretical understanding of the audience
					of sermons” (p. 3). At the heart of this understanding is the idea of two
					audiences, essentially listeners and readers, or, in the work of Lisa Ede and
					Andrea Lunsford that Forness cites at this point, the “audience addressed” and
					the “audience invoked” (pp. 29–30). Here Forness reframes our notion of
					audience. But what work does this reframing do? There is certainly value in
					recognizing that a homily is produced within a particular discursive context
					(30); and understanding the process that stands behind the record¬ing,
					redaction, collection, and circulation of Jacob’s homilies (pp. 41–53) convinces
					us, among other things, that the largest audience of Jacob’s homilies,
					demographically, geographically, and temporally, are the later readers of his
					works in manuscript form. However, with regard to the audience Jacob actually
					preached to, “The available evidence suggests that he had <pb n="420"/> diverse
					audiences, preached throughout a broad geographical area over a long career, and
					delivered homilies in a variety of liturgical settings” (p. 40). So, has Forness
					advanced our knowledge beyond the claim that Jacob preached lots of hom¬ilies to
					lots of different people, in lots of different places and settings? </p>
				<p> To frame the question in this way is, I suspect, to miss the point, since one
					argument of <hi rend="italic">Preaching Christology</hi> is precisely that Jacob
					preached lots of homilies to lots of different people, in lots of different
					places and settings, and therefore he had an almost viral effect on his
					ecclesiastical community in terms of the spread of miaphysite Christology and
					other knowledge. As Forness puts it, “The principal argument of this monograph
					is that preaching served as a means of communicating Christo¬logical concepts to
					broad audiences in late antiquity” (p. 3). Again, in the first chapter he notes
					that, “The most significant claim of this monograph for the study of
					Christianity in late antiquity is that homilies spread knowledge of the
					Christologi¬cal controversies to wide audiences” (p. 27). This claim must be
					qualified of course. Thus, even as Forness says that Jacob’s “homilies served as
					a means of spreading knowledge of Christology to both clergy and laity,” in the
					next paragraph he has to qualify this claim by acknowledging that “few homilies
					in Jacob of Serugh’s corpus engage overtly with the Christo¬logical debates that
					characterize theological discourse in his day” (p. 9). In fact, with Jacob, we
					are working with a corpus of homilies that do not focus on Christological
					debates but do “contain specific criticism of Chalcedonian Christology” (p. 9).
					This makes the project more interesting. Forness’s extensive reading of Jacob’s
					corpus enables him to make a claim about Jacob’s project that is not obvious to
					the casual reader: homi¬lies are doing important cultural and intellectual work.
					Among other things, they are tying both the simple believer and the <pb n="421"/>
					studious reader into the larger contemporary Christological conversations.
					Homilies were thus the primary way that people knew about Christology in late
					antiquity (p. 223). The implications of this observation lead Forness to hope
					that “Homilies may yet transform our understanding of the range of society that
					participated in theological debates” (p. 228). </p>
				<p> The great strength of Forness’s book is that it reveals a Jacob who is
					culturally relevant and intellectually engaged, a product of “vibrant
					intellectual currents” (p. 6), and at the cen¬ter of the big issues of his day.
					He is a thinker whose ideas can be taken seriously. He is also a thinker with
					enormous cultural influence. A thinker who participated “in a discussion of the
					miracles and suffering of Christ that spanned the Roman Empire—and beyond to
					Armenia and the Arabian Peninsula—and across no less than five languages” (88).
						<hi rend="italic">Preaching Christology</hi> is a rich, erudite, clearly
					written, generously documented, wide-ranging, and significant contribution to
					the study of Jacob of Serugh. It is also an essential work for anyone wishing to
					explore the large, diverse, and promising corpus of Syriac sermons from late
					antiquity. </p>

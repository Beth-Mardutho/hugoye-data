                    <p xml:lang="en">As the fourth catholicos of the Church of the East since the rise of Islam
                        (following Ishoʿyahb II [628–645], Maremeh [646–649], and Ishoʿyahb III
                        [649–659]), Gewargis I played an important role in giving his church a new
                        voice under Islam. Submitted as a doctoral dissertation at the Theological
                        Faculty of the University of Göttingen, Catalin-Stefan Popa’s study of this
                        pivotal but often overlooked historical figure makes a significant
                        contribution to the field. It critically presents and contextualizes the
                        available information on Gewargis’ life and elucidates his position as a
                        theologian of the Church of the East. The book is well documented, well
                        presented, and well written. It consists of two parts. The first part deals
                        with Gewargis’ biography and recounts the synod that was held under his
                        leadership on the island of Dirin (nowadays part of Bahrain) (pp. 15–56);
                        the second part offers a detailed analysis of Gewargis’ <hi rend="italic">Letter to Mina</hi> (pp. 59–141), a significant
                        theological exposition in which we encounter Gewargis as an individual
                        author, preacher, and pastor. </p>
                    <p xml:lang="en">Thomas of Marga’s <hi rend="italic">Book of Governors</hi> is our
                        main source for Gewargis’ biography. Hailing from Kafra, in Beth Garmai,
                        Gewargis entered the famous monastery of Beth ʿAbe at a young age, perhaps
                        shortly before 630, where he met and befriended, in a master-disciple
                        relationship, (the later catholicos) Ishoʿyahb III. Gewargis became
                        Ishoʿyahb’s successor, first as metropolitan bishop of Adiabene (in 649)
                        and, following Ishoʿyahb’s death in 659, as catholicos. Gewargis faced two
                        rivals for the patriarchal see. The way in which he was able to silence
                        their claims and maintain power as the sole legitimate catholicos attests,
                        according to the author, to his sense for reconciliation and compromise (p.
                        29).</p>
                    <p xml:lang="en">The Synod of Dirin held in 676 – undoubtedly a highlight in Gewargis’
                        twenty-year long tenure as catholicos – was the concluding part of a
                        visitation that he undertook to the region of Beth Qaṭraye, on the Persian
                        Gulf. As recounted in several letters of Ishoʿyahb III, a revolt had erupted
                        in the middle of the century among the bishops of this region, setting the
                        backdrop for this visitation. Even though the details remain unknown, the
                        synod seems to have succeeded in mitigating the simmering conflict. The
                        elevation of Beth Qaṭraye to the status of a metropolitan bishopric, as
                        attested in the synodal acts, may have been part of the solution
                        (pp. 43–44). It is probable that the synod had a local scope, limited to
                        Beth Qaṭraye (p. 45).</p>
                    <p xml:lang="en">The short report of the synod, followed by a list of nineteen canons, is
                        preserved in the <hi rend="italic">Synodicon Orientale</hi> of the
                        Church of the East (ed. J.-B. Chabot, 1902, 215–226). The first canon urges
                        the bishops and teachers to instruct the faithful in the “healthy faith,”
                        particularly on Sundays and holidays, so that they may stand firm in
                        confronting heretics (<hi rend="italic">heresiyoṭe</hi>). The
                        following canons are principally concerned with organizational matters and
                        aim at raising the disciplinary and moral standards of lay people and
                        clergy. Warnings are issued against Christian women who consider marriage
                        with pagans (<hi rend="italic">ḥanpe</hi> – a term which includes
                        Muslims, pp. 48–52) as well as against men hastening to drink wine in Jewish
                        taverns after the liturgy. </p>
                    <p xml:lang="en">Gewargis’ <hi rend="italic">Letter to Mina</hi>, “priest and
                        chorbishop in the land of the Persians,” written a few years after the
                        synod, in 678/9, follows the report and the canons in the <hi rend="italic">Synodicon</hi> (ed. Chabot, 227–245) and thus must have
                        obtained an authoritative status. While Gewargis offers his reader a very
                        broad outline of the theological positions of his Church, the focus is on
                        the Incarnation and its Christological implications. Gewargis hints at
                        heretical views which might have planted some doubt in Mina’s mind.
                        Interestingly, the letter as it was sent to Mina was written “in the Persian
                        language, which is easy (<hi rend="italic">pshiq</hi>) for you,”
                        and Mina was encouraged to have it read before him “many times” (ed. Chabot,
                        244–245). Regardless of whether in the <hi rend="italic">Synodicon</hi> we are dealing with the Syriac translation of a text
                        originally written in Persian, or with the Syriac draft from which the
                        Persian translation was made, the <hi rend="italic">Letter</hi> –
                        with its theological concepts and specific terminology – is fully embedded
                        in the East Syriac tradition, which to a large extent was based on the
                        writings of Theodore of Mopsuestia and was shaped and transmitted in the
                        East Syriac schools. </p>
                    <p xml:lang="en">Even though the <hi rend="italic">Letter to Mina</hi> has
                        received some attention from modern scholars (most recently D. W. Winkler,
                        in <hi rend="italic">Journal of Eastern Christian Studies</hi> 60
                        [2008], 293–311), the author provides here the most extensive study to date
                        (pp. 69–141). He successively discusses: (1) the doctrine of God; (2) the
                        Trinity; (3) creation, including the important aspect of divine pedagogy;
                        (4) the righteous and prophets of the Old Testament as signposts, or
                        “Hinweisfiguren” (p. 98), on the path to Christ (Abel, Enoch, and Elijah;
                        Noah; Abraham and Jacob; David; Isaiah, Micah, and Malachi); (5)
                        Christology: Christ’s two natures; the concept of “indwelling,” exemplified
                        in John 2:19–22; the union of the two natures; refutation of heretical
                        views, wherein Gewargis insists that the two natures remain separated, that
                        Christ as Savior must be fully human and fully divine, and that, given human
                        hopelessness and bondage to sin, no other way of renewal and salvation would
                        have been possible. Throughout the exposition, Gewargis cites biblical
                        verses from both the Old and New Testament as prooftexts, and he concludes
                        the <hi rend="italic">Letter</hi> with a short florilegium
                        demonstrating that the orthodox faith, as preserved in its purity
                        exclusively in the Church of the East, originally belonged to the universal
                        church. </p>
                    <p xml:lang="en">In the <hi rend="italic">Letter</hi>, as the author observes,
                        Gewargis intended to summarize the faith accessibly and concisely (as Mina
                        had requested), avoiding technical details and not wanting to make an
                        original contribution to the theological tradition of his Church. It is
                        interesting to see, e.g., that in spite of the letter’s Christological
                        focus, Gewargis does not discuss the “two <hi rend="italic">qnome</hi>” in Christ (which led to so much controversy in the time of
                        Babai and Ishoʿyahb II). He simply takes the two <hi rend="italic">qnome</hi> for granted in his use of the expression “two hypostatic
                        natures,” or “zwei qnōmische Naturen” (p. 120: <hi rend="italic">kyane qnomaye</hi>). In addition to the <hi rend="italic">Letter</hi>’s reader-friendliness, Gewargis also frequently uses the
                        pronouns of the first and second person (“I” and “you”), thus intimating
                        that he and his (possibly wavering) correspondent both stand, and should
                        stand, firm in the same community of faith. This faith needs to be defended
                        against different enemies: the Jews, who have an incomplete understanding of
                        God, the <hi rend="italic">ḥanpe</hi> (a moniker here for the
                        Muslims), who are “without God,” and those Christians who have such
                        blasphemous ideas about Christ and the Incarnation that they may be said to
                        be “without God” as well (pp. 127–128). The Miaphysites are doubtless
                        included within this last group. Gewargis’ letter thus stands in the long
                        tradition of rivalry between the Syriac Orthodox and the Church of the East,
                        which started in the early sixth century under the Sasanians and continued
                        into the early Islamic period.</p>
                    <p xml:lang="en">The author brings many valuable insights to this important text. With an
                        abundance of references he situates the text within the East Syriac
                        tradition. With regard to Gewargis’ sources, it is worth noticing that T.
                        Jansma, in his study of Narsai’s homily no. 34 (“On the creation,” ed.
                        Mingana, II, pp. 168–180), was so impressed with the similarity between this
                        homily and a long section in Gewargis’ <hi rend="italic">Letter</hi>, that he regarded the latter as a prose rendering of
                        Narsai’s verse homily, “basé … sur les mêmes idées, et rédigé dans presque
                        les mêmes termes” (“Études sur la pensée de Narsaï,” <hi rend="italic">L’Orient Syrien</hi> 11 [1966], 425–429). One wonders
                        whether among the many parallel texts adduced by the author (in which Narsai
                        features prominently), some special connection between Narsai and Gewargis
                        could be detected. </p>
                    <p xml:lang="en">Biblical commentaries appear to be an underrepresented genre among the
                        sources listed by the author, particularly in the discussion of Gewargis’
                        treatment of the Old Testament. The only reason why Jansma refrained from
                        assuming a direct relationship between Narsai and Gewargis was the quotation
                        of Job 38:7 (in the context of the creation of the light), which is found in
                        Gewargis’ <hi rend="italic">Letter</hi> and, in a similar context,
                        among the Syriac fragments of Theodore’s <hi rend="italic">Commentary on Genesis</hi> edited by E. Sachau (1869), but is absent
                        from Narsai. The same quotation, however, is found in the Diyarbakır <hi rend="italic">Commentary on Genesis</hi> (CSCO 483 / Syr. 205,
                        1986, p. 4). Consultation of this commentary – which may have been composed
                        only a few decades after the <hi rend="italic">Letter to Mina</hi>
                        – might have helped the author in his somewhat convoluted discussion of Job
                        38:7 in Gewargis’ <hi rend="italic">Letter</hi> (pp. 84–87). The
                        same commentary could have shed light on the discussion of the primordial
                        creatures. Gewargis and the Diyarbakır commentator (ed., p. 7) agree that
                        “in the beginning” seven creatures were created in silence: heaven, earth,
                        fire, water, air, darkness, and the angels (for Narsai, see
                        Jansma, 416–417). I believe that the author’s analysis of this question –
                        suggesting a possible discrepancy between Gewargis and the rest of the East
                        Syriac tradition (p. 80) – needs correction.</p>
                    <p xml:lang="en">These minor issues do not affect the overall very fine quality of the book.
                        The author’s deep and well-informed reading and study of the original
                        sources should be welcomed as a major contribution to our knowledge of an
                        important period in the history of the Church of the East.</p>

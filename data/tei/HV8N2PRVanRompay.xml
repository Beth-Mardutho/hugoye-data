         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P1"/>[1] Severus
    of Antioch is one of the most important authors of the
    Syrian-Orthodox and Coptic-Orthodox Churches. According to
    historians of the imperial church he held the patriarchate of
    Antioch from 512 to 518, the year in which he was deposed, at
    the beginning of the reign of the Chalcedonian emperor Justin.
    His followers, however, continued to consider him their
    patriarch until his death in 538. Severus’s leadership,
    which lasted 26 years, was of crucial importance for the
    formation and consolidation of the anti-Chalcedonian,
    Miaphysite movement.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P2"/>[2] While
    Severus wrote his numerous works in Greek, very little has been
    preserved in that language. It is only in recent years that
    Greek fragments, which are preserved in exegetical Catena
    manuscripts, are being systematically published and studied.
    See particularly F. Petit, <hi rend="italic">La chaîne sur
    l’Exode</hi>, I. <hi rend="italic">Fragments de Sévère
    d’Antioche</hi> (Louvain, 1999), with a second volume,
    covering the remaining books of the Octateuch and the books of
    Kings, forthcoming (2006). The gradual loss of interest in
    Severus’s Greek works marks the shift of the
    anti-Chalcedonian movement from the Greek to the Syriac and
    Coptic cultural areas, a shift which took place in the sixth
    and seventh centuries and reached its completion in the early
    Islamic period.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P3"/>[3] In view
    of the loss of the original Greek Severus, the existence of an
    extensive corpus of Syriac translations is all the more
    important. Many of these translations were produced during
    Severus’s lifetime and are preserved in sixth-century
    manuscripts. Even if they do not represent the actual wording
    of Severus’s original writings, they give us access to
    the milieu of the mid-sixth-century anti-Chalcedonians in Syria
    and Egypt, many of whom were bilingual (Greek and Syriac or
    Coptic), and many of whom were instrumental in shaping what
    would later become the Syrian-Orthodox and the Coptic-Orthodox
    Churches. Compared to the importance of the Syriac transmission
    of Severus’s works, the Coptic evidence is much more
    modest, although it once may have been significant. From Coptic
    and Syriac, Severus’s name and fame became part of
    Christian-Arabic literature, from which his legacy later
    reached Ethiopia. The Arabic and Ethiopic fields have not yet
    been fully explored, even though remarkable progress has been
    made in recent years. Youhanna Nessim Youssef’s 2004
    edition and translation of an Arabic Life of Severus,
    corresponding to the Ge’ez version published by E. J.
    Goodspeed in 1909, may be singled out: <hi rend="italic">The Arabic Life of
    Severus of Antioch Attributed to Athanasius of Antioch</hi>
    (Patrologia Orientalis, 49,4; Turnhout, 2004).</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P4"/>[4] The
    present volume, which is edited by Pauline Allen and C. T. R.
    Hayward, is a most welcome one, as several of Severus’s
    works have remained relatively little-known in the English
    speaking world. One finds here long excerpts from various
    works, most of them newly translated. The translations are by:
    Robert Hayward (Texts 1-15: extracts from various theological
    works and Cathedral Homilies, nos. 13 and 14; Text 17: Homily
    no. 72; and Texts 18-25 and 27-28: extracts from various
    letters), Iain Torrance (Text 16: Homily no. 18), Witold
    Witakowski (Texts 29-34: Hymns), and Pauline Allen (Text 26:
    fragment from a letter). The omission of the translators’
    names from the respective chapters and from the Table of
    contents is misleading and unfortunate.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P5"/>[5] Except
    for text no. 26 (ten lines from Greek), all other translations
    are from Syriac. The English translations are particularly
    welcome for Severus’s theological works, which have been
    published mostly with Latin translations, and for his homilies,
    the editions of which are accompanied by French translations.
    To my knowledge, one more homily has been translated into
    English, namely no. 52 (On the Maccabees), in R. L. Bensly,
    <hi rend="italic">The Fourth Book of Maccabees and Kindred Documents in
    Syriac</hi> (Cambridge, 1895), p. xxvii-xxxiv. As for
    Severus’s letters, most of these have been published by
    E. W. Brooks (in 1902-1904 and in 1916-1920, respectively) with
    excellent English translations, which these new translations do
    not substantially improve. The dossier of letters exchanged
    between Severus and a certain Sergius (after 518), published
    and translated into Latin by J. Lebon in 1949 (CSCO 119-120 /
    Syr. 64-65), was made available in English by Iain R. Torrance
    in his <hi rend="italic">Christology after Chalcedon. Severus of Antioch and
    Sergius the Monophysite</hi> (Norwich, 1988), 143-236, an
    important complement to the theological texts translated in the
    present volume.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P6"/>[6] The
    first three chapters of the book provide well-written
    introductions to (1) Severus’s life, (2) Severus’s
    thought, and (3) Severus’s works. In the broader
    historical sketch of the Miaphysite resistance to the Council
    of Chalcedon one might have preferred to see a bit more nuance
    in the description of Justinian and Theodora in their alleged
    roles of opponent and supporter of the anti-Chalcedonians,
    respectively. It is also incorrect, I think, to see in John of
    Tella’s ordinations of priests in the late 520s the birth
    of “a separatist and independent church” (p. 28).
    The Miaphysites’ alienation and separation from the
    imperial church should rather be seen as a gradual process,
    spanning the entire sixth and even part of the seventh
    centuries.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P7"/>[7] Building
    upon earlier studies by J. Lebon (1951), R. Chesnut (1976), A.
    Grillmeier (1995), and I. Torrance (1988), a laudable effort is
    made here to analyze, understand, and contextualize some basic
    ideas of Severus’s theology, which is profoundly
    Cyrillian (p. 34-38). In view of this, the following statement,
    which serves as a conclusion, is unsatisfactory (p. 37-38):
    “Despite the orthodox language in which such
    soteriological principles are enunciated by Severus and other
    monophysites, it is difficult to escape the impression that it
    was not only Julian of Halicarnassus who believed that, while
    Christ was a true human being, he was not an ordinary one. The
    interpenetration of the two natures results in a dominance of
    the divine nature in the union, and the exchange of properties
    (<hi rend="italic">communicatio idiomatum</hi>) seems one-sided.” Not
    only is the use of the term “orthodox” problematic
    in this context, but the application of a non-Miaphysite
    “orthodox” meta-discourse introduces a theological
    prejudice that hampers historical understanding.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P8"/>[8]
    “The Early Church Fathers” series has so far
    produced  a number of important volumes. Severus of
    Antioch, who was one of the protagonists in a period of intense
    theological discussion and stood at the intersection of the
    Greek and Syriac worlds, has a well-deserved place in it. The
    highly readable translations provided in this volume will
    further increase awareness and understanding of this important
    tradition within early Christianity.</p>

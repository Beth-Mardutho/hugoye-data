         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P1"/>[1] In an
    earlier issue of this periodical we made a first attempt to
    survey the Syriac manuscript tradition of the <hi rend="italic">Acts of
    Thecla</hi> and to bring together various pieces of information
    illuminating the popularity of the <hi rend="italic">Acts</hi> as well as of
    the cult of Thecla in Syria [<ref target="../Vol5No2/HV5N2BurrisVanRompay.html">Burris &amp; Van Rompay 2002</ref>]. By
    doing so, we intended to pave the way for a more comprehensive
    study in the future, comparable to Stephen Davis' treatment of
    the Thecla cult in Egypt [Davis 2001]. After the completion of
    our earlier paper, a few more interesting data have come to our
    attention which we would like to present here briefly.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P2"/>[2] Several
    of the data listed earlier are datable to the sixth century.
    Two manuscripts of the <hi rend="italic">Acts</hi> originated in the sixth
    century, Severus' homily on Thecla can be situated between 512
    and 518, and the explicit reference to the <hi rend="italic">Acts of
    Thecla</hi> in the <hi rend="italic">Life of Febronia</hi> probably belongs to
    the late sixth or to the early seventh century. Most of our new
    data can be related to the sixth century as well.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P3"/>[3] First,
    we return to Severus of Antioch, Syrian-Orthodox patriarch from
    512 to 518, whose homily no. 97, delivered on Thecla's feast
    day (September 24), was briefly analyzed earlier. It is
    apparent in this homily that Severus was familiar with the
    Thecla shrine in Seleucia, where healings and miracles were
    performed. Now we can offer further evidence of that
    familiarity. Among the letters of Severus translated into
    Syriac in 668/69 by Athanasius of Nisibis, a letter is
    preserved, written to Solon, metropolitan bishop of Seleucia.
    The letter belongs to the period prior to Severus' election as
    patriarch, probably to the year 511 (shortly after the death of
    Bishop Constantine, Solon's predecessor). Like Constantine,
    Solon was an anti-Chalcedonian and turned to Severus for advice
    and encouragement. In his letter, Severus urged him to stand
    firm in the orthodox faith, thereby referring to the patron
    saint of Solon's city: "But assuredly the honorable in
    virginity and first of female martyrs, and skilled maker of
    these things, I mean the holy Thecla, will clothe you in such
    raiment to do honor to her vote concerning you."[Brooks I,1,
    1902, 12-13 - Brooks' translation: II,1, 1903, 12]. Solon's
    successor, Stephen, who must have been an anti-Chalcedonian in
    the beginning, but later, probably during the Chalcedonian
    restoration under Justin I (518-527), joined the imperial
    church, is explicitly mentioned as a Chalcedonian bishop in 532
    [Honigmann 1951, 85-88; Brock 1981, 117]. The Chalcedonian
    confession of the city's bishop did not detract from the
    sanctity of the shrine, and does not necessarily imply that
    anti-Chalcedonian worshippers would have lacked any access to
    it. In a much later letter Severus, writing about martyr
    shrines in general, expressed himself as follows: "Where the
    bones of holy martyrs have previously (i.e., before the
    Chalcedonians were in control) been laid, it is right to pray
    without hesitation: especially when the place is in silence,
    and the heretics (i.e., the Chalcedonians) are not unlawfully
    conducting services or singing inside." [Brooks I,2, 1904, 305
    - Brooks' translation: II,2, 1904, 271]</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P4"/>[4] Our
    second reference is more loosely connected to Severus. A hymn
    devoted to Thecla is preserved in a collection which originally
    can be traced back to Severus, but which later was expanded to
    include hymns written by others. The original Greek collection
    was translated into Syriac by Paul of Edessa in the early
    seventh century. Paul's translation was thoroughly revised on
    the basis of Greek manuscripts in the year 674/75 by Jacob of
    Edessa, who for many words inserted alternative translations
    above the line, marked Paul's interpolations with red, and
    added all kinds of notes (a number of them dealing with
    scriptural references). It is only in Jacob's revised version
    that the work has survived. In his final note, Jacob says that
    two hundred and ninety-five (among the three hundred and
    sixty-five) hymns are by Severus and that the remaining hymns
    are by different authors. For those hymns that do not have an
    author's name it is impossible to ascertain whether or not they
    go back to Severus.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P5"/>[5] The
    collection of hymns has a small section devoted to "Holy
    martyrs who were martyred from among women". It contains hymns
    on Thecla, Drusis (two hymns), Euphemia, and Pelagia. The Hymn
    on Thecla deserves to be quoted in full [Brooks II, 1911,
    620[208]-621[209] - Brooks' translation is largely followed
    here].</p>

    </quote>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P6"/>[6] Jacob's
    notes include a number of variants which do not affect the
    content of the text. Jacob also provides the reference to the
    Gospel of Luke, to which he adds a brief commentary. As for the
    two main terms used with regard to Thecla, "evangelist"
    (<hi rend="italic">msabbronito</hi>) and "apostolic"
    (<hi rend="italic">šli<!--<u>-->h<!--</u>-->oyto</hi>, apparently a substantivized
    adjective), no variant is provided. Each of the sentences of
    the hymn refers to a specific event in the <hi rend="italic">Acts</hi>, while
    the main lesson for later Christians seems to be that of
    chastity.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P7"/>[7] Since
    the hymn on Thecla, like the other hymns on female martyrs, is
    anonymous, we are unable to ascertain whether Severus or a
    later sixth-century poet is its author. We may assume that the
    Thecla hymn was part of the Greek collection when Paul
    translated it into Syriac and that Jacob of Edessa still found
    it in the Greek manuscripts which he used in his revision
    work.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P8"/>[8] A
    further most interesting reference to Thecla is found in the
    biography of John of Tella, one of the leaders of the
    anti-Chalcedonian movement in Syria after Severus' exile to
    Egypt. Born in 483, John was elected as bishop of Tella in 519.
    According to his biographer, Elijah (who wrote shortly after
    542), John was of a well-off family in Callinicus (present-day
    Raqqaʿ in Syria). He lost his father at an
    early age and was raised by his mother and local priests until
    he was given a <hi rend="italic">paidagogos</hi> when he was twenty. Under the
    influence of a local monk, he decided to lead an ascetic life,
    but his mother was able to persuade him to come back home. A
    second experience, however, decisively turned him away from the
    world [Brooks 1907, 42,15-43,2]:</p>
         <quote>
      And one day he took the book of the history of the blessed
      Thecla (<hi rend="italic">ktobo d-tašʿito
      d-<!--<u>-->t<!--</u>-->ubonito Taqla</hi>), who became the disciple of the
      blessed Apostle, and he was reading in it. And since he was a
      chosen vessel (Acts 9:15) and had not been struck by the
      burning arrows of the Evil one (Eph. 6:16), like the rest of
      the young men of his age who did not accept instruction, and
      (since he) was not ensnared by worldly desires, because he
      had been preserved by the divine grace as well as by the
      vigilance of his educators, the love of Christ settled with
      fervor in his soul. And he immediately took (the book of) the
      blessed Apostle and he was reading in it diligently. And as
      soon as in truth he had become a disciple of the blessed
      Apostle, like the blessed Thecla, he built in his apartment a
      small upper room and spent there all his time ... (in order
      to practice ascetic life).
    </quote>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P9"/>[9] The
    reading of the <hi rend="italic">Acts of Thecla</hi> is presented here, in
    early-sixth century Callinicus, as the decisive factor which
    made John turn away from a worldly career and opt for a radical
    ascetic life. This brings to mind a parallel story in the
    <hi rend="italic">Life of Eugenia</hi>, set near Alexandria, in which the
    reading of the Thecla narrative is at the origin of Eugenia's
    immediate and radical change of life (Davis 2001, 143-148, with
    references to the different versions of the <hi rend="italic">Life</hi>,
    including the Syriac one). Our new example shows that such
    effects were not the privilege of women, but also could be
    experienced by men!</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P10"/>[10]
    Finally, an indirect witness to the prominent position of the
    <hi rend="italic">Acts of Thecla</hi> in Syriac Christianity may be seen in the
    Armenian version of the <hi rend="italic">Acts</hi>. Already in 1896, Conybeare
    suggested that the Armenian text was based on a Syriac rather
    than on a Greek original [Conybeare 1896, 54-55 and 59].
    Valentina Calzolari, who prepares a new edition, has recently
    confirmed this suggestion. The translation most likely may be
    traced back to the early fifth century, while the figure of
    Thecla starts being incorporated into original Armenian
    literature from the late fifth century onwards (Calzolari 1996
    and Calzolari 1997).</p>

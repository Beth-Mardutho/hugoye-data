    with English translation, of the certificate of episcopal
    consecration given to Mar Julius Alvares, a Roman Catholic
    priest who joined the Syrian Orthodox Church in 1894. The text

    summer of 2001, two late nineteenth-century documents were
    brought to my attention. The first one is a letter dated Feb
    10, 1894<note place="foot" xml:id="FN1" n="1">

             It is not clear if this is a Julian or Gregorian
    date. Patriarch Peter III dated his communications, even during
    his visit to London, using the Julian calendar. It is not known
    to me if Syriac communications sent from British-controlled
    India used the Julian or Gregorian reckoning.

    subject of this brief paper, contains the text of an original

    the Syrian Orthodox Church and was consecrated
    metropolitan—Mor Julius, bishop of Ceylon, Goa and India
    excluding Malabar. This original copy was sent to Patriarch
    Peter in Mardin for the Patriarchal records. Both documents
    once belonged to the Patriarchal archive located in the Church
    of the Forty Martyrs in Mardin.<note place="foot" xml:id="FN4" n="4">

             The Patriarchal archive in Mardin contains many

            <anchor corresp="P2"/>[2] A
    cursory Internet search on "Julius Alvares" gives numerous
    pages. Hardly anything is mentioned about Alvares in these
    pages; he is simply listed in a line of succession of the
    Patriarchs of Antioch, beginning with St. Peter and ending with
    one <hi rend="italic">episcopus vagans</hi> or another. Such <hi rend="italic">episcopi
    vagantes</hi> claim titles like 'patriarch,' 'catholicos,'
    'metropolitan,' etc., sometimes in combination (e.g., one
    Joseph Vredenburgh of Saint Thomas Christian Church, not to be
    confused with the Mar Thoma Church of Kerala, claims the title
    "Maran Mar Timotheus Josephus Narsi, Catholicos
    Patriarch.")<note place="foot" xml:id="FN5" n="5">

         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P3"/>[3] While
    the consecration of Alvares to the episcopate cannot be
    challenged, his connection with the line of succession of such
    'wandering bishops' is due to his involvement in bringing one
    Joseph René Vilatte to the fold of the Syrian church and
    in having him consecrated, also within the bounds of canon law,
    to the episcopate in 1892 in Colombo. It was Alvares, together
    with Mar Athanasius Paulos (d. 1907), Bishop of Kottayam, and
    Mar Gregorius Gewargis (d. 1902), Bishop of Niranam (and later
    of Thumpamon), who consecrated Vilatte in 1892 and named him
    "Mar Timotheos, Metropolitan of North America," most probably
    with the blessings of Patriarch Peter. Later, Vilatte took it
    upon himself to single-handedly consecrate other bishops,
    contrary to canon law, which resulted in his excommunication
    from the Syrian Orthodox Church. The bishops consecrated by
    Vilatte themselves started consecrating other bishops. Already
    in 1964, over 25 churches in America, Europe and Africa claimed
    the Vilatte succession.<note place="foot" xml:id="FN6" n="6">

            <anchor corresp="P4"/>[4] Vilatte
    and his successors have always been challenged by Rome and
    Canterbury (as well as by the Episcopal Church in America) to
    produce the bull of Patriarch Peter sanctioning the
    consecration, and the certificate of consecration given to
    Vilatte in their original Syriac form. Vilatte's successors
    have only been able to produce alleged English translations of
    both documents. A note given by Patriarch Afram I Barsoum to
    Mor Athanasius Yeshu Samuel upon his departure to the United
    States as Patriarchal Legate in 1949, in which Barsoum gives
    instructions and advice to his legate, states that Vilatte had
    lost his Syriac certificate. (Earlier, on December 10, 1938,
    Patriarch Barsoum, probably at the request of the Church of
    England, issued a statement in which he denied any relation
    with all schismatic bodies of the Vilatte line.<note place="foot" xml:id="FN7" n="7">

    discovery of the certificate of consecration given to Alvares
    sheds some light on what the original Syriac of Vilatte's
    certificate may have looked like. In what follows, I give the
    Syriac text of the certificate of Alvares. I then give my
    English translation of the same, aligning it vertically with
    the published text of the English translation of the Vilatte
    certificate.<note place="foot" xml:id="FN8" n="8">

                    <p xml:lang="en">Bishop Rabbula of Edessa († 435)
                        can be compared with John Chrysostom († 407). Both men were born into the
                        Greek-speaking élite of the most hellenized part of Roman Syria and educated
                        accordingly, both made it their objective “to suppress abuses and reform
                        society, so as to bring it into a more faithful observance of the precepts
                        of the gospel” (A.-M. Malingrey on the latter). But whereas Chrysostom
                        encountered powerful opposition at Constantinople and ended his life in
                        exile, Rabbula dominated his city right up to his death. Few bishops have
                        been such uncompromising advocates of a society in which poverty is honoured
                        above riches. Rabbula claims the attention of all who suspect that Jesus
                        aspired to radical social reform and actually said “Blessed are the poor,”
                        which his more worldly followers later qualified as “Blessed are the poor
                            <hi rend="italic">in spirit</hi>.”</p>
                    <p xml:lang="en">Phenix and Horn set out to provide a more or less
                        comprehensive source-book for the study of Rabbula. They have called it “The
                        Rabbula Corpus,” which is perhaps a little misleading. There is indeed,
                        preserved in a sixth-century manuscript, such a body of texts: “The Heroic
                        Deeds of Bishop Rabbula of Edessa” with its three appendices: Rabbula’s rule
                        for his clergy, his rule for the monks of his diocese and an anti-Nestorian
                        homily (in Syriac), which he is alleged to have delivered in the presence of
                        Nestorius himself at Constantinople. This fifth-century kernel has
                        snowballed, since the nineteenth century, into the much fuller source-book
                        under review. Phenix and Horn build on the corpora assembled by Overbeck and
                        Bickell.</p>

                        of further canons and correspondence before the “Homily” and, after it, of
                        “supplications” (texts to be sung at prayer) attributed to Rabbula.<note

                                “The Heroic Deeds of Bishop Rabbula” tells his reader, in §47, that
                                he is already engaged in a project to translate from Greek into
                                Syriac forty-six letters which Rabbula wrote “to ordained clergy,
                                crowned heads, powerful men and monks.” This statement probably
                                inspired Overbeck to include the Syriac texts of correspondence
                                between Rabbula and three bishops (see No. 6).</p></note> He does
                        not translate the Syriac texts. Bickell rolls the snowball further, picking
                        up the passage on Rabbula’s conversion from the <hi rend="italic">Life</hi>
                        of Alexander Akoimetes; but his German translations are printed without the

                        formation as a theologian must have been Antiochene, because his masters
                        were Eusebius of Chalcis and Acacius of Aleppo, the latter a close associate
                        of Theodoret. Ibas’ claim that Rabbula was once an avid reader of Theodore
                        of Mopsuestia is therefore plausible. It does not occur to either Blum or
                        Phenix and Horn that the Syriac “translation” of the homily (not extant in
                        Greek) allegedly delivered at Constantinople, which takes a bold
                        anti-Nestorian stance, is an answer to the charge that Rabbula must once
                        have been a supporter of Nestorius. Indeed, who else but Nestorius can have
                        invited him to preach in Haghia Sophia during that patriarch’s reign? At
                        Ephesus in 431, Rabbula set his signature to the deposition of Cyril; only
                        afterwards, when the emperor’s support for Cyril became known, did Rabbula
                        “distance (<hi rend="italic">separavit</hi>) himself from the Oriental
                        synod” and become, overnight, an ardent supporter of Cyril and a slanderer
                        of the great exegete Theodore and his disciple, Nestorius, thereby avoiding
                        the fate of Chrysostom. Drijvers does justice to all the sources; yet his
                        arguments are passed over in silence. Blum argues that Rabbula’s signatures
                        at Ephesus were forged and that he must have stayed at home. This unlikely
                        theory, supported by no good evidence, becomes, for Phenix and Horn, “the
                            <hi rend="italic">fact</hi> that Rabbula was not present at the Council
                        of Ephesus” (p. clxxi, reviewer’s emphasis).</p>
                    <p xml:lang="en">The authors speak of “the stunning silences in the <hi
                            rend="italic">Life of Rabbula</hi>” (p. xviii). They do not appreciate
                        the full significance of the encomiast’s silence about Rabbula’s role at
                        Ephesus in 431. If he never put his name to the deposition of Cyril, the
                        record ought to have been set straight by his apologist. Instead, the
                        ecumenical council, like other awkward subjects, is avoided altogether. Much
                        of his praise for Rabbula can be read as indirect criticism of his
                        successor, Ibas, under whom the encomiast probably wrote. The famous schools
                        of the city, including that of the Christians from Persia, of which Ibas was
                        the head, are only mentioned in passing; indeed, Phenix and Horn mistake the
                        word ܡܟ̈ܬܒܐ (Overbeck, p. 190, line 7), which is probably to be translated
                        as “schools” (though Doran, p. 89, penult., has “those inscribed on the
                        welfare rolls”), for ܡ̈ܟܬܒܢܐ “scribes,” so even this passing reference is
                        missed.</p>

                                would have claimed it as proof of God’s dissatisfaction with the new

                                the conclusion.</p></note> that, already before the flood of 413,
                        Rabbula had converted the synagogue of the Jews into the church of St
                        Stephen. (He did not need to replace the foundations, so built nothing “<hi
                            rend="italic">in</hi> the earth”!) Far from acknowledging this, the
                        encomiast is at pains to say how well Rabbula got on with the Jews of his
                        city and how bitterly these outsiders – more honestly characterized in §42
                        as “the obstinate Israelite people” – mourned the dead bishop. Phenix and
                        Horn (following Hallier, Blum and Doran) take this at face value. But the
                        church-leaders of Syria are not to be trusted when they claim to have the
                        best interests of the Jews at heart. One only has to remember Rabbula’s
                        fourth-century models: the bishop who orchestrated (with impunity) the
                        destruction of the synagogue of Callinicus, Chrysostom and (not least)
                        Ephrem. Rabbula’s contemporary, Barṣauma of Samosata, was not the only one
                        to intimidate judges and even royalty when they dared defend the downtrodden
                            Jews.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn13" n="13"><p rend="footnote text">

                        blessed is the Messiah (this should be “Blessed is Christ”) who intoxicated
                        the holy martyrs with the blood (“made the holy martyrs drunk on the blood”
                        – the word “intoxicated” is taken from the wrong register) from his

                    <p xml:lang="en">The English translations by Phenix and Horn, as
                        published, are neither felicitous, nor accurate. For a revised edition they
                        need to be thoroughly overhauled. An example will be given here from the
                        most important source, “The Heroic Deeds of Bishop Rabbula.” In §46 the
                        anonymous encomiast refers his reader to the Syriac translation of the
                        homily delivered in Constantinople. This reference will be quoted here,
                        first in Syriac (fol. 115v, Overbeck, p. 198f., Phenix and Horn, p. 68),
                        then in Bickell’s German translation, then in Robert Doran’s English
                        translation, and finally in the translation given in <hi rend="italic">The
                            Rabbula Corpus</hi>, so as to allow readers of this review to judge for
                        themselves which is the best of the English translations.</p>

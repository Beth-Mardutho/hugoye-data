         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P1"/>[1] The
    third incarnation or edition of a small volume of verses of
    Isaac of Nineveh selected by Sebastian Brock is more than a
    reprinting, but an innovation in Syriac publishing.  The
    first life of this selection originated in Kottayam, India, as
    a 1995 publication of the St. Ephrem Ecumenical Research
    Institute; the second included a longer introduction in an
    attractive edition by SLG Press, Fairacres, Oxford (1997,
    1999).  In this third Gorgias Press edition, the book
    continues being fleshed out with the longer introduction, an
    updated bibliography, and in particular a facing-page Syriac
    text. Another dimension is added with Brock’s
    introduction being translated into Syriac by Raban Awgen
    Aydin—recently consecrated as Mar Polycarpus Eugene
    Aydin, Bishop of the Netherlands, Diocese of the Syrian
    Orthodox Church.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P2"/>[2] It is as
    much the concept of this text as its content that is
    significant. George Kiraz and Gorgias Press have initiated
    a new series of bilingual texts in order to make available
    edited texts and excellent English translations at low
    cost. Fittingly, Sebastian Brock’s selection of
    Isaac of Nineveh is Volume One, a throwback to an older style
    of a selected reader for spiritual development and
    guidance.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P3"/>[3] Brock
    has chosen 153 sayings or <hi rend="italic">mēllē</hi> from the
    First and Second Parts of Isaac’s works. The number, of
    course, is the count of the post-resurrection catch of fish by
    the disciples (John 21), utilized by other early Christian
    writers especially for similar collections of pithy sentences
    or chapters intended for memorization and meditation.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P4"/>[4] The
    introduction presents a thorough, yet concise, summary of what
    is known of Isaac’s life and the longer story of his
    writings, emphasizing its wide spiritual influence first in
    Syriac, then in Greek and Russian spirituality.  The
    journey of Isaac’s works into the <hi rend="italic">Philokalia</hi> are
    detailed, as well as the description of the traditional First
    Part, the rediscovery in the Bodleian Library of the Second
    Part, and a brief note on the even more recent discovery of the
    Third Part.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P5"/>[5]
    Describing the content of this collection of short texts is a
    problem since there is no narrative or overarching scheme for
    the sentences. Since the sentences are intended for
    purposes of meditation, one does not want to give too many
    away.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P6"/>[6] For the
    student of Syriac patristics and the seeker of Eastern
    Christian spirituality there are further benefits. One is
    able to observe how Brock translates with his deep
    understanding of how this language functions. The English
    translation is always contemporary in tone, occasionally edging
    toward the colloquial, so consequently needing little
    explanation for one desiring to meditate upon the sentences.
    The sentences generally focus upon the attitudes of human
    beings towards prayer and its practice, and conversely, upon
    God’s compassionate attitude towards us. A few
    examples will illustrate.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P7"/>[7] The
    first sentence is of interest to see where Brock begins. 
    From the second homily of the First Part Isaac speaks
    appropriately of a spiritual progression and journey - ladder
    and steps, descending and ascending.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P8"/>[8]
    1. “The ladder to the Kingdom is hidden within you,
    and within your soul.  Dive down into your self, away from
    sin, and there you will find the steps by which you can ascend
    up.”</p>

     Sebastian Brock has spoken and written of the need for
    “haute vulgarisation” of Syriac literature in order
    to promote the field among a wider audience than just
    specialists and thus help integrate awareness of the Syriac
    tradition as “the third lung” for the Church. 
    This slim volume certainly fills this imperative, particularly
    in its accessibility.</p>

            <p>This article highlights Coptic-Syriac
    relations in ways beyond the theological position of both
    churches. It focuses on the relationship between Copts and
    Syrians depicted in the Coptic Synaxarium. It includes a
    discussion of Syrian saints, Syrians who became patriarchs of
    the Coptic Church, and their role in the liturgical and
    devotional changes that occurred. After the Arab conquest, both
    churches came to share a common language – Arabic. This
    led to an exchange of theological terms. This shared
    theological language and the Syrian presence in the Coptic
    Synaxarium strengthened the relations between the two churches
    in ways beyond ecclesial politics.</p>

         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P1"/>[1] The
    Coptic and Syriac Orthodox churches have a long common history.
    They are two of the oldest churches of Christianity, with large
    literatures in Greek, Syriac, Coptic, and later in Arabic. They
    shared the Roman hegemony – not only the entanglements of
    Roman law, but also imperial persecutions. They benefited from
    the Greek <hi rend="italic">paideia</hi>. They were intellectually enriched
    by having their patriarchal residences and presence in cities
    that were hubs of the cultural and commercial centers of the
    Roman Empire, i.e. the cities of Alexandria and Antioch.
    Although modern scholars have portrayed the theological history
    of both churches as a struggle of Antiochene theology against
    Alexandrian and vice versa, the reality is that each
    theological group read and thoroughly understood each
    other’s literature. Both churches agreed to disagree with
    the Chalcedonian expression of faith. Both churches shared the
    same suffering to preserve this faith. They shared successive
    invasions by the Persians and then the Arabs. The Arab invasion
    led to the isolation of both churches from the rest of western
    Christendom. It forced both churches to change their
    theological languages from Greek, Coptic, and Syriac to Arabic.
    The Syrian Church was a pioneer in this translation process.
    The Coptic Church eventually became the most productive church
    of Christian Arabic literature. Both churches confronted the
    religious challenges of Islam. Religious debates took place in
    rulers’ palaces as well as among the common lay people.
    This led to the production of a rich Christian-Islamic dialogue
    that preceded the attempts of the West by centuries. Since
    then, their common political situation converged more than
    ever. The Turks, then later the French and the British
    conquered both peoples. These layers of foreign hegemony
    greatly affected the religious expression and religious
    struggle of both churches. The Turkish, French and British
    occupations are a part of their history, and the Arab presence
    remains a reality.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P2"/>[2] However,
    scholarly research in the West has tended to focus only on a
    few specific aspects of this shared patrimony. Topics of
    interest include the non-Chalcedonian faith that both churches
    have in common;<ref target="#FN1">1</ref> also the library and wall paintings in the
    Syrian Monastery (Deir el-Surian) located in the Egyptian
    desert of Wadi el-Natrun.<ref target="#FN2">2</ref> Individuals of interest include
    Severus of Antioch and his interlocutor the neo-Chalcedonian
    John the Grammarian;<ref target="#FN3">3</ref> also, John Philoponus, a philosopher and
    non-Chalcedonian theologian of the sixth century and Julian of
    Halicarnassus.<ref target="#FN4">4</ref> The focus of this paper is on other aspects of
    this shared patrimony: the strong Syrian presence in the Coptic
    Synaxarium and the theological terminology in Arabic shared by
    both Churches.<ref target="#FN5">5</ref> This is followed by a brief discussion of the
    exchange of theological terms after both Churches came to share
    Arabic as a common language. The approach of this paper is from
    the Coptic perspective.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P3"/>[3] The
    Synaxarium is a liturgical book that recounts the lives of the
    saints venerated by the Coptic Church. A chapter of the
    Synaxarium is read daily in the liturgy after the readings of
    the Praxis, or the Book of Acts, and before the Gospel reading.
    The simple narrative of the Coptic Synaxarium delivers a
    powerful message to the people. The first edition of the
    Synaxarium was compiled by three bishops, Bishop Peter, bishop
    of Melig (ˆdgl), Bishop Michael, bishop of Atrib (FdvjH),
    and Bishop John, bishop of Borolus (Sgvfgh). According to the
    Synaxarium Bishop John became a monk and disciple of St.
    Daniel, the hegemon (o` h`gou,menoj) of the Nitrian
    Desert.<ref target="#FN6">6</ref> St. Daniel was born in AD 485 and ordained the
    hegemon over the Nitrean Desert in AD 535. During
    Daniel’s priestly tenure as the hegemon, Emperor
    Justinian promulgated laws that strongly enforced Chalcedonian
    dogmas. Daniel’s opposition to these laws caused him
    great suffering.<ref target="#FN7">7</ref> The first collection of saints’ lives, or
    the nucleus of the book of the Synaxarium, seems to have been
    composed during the sixth century AD, with additions and
    revisions into the twelfth and thirteenth centuries.<ref target="#FN8">8</ref> The
    escalation of the Chalcedonian controversy might have been a
    significant factor in the compilation of the Synaxarium in an
    attempt to preserve the saints’ heritage in the Coptic
    memory. The Copts have been accustomed to listen to the stories
    of the saints during the liturgy as part of the readings
    revered by the church from very early times.<ref target="#FN9">9</ref>
         </p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P4"/>[4] The
    Synaxarium contains fifty-five accounts related to Syrian
    saints or to the Syrian Church. The Copts are reminded of the
    close relationship between the Syrian and Coptic Churches,
    since at least one such Synaxarium account per week is read in
    the Coptic liturgy. Of the fifty-five accounts, four take place
    during the time of Chalcedon,<ref target="#FN10">10</ref> five are
    post-Chalcedonian,<ref target="#FN11">11</ref> another five concern Patriarch Severus of
    Antioch,<ref target="#FN12">12</ref> three mention an exchange of letters of faith
    between Coptic and Syrian patriarchs,<ref target="#FN13">13</ref> two are dated
    after the Arab invasion,<ref target="#FN14">14</ref> two others do not have a clear
    date,<ref target="#FN15">15</ref> and the remaining thirty-two accounts deal
    with pre-Chalcedonian events.<ref target="#FN16">16</ref> More than half of the
    accounts are related to pre- Chalcedonian saints or events.
    There are only thirteen Synaxarium accounts for Persian saints,
    two for Armenian saints,<ref target="#FN17">17</ref> one for a saint who died in
    India,<ref target="#FN18">18</ref> and one for an Ethiopian saint.<ref target="#FN19">19</ref> Although the
    Armenian, Indian, and Ethiopian Churches share the same
    theological confession, the Syrian Church maintains a special
    relationship with the Alexandrian Church.<ref target="#FN20">20</ref>
         </p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P5"/>[5] The most
    commemorated Syrian saint in the Synaxarium is Severus of
    Antioch. On the second of <hi style="color:red; font-family:CopticSSK">O`noh</hi> (Paopi) the
    entry of the Synaxarium commemorates the coming of St. Severus
    to Egypt.<ref target="#FN21">21</ref> The Synaxarium account tells that Severus was
    forced to flee to Egypt during the reign of Emperor Justinian
    upon the advice of Empress Theodora.<ref target="#FN22">22</ref> It then describes
    his stay in Egypt by a story that indicates that although
    Severus was travelling incognito, the Lord always recognized
    his priestly status, wherever he was. The story goes as
    follows: One day Severus, disguised as a monk, attended a
    liturgy in a church in the Nitrian desert. When the priest
    raised the <hi rend="italic">prospherein</hi> he could not find the
    <hi rend="italic">qorban</hi> to be consecrated.<ref target="#FN23">23</ref> The priest addressed the
    congregation saying that the <hi rend="italic">qorban</hi> had disappeared
    because of sin, either his own or that of the congregation. At
    this moment, everyone in the church began crying and praying,
    asking for God’s forgiveness. An angel of the Lord
    appeared to the priest to inform him that it was not
    anyone’s fault but rather it was because the sacrifice
    was offered in the presence of a patriarch. As the highest
    ranking member of the priestly hierarchy present in church, the
    patriarch was supposed to say the prayers of consecration. The
    angel pointed to Severus who was sitting at the far end of the
    church. He was brought with great honor to the altar, and only
    then the <hi rend="italic">qorban</hi> became present on the paten on the
    altar, thus making it possible for the liturgy to proceed. The
    message delivered by the narrative clearly indicates that
    Severus’ patriarchal rank was recognized by God despite
    imperial opposition, and theological disputes did not affect
    his priesthood. According to the narrative, Severus went to
    Sakha (<hi style="color:red; font-family:Iqraa">ƒos</hi>) after this
    incident and stayed at the house of an archon by the name of
    Dorotheos, and remained there until the time of his death.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P6"/>[6] The
    entry of <hi style="color:red; font-family:CopticSSK">Unh`i</hi> 10 (Koiahk),
    continues the story from where it had stopped at the second of
    <hi style="color:red; font- family:CopticSSK">O`noh</hi>
    (Paopi), two months earlier. Some time after the burial of
    Severus in Sakha, his relics were translated to the Pateron
    Monastery to the west of Alexandria.<ref target="#FN24">24</ref> Dorotheos placed
    the body on a boat, intending to transfer it to the Pateron
    Monastery that is located on the Mediterranean Sea. As the boat
    branched into a smaller canal in the western branch of the
    Nile, the water became very shallow. The sailors began asking
    for the intercession of St. Severus, and the boat sailed six
    miles until it reached the sea. Severus’ body was
    interred in the monastery in a tomb built by archon Dorotheos.
    The narrative describes the occurrence of miracles after the
    death of Severus. These miracles were another sign of his
    sainthood — a message not to be missed by the
    audience.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P7"/>[7] The
    third commemoration is for the death of Severus of Antioch on
    <hi style="color:red; font-family:CopticSSK">Kduhp</hi> 14
    (Meshir 14).<ref target="#FN25">25</ref> It is a one-page summary of his life story. It
    includes his birth, the prophetic vision received by his
    grandfather, his education and baptism, his monastic life,
    followed by his ordination as patriarch, his disagreement with
    the Chalcedonian confession, his flight to Egypt, his death in
    Sakha and the translation of his relics to the Pateron
    Monastery. Severus also appears in Synaxarium entries devoted
    to other figures. <hi style="color:red; font- family:CopticSSK">Kduhp</hi> 13 (Meshir 13)
    commemorates Pope Timothy the Third, Pope 32 of
    Alexandria.<ref target="#FN26">26</ref> The entry mentions that Severus arrived in
    Egypt during Timothy’s primacy and that both of them
    traveled around the country strengthening the believers in the
    faith. This entry emphasizes the pastoral qualities of these
    two leaders and the suffering they endured for their faith. A
    distinctive feature of Pope Timothy’s Synaxarium entry is
    his connection with Severus. The <hi style="color:red; font-family:CopticSSK">T`pknsgh</hi> 7
    (Pharmouthe) entry celebrates the life of St. Maqrophios. The
    narrator informs us that Maqrophios accompanied Severus during
    his travels in Upper Egypt.<ref target="#FN27">27</ref> During this time, Maqrophios fell
    in love with the monastic life and joined a monastery. This
    entry draws attention to the impact of Severus’ life on
    those who met him. In short, the entries, not only portray a
    defender of the faith, they present a saint, a wonder worker,
    an exemplary man, and a good shepherd.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P8"/>[8] St.
    Severus of Antioch is especially honored in the Coptic Church
    liturgy. In the <hi rend="italic">Absolution of the Servants</hi> that is
    said after the offerings and in the diptych, Severus of Antioch
    is the first in the hierarchy of the patriarchs to be
    mentioned, even before Dioscoros, Athanasius and Cyril of
    Alexandria. He has precedence over all of the
    patriarchs.<ref target="#FN28">28</ref> In the morning raising of incense, in
    preparation for the liturgy, during the <hi rend="italic">Litany of the
    Fathers</hi>, the Syriac Orthodox Patriarch is described as a
    brother in the apostolic ministry. This shows the close
    relationship between the two churches. The Coptic Church not
    only welcomed Severus during his lifetime, but also honors him
    in her prayers after his death.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P9"/>[9] Two
    major Syrian monastic figures are honored in the Coptic Church,
    Simeon the Stylite on <hi style="color:red; font-family:CopticSSK">O`xwlq</hi> 9 (Pashons 9)
    and St. Barsauma, the father of the Syrian monks on
    <hi style="color:red; font-family:CopticSSK">Kduhp</hi> 9
    (Meshir 9).<ref target="#FN29">29</ref> The Synaxarium entry for Simeon the Stylite
    focuses on his sainthood and how he lived on a pillar for
    forty-five years. In comparison, the Synaxarium entry for Mar
    Barsauma, who died in AD 458, one year before Simeon,
    highlights Barsauma’s theological stance. The entry
    indicates that Mar Barsauma was severely persecuted by the
    Chalcedonians because he was a staunch anti- Nestorian and
    anti-Chalcedonian. After Barsauma’s death a pillar of
    light remained in his cell. These are two important Syrian
    monastic saints venerated by the Coptic Church. Both were
    praised for their sainthood, both witnessed the events of
    Chalcedon. Barsauma was praised for his theological stance.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P10"/>[10] The
    influence of Simeon the Stylite is evident in the life of St.
    Agathon the Stylite.<ref target="#FN30">30</ref> He was an Egyptian who at the age of
    thirty-five was ordained a priest. At the age of forty he went
    to the skete of St. Macarios. He constantly read the life of
    Simeon the Stylite and wanted to follow his example. At the age
    of fifty he went to the city of Sakha and lived on a pillar for
    fifty years. He died at the age of one hundred. The Synaxarium
    does not give any reason why he chose the city of Sakha to
    practice the ascetical life of a stylite, but it is interesting
    to observe that it is the place where St. Severus of Antioch
    was first buried.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P11"/>[11] The
    Synaxarium mentions St. Peter of Edessa, bishop of Gaza, who
    was an assistant to Emperor Theodosius II.<ref target="#FN31">31</ref> During his
    residency at the imperial court he lived an ascetic life. He
    later left the court and joined a monastery. He was ordained
    bishop of Gaza. It is said that during his first liturgy blood
    filled the paten. When Marcian became emperor and began
    persecuting the non-Chalcedonian bishops, Peter took the relics
    of St. James the Persian and fled to Egypt. After the death of
    Marcian he returned to Gaza. Peter of Edessa was a saint of
    Syrian origin who became bishop of Gaza, suffered persecution
    by the Chalcedonians, and found refuge in Egypt.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P12"/>[12]
    <hi style="color:red; font-family:CopticSSK">Kdqwpf</hi> 21
    (Mesore) commemorated the martyrdom of thirty thousand
    Christians in Alexandria. Proterius, the prefect of Alexandria,
    looted churches and monasteries, and when the Copts rioted,
    Proterius responded by massacring thirty thousand Christians.
    After the death of Marcian, Leo was appointed Emperor, and
    during his reign the bishops of Egypt ordained Pope Timothy as
    patriarch of Alexandria.<ref target="#FN32">32</ref> He was later exiled for seven
    years. When Timothy returned to Alexandria, Patriarch Peter of
    Antioch visited Egypt and a council of five hundred bishops
    from Alexandria, Constantinople, Antioch and Jerusalem was
    convened. All the bishops refused the Chalcedonian definition.
    This Synaxarium narrative is quite polemical, but it shows that
    the council was convened through the joint efforts of the
    bishops of Alexandria and Antioch. These are the four main
    Synaxarium accounts that are contemporary with the council of
    Chalcedon. Three of the four accounts, those of Mar Barsauma,
    St. Peter of Edessa, and the thirty thousand martyrs of
    Alexandria, clearly exhibited polemical repercussions on the
    life of the people and church after Chalcedon.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P13"/>[13] The
    Synaxarium mentions four exchanges of letters of faith between
    the Alexandrian and the Antiochene Churches.<ref target="#FN33">33</ref> The first of
    these took place when Severus of Antioch became patriarch in AD
    512. He sent a letter to Pope Johannes II, Pope 30 of
    Alexandria, who was patriarch from AD 505 to 516.<ref target="#FN34">34</ref>
    Severus initiated the correspondence and sent a letter to the
    Patriarch in Alexandria, who in turn responded with a letter
    affirming the same faith. When his successor, Pope Dioscorus
    II, Pope 31 of Alexandria (AD 516-8), became pope, he exchanged
    letters with Severus of Antioch (AD 512-8).<ref target="#FN35">35</ref> According to the
    Synaxarium the first two letters were exchanged during the time
    of Severus of Antioch: the first he sent, while the second he
    received. This took place somewhere between sixty or seventy
    years after the council of Chalcedon. Further research is
    needed to clarify whether Severus of Antioch initiated this
    tradition of exchange of letters of faith between the Syrian
    and Coptic Churches.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P14"/>[14] The
    third exchange of letters between the two churches took place
    during the time of Pope Peter IV, 34<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Pope of
    Alexandria (d. 569).<ref target="#FN36">36</ref> The exchange was between Peter and
    Theophanios, Patriarch of Antioch, when both were in exile. The
    fourth exchange of letters of faith is mentioned during the
    time of St. Anastasius, 36<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Pope of
    Alexandria.<ref target="#FN37">37</ref> Athanasius, Patriarch of Antioch, initiated
    the letter after the death of his predecessor Peter the
    Chalcedonian, Patriarch of Antioch.<ref target="#FN38">38</ref> Anastasius was so pleased
    with the letter that he sent an invitation to Athanasius to
    come and visit Alexandria. Athanasius was well received,
    together with all the bishops who accompanied him. The two
    Patriarchs and their bishops convened for a full month in one
    of the monasteries on the coast at the outskirts of the city of
    Alexandria. The Synaxarium makes clear that the momentous
    decisions that took place during the meetings were the
    reestablishment of the ties between the two churches that had
    been strained by the preceding Chalcedonian patriarch in
    Antioch.<ref target="#FN39">39</ref> The letter of faith was mentioned because it
    was the cause for the meeting that occurred between the two
    churches and because it was mentioned as part of Pope
    Anastasius’ work during his tenure. After AD 611 there is
    no official mention in the Synaxarium of any exchange of
    letters of faith between the two churches.<ref target="#FN40">40</ref>

    Three post-Chalcedonian Patriarchs of Alexandria were
    ethnically Syrian.<ref target="#FN41">41</ref> The first pope elected from among the
    Syrians to the See of St. Mark was Pope Simeon, 42<hi rend="sup">nd</hi>
    Pope of Alexandria (d. AD 700).<ref target="#FN42">42</ref> He was a monk in the
    Pateron Monastery (<hi style="color:red; font-family:Iqraa">{ƒ[.gh vd]</hi>, Deir
    Al-Zugag). The Synaxarium links Simeon to his Syrian heritage
    by mentioning to his readers that Severus of Antioch was buried
    in the monastery. The Synaxarium attests to his saintly life.
    There were two attempts to poison Pope Simeon and he survived
    both of them. Pope Simeon was a great reformer. He fought very
    fiercely against a new trend among Coptic men who began
    emulating the Arabs by taking more than one wife. The second
    Pope of Syrian origin was Pope Johannes X, 85<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Pope
    (d. AD 1369).<ref target="#FN43">43</ref> Nothing is known about his life except that he
    was from Damascus and his sobriquet was Al-Mu-tamen Al-Shamy
    (<hi style="color:red; font-family:Iqraa">™lƒagh
    Kljclgh</hi> the Damascene entrusted [with the Church]). The
    sobriquet indicates that he was found worthy to be entrusted
    with the Church. These two examples show the closeness between
    Copts and Syrians. It is worthwhile noting that Popes in the
    Coptic Church are chosen by the lay people, not the church
    hierarchy. These were not political decisions.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P16"/>[16] The
    most famous of the three Syriac popes is Pope Abraam,
    62<hi rend="sup">nd</hi> Pope of Alexandria (d. 970).<ref target="#FN44">44</ref> He was commonly
    known as Ibn-Zar’a Al-Suriany <hi style="color:red; font-family:Iqraa">™kƒdvsgh Muv.
    Kf†</hi>, or Abraam bar Zar’a among the Syrians.
    Abraam was a merchant. He used to travel frequently to Egypt
    and eventually he settled there. When the Patriarchal seat was
    vacant he was chosen to be the Patriarch. During his tenure,
    Abraam was also faced with the Coptic men emulating the Arab
    majority by acquiring concubines, and he made it part of his
    lifework to stop such a practice. His fame arose from the
    following story. Severus Ibn-El-Muqafaa, bishop of
    El-Ashmunien, was a contemporary of Pope Abraam. While
    Ibn-El-Muqafaa was in the court of the Emir El Muez
    (<hi style="color:red; font-family:Iqraa">.‹lgh</hi>), he
    reluctantly participated in a debate with a Jewish scholar.
    Historical narratives indicate that such debates among the
    representatives of Christianity, Judaism and Islam were common
    in the courts of the Islamic Caliphs and Emirs. Bishop Severus
    won the debate and the Jewish scholar decided to take his
    revenge. He returned to court with the biblical text and read
    to the Emir that it is written in the gospel that <hi rend="italic">For truly
    I tell you, if you have faith the size of a mustard seed, you
    will say to this mountain, ‘Move from here to
    there,’ and it will move; and nothing will be impossible
    for you</hi> (Matt 17:20). The scholar added, if Christians
    believe that the gospel is true, let them prove this verse. The
    Emir welcomed the suggestion, since the Muqatam Mountain was
    encroaching on the city of Cairo. Pope Abraam was summoned to
    court and was informed that if he did not move the Moqatam
    Mountain, Christianity and the Gospel message would be
    considered invalid. The consequences of not meeting such a
    challenge would have led to the immediate persecution and
    extermination of the Copts. Pope Abraam requested three days to
    deliver the Emir’s demands. He then gathered some monks
    and bishops to the Mu’alaqa Church (<hi style="color:red; font-family:Iqraa">Mrg‹lgh Msdk;</hi>) in
    Old Cairo, and fasted and prayed for three days. On the third
    day the Virgin Mary appeared to the Pope and asked him to
    gather the people before the mountain and a miracle would take
    place. El Muez, accompanied by government dignitaries, stood on
    one side of the mountain and the Pope, together with the Coptic
    people, on the other side. They began praying and kneeling and
    with each kneeling they would say <hi rend="italic">kyrie eleison</hi> (Lord
    have mercy). Each time they knelt, the mountain would be raised
    above ground high enough to permit the sun’s rays to be
    visible from underneath the mountain. This event terrified the
    spectators, and ended the confrontation. This event led the
    Copts to receive licenses to build a few churches. The miracle
    of the Muqatam Mountain has a prominent place in Coptic
    history. It proved the validity of the Gospel message and
    preserved the Coptic Church from extermination at the hands of
    El Muez. Lest Copts forget this miracle, God’s work with
    them, a three-day fast is annually observed – an addition
    that affected the liturgical practices. This pivotal event in
    Coptic history, that had its implication on liturgical
    practices, was championed by a Syrian Pope of the Coptic
    Church. Copts remember Abraam the Syrian for his piety and for
    his wisdom in handling the situation. This memory is beyond
    dogmatic rhetoric.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P17"/>[17] Pope
    Abraam added more than the three days of fast in commemoration
    of the Miracle of moving the Muqataam Mountain; he also added
    the fast of Jonah. The Copts observed the fast of the Week of
    Hercules, but not the Syrians.<ref target="#FN45">45</ref> When Pope Abraam was
    elected, he observed this fast on the condition that the Copts
    would participate in the Syrian fast of Jonah. The Copts agreed
    because they admired his piety.<ref target="#FN46">46</ref> It was agreed that the
    Copts would observe this three-day fast fifteen days prior to
    the Great Lent following the strict dietary rules of the Great
    Lent.<ref target="#FN47">47</ref> These additional ascetic observances that the
    Copts follow are credited to Pope Abraam’s piety. It is a
    piety beyond dogmatic rhetoric.<ref target="#FN48">48</ref>

         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P18"/>[18]
    Another aspect of Coptic-Syriac relations evolved after the
    Arab invasion. Both Copts and Syrians were forced to translate
    their Christian literatures into a new language. Both churches
    were faced with problem of finding Arabic terms that could
    convey Christian theological ideas. The first resource of the
    two churches had been to transliterate Greek words into Arabic
    form. However, since Syriac is a Semitic language, the Syrians
    found it very convenient to include some Syriac words as well
    in their translation, adding a Christian dimension to the
    meaning of the words. The Copts eventually borrowed from the
    Syrians, enriching the Coptic-Arabic vocabulary with
    “loan” Syriac words. These words became so much a
    part of the language, that the average Copt is usually unaware
    that these are Syriac loan words. As to the average Arab
    reader, they sometimes think that these are Coptic loan words,
    since they do not understand them, and since they are not found
    in any Arabic dictionary. The Copts could have made use of only
    Greek theological terms. They chose to include Syriac loan
    words as well. This is an indication of the close relationship
    between the Copts and Syrians.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P19"/>[19] Here
    are a few examples.<ref target="#FN49">49</ref> Copts employ some monastic terms that are
    loan words from Syriac. Copts use the Arabic <hi style="font-family:Iqraa;layout-grid-mode:line">vd]</hi>
    (<hi rend="italic">deir</hi>) for “monastery” which comes from
    the Syriac <hi rend="italic">dayrâ</hi>
            <hi lang="SYR" dir="rtl" style="color:blue; font-family:'Estrangelo Edessa'" xml:lang="SYR">@‚[K</hi>. The Copts use this Syriac word, while
    neither the Greek nor the Coptic words for monastery have
    survived in current use. Another monastic term commonly used is
    <hi style="color:red; font-family:Iqraa">Mjdfv</hi>
    (<hi rend="italic">rubîtah</hi>) which comes from the Syriac
    <hi lang="SYR" dir="rtl" style="color:blue; font-family:'Estrangelo Edessa'" xml:lang="SYR">@ˆ\DB</hi> (<hi rend="italic">rabbayta’</hi>) that is the
    title given to the monastery manager.<ref target="#FN50">50</ref> The Arabic

    (<hi rend="italic">oikonomos</hi>) and sometimes <hi style="color:red; font-family:Bwgrkl">h`gou,menoj</hi>
    (<hi rend="italic">egoumenos</hi>) have survived in some of the Arabic
    literature, but <hi style="color:red; font-family:Iqraa">Mjdfv</hi> 
            <hi lang="SYR" dir="rtl" style="color:blue; font-family:'Estrangelo Edessa'" xml:lang="SYR">@ˆ\DB‚</hi>
    (<hi rend="italic">rubîtah</hi>), the Syriac loan word, is the word
    mostly used.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P20"/>[20]
    Copts employ some Syriac liturgical terms as well. The verb to
    baptize <hi style="font -family:Iqraa">]lu</hi>
    (<hi rend="italic">‘mad</hi>) and <hi style="color:red; font-family:Iqraa">]luH</hi>
    (<hi rend="italic">u‘mid</hi>) are from the Syriac word <hi lang="SYR" dir="rtl" style="color:blue; font-family:'Estrangelo Edessa'" xml:lang="SYR">Jht@</hi> (<hi rend="italic">
               <hi rend="sup">c</hi>mad</hi>). Both <hi style="color:red; font-family:Iqraa">]ƒlu</hi>
    (<hi rend="italic">‘mad</hi>) <hi lang="SYR" dir="rtl" style="color:blue; font-family:'Estrangelo Edessa'" xml:lang="SYR">@Khs</hi>, the act of baptism, and <hi style="color:red; font-family:Iqraa">Md],l‹l</hi>
    (<hi rend="italic">ma’mudia</hi>) <hi lang="SYR" dir="rtl" style="color:blue; font-family:'Estrangelo Edessa'" xml:lang="SYR">@ˆ[KOhsg</hi> are from the Syriac root. The latter
    can also be used to describe the baptismal font. The Godfather
    present during baptism is <hi style="color:red; font-family:Iqraa">Kdfa</hi>
    (<hi rend="italic">šbin</hi>) and <hi style="color:red; font-family:Iqraa">KdfaH</hi> (<hi rend="italic">a
    šbin</hi>) from the Syriac <hi lang="SYR" dir="rtl" style="color:blue; font-family:'Estrangelo Edessa'" xml:lang="SYR">AQ\D…O…</hi>
    (<hi rend="italic">shawshbina</hi>).<ref target="#FN51">51</ref> These liturgical terms were
    borrowed from the Syriac rather than Greek or Coptic.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P21"/>[21]
    Common and formal ecclesiastical terms borrowed from Syriac
    include <hi style="color:red; font- family:Iqraa">Kiƒ;</hi>
    (<hi rend="italic">kahin</hi>) derived from the Hebrew and also used by the
    Syrians <hi lang="SYR" dir="rtl" style="color:blue; font-family:'Estrangelo Edessa'" xml:lang="SYR">AlM</hi> priest <hi lang="SYR" dir="rtl" style="color:blue; font-family:'Estrangelo Edessa'" xml:lang="SYR">@‡OkM_</hi> priesthood. The Copts also use the
    Arabic term <hi style="color:red; font-family:Iqraa">Sr
    Sdsr</hi> (<hi rend="italic">qis, qasis</hi>) from the Syriac word
    <hi lang="SYR" dir="rtl" style="color:blue; font-family:'Estrangelo Edessa'" xml:lang="SYR">Aƒ\ƒ}</hi> (<hi rend="italic">qashysha</hi>). It is the
    term of choice when using informal language. The Arabic term
    <hi style="color:red; font-family:Iqraa">Sƒla</hi>
    (<hi rend="italic">šamâs</hi>, deacon), is derived from the
    Syriac word <hi lang="SYR" dir="rtl" style="color:blue; font-family:'Estrangelo Edessa'" xml:lang="SYR">A…h„</hi> (<hi rend="italic">shamesh</hi>). In Christian
    Arabic it is used to refer to all non-priests who serve at the
    altar regardless of their exact rank, whether cantor, reader,
    or sometimes even deacon, though for the rank of deacon, the
    word <hi style="font-family:Iqraa">K,;ƒd]</hi>
    (<hi rend="italic">dîakûn</hi> derived from <hi style="color:red;font-family:Bwgrkl">dia,konoj</hi>) is usually
    augmented to the word <hi style="color:red; font-family:Iqraa">Sƒla</hi>
    (<hi rend="italic">šamâs</hi>) to designate the specific rank of
    deacon.<ref target="#FN52">52</ref>
         </p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P22"/>[22]
    Three other words frequently used by Copts are the Arabic
    <hi style="color:red; font- family:Iqraa">vƒl</hi>
    (<hi rend="italic">mâr</hi> “saint”, the Arabic
    <hi style="color:red; font-family:Iqraa">vldl</hi>(<hi rend="italic">mîmar</hi>)
    “homily” and the Arabic <hi style="color:red; font-family:Iqraa">™f,'</hi>
    (<hi rend="italic">tûba</hi>) “blessed.” The term for
    “Saint” <hi style="color:red; font-family:Iqraa">vƒl</hi>
    (<hi rend="italic">mâr</hi>) is derived from the Syriac <hi lang="SYR" dir="rtl" style="color:blue; font-family:'Estrangelo Edessa'" xml:lang="SYR">Z‚g</hi> (<hi rend="italic">mar[i]</hi>) and is attached to
    most saints’ names as well as the Arabic word
    <hi style="color:red; font-family:Iqraa">Sd]r</hi>
    (<hi rend="italic">qîdîs</hi>) derived from the Arabic root
    <hi style="color:red; font-family:Iqraa">S]r</hi>
    (<hi rend="italic">qds</hi>).<ref target="#FN53">53</ref> Both terms are used in official language
    indiscriminately. For example it is customary to say either
    <hi style="color:red; font- family:Iqraa">Srvl
    vƒl</hi> or <hi style="color:red; font-family:Iqraa">Srvl Sd]rgh</hi>
    (<hi rend="italic">mâr murqus</hi> or <hi rend="italic">alqîdîs
    murqus</hi>). The Arabic term for “homily”
    <hi style="color:red; font-family:Iqraa&#34;&gt;vldl&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;em&gt;mîmar&lt;/em&gt;) is derived from the Syriac &lt;span lang=&#34;SYR&#34; dir=&#34;RTL&#34; style=&#34;color:blue; font-family:" estrangelo="">@‚gAg</hi> is commonly used, though it is
    primarily applied to early Christian homilies written by the
    early Fathers of the Church. The third common word is the
    blessedness used in the beatitudes—the Arabic
    <hi style="color:red; font- family:Iqraa">™f,'</hi>
    (<hi rend="italic">tûba</hi>) derived from the Syriac <hi lang="SYR" dir="rtl" style="color:blue; font-family:'Estrangelo Edessa'" xml:lang="SYR">AlBOV</hi> (<hi rend="italic">te’b</hi>). The word has
    a similar root in Hebrew, and it is the only word used to
    express blessedness in the biblical sense in the Arabic
    language. In every case a Syriac word was chosen instead of a
    Coptic or Greek term. This is a simple demonstration of the
    impact of Coptic-Syriac relations beyond dogmatic rhetoric.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P23"/>[23] Both
    Orthodox Churches stem from two of the oldest civilizations of
    the world. The two Churches share a common history in many
    respects. Both Churches constantly experienced the presence of
    vibrant Jewish communities. Both Churches shared a Greco-Roman
    heritage that influenced many aspects of religious and social
    life. Historically they were influenced by the Romans, Greeks,
    Persians, Arabs, Turks, British, and French. Each culture left
    its stamp on the religious practice of both Churches. The
    geographical proximity of these two Churches led to an
    extraordinary exchange of ideas and religious figures. All of
    these points need further scholarly investigation, because
    these factors shaped the present Coptic and Syriac Churches,
    and shaped the relationship between them. Other topics of
    investigation might include liturgy, monastic exchange, and
    religious and cultural influence.<ref target="#FN54">54</ref> I would also be interested
    in an examination of the relationship between the two Churches
    from the Syriac perspective, from Syriac liturgical sources,
    and the possible impact of the Coptic Church on the Syrian. The
    present good relationship between the two Churches is not only
    based on theological agreement, though of course this is a
    crucial factor. Even though the Coptic Church shares
    theological agreements with other Churches, e.g. the Armenian
    and the Ethiopian, the relationship between the Coptic and
    Syriac Churches has a special dynamic. I hope that this will be
    a starting point for further research.</p>_______<lb/>

    19. Other Synaxarium editions have different compilers,
    occasionally leading to some date discrepancies and different
    lists of saints or events for a day’s entry. For example,
    the Alexandrian Synaxarium edited by Forget mentions that the
    editors are “Bishop Michael, bishop of Atrib and Melig
    and others.” I. Forget, ed. <hi rend="italic">Synaxarium
    Alexandrinum</hi>. CSCO, vol 47, Ar. III, 18, t. 18, (Beryti, E
    Typographeo Catholico, 1905-26), 1. There are two different
    sets of editors for each of the above mentioned editions. This
    has resulted into two different compilations of the Synaxarium.
    Also R. Basset, <hi rend="italic">Le synaxaire arabe jacobite (recension
    copte)</hi>, in <hi rend="italic">Patrologia Orientalis</hi> 1, 3, 11, 16,
    17, and 20 (1904-1929). Also R. Coquin, “Le synaxaire des
    coptes; un nouveau témoin de la recension de
    Haute-Égypte,” <hi rend="italic">Analecta Bollandiana</hi> 96
    (1978), 351-365. The edition of choice for this study is the
    1978 El- Mahaba edition. The reason for this choice is that
    this study is concerned with church relations past and present;
    therefore, the study and reference will be limited to the
    modern edition (references to the Forget edition is made for
    comparative purposes only), since the El-Mahaba edition
    contains the collective memory of present day Coptic Church
    goers.</p>

    the first compilation began by the sixth century; further
    additions and maybe major revisions took place in the twelfth
    and thirteenth century. The latest addition was in the 1970s
    when the life of the late Pope, Pope Cyril VI, was included

            <ref target="#FNRef9">9</ref> The topic of the relationship between the Coptic
    and Syriac Churches could be approached through history, the
    lives of the Patriarchs, or other sources. But for the sake of
    this study that focuses on the popular understanding of the
    ecclesial relationship between both churches, the Synaxarium is
    an appropriate starting point. For example, in the Synaxarium
    we find that the relationship with the Armenian Church is
    rather minimal. However, if we look at Severus
    Ibn-El-Muqafaa’s history we find a different relationship
    with the Armenian Church. In the life of Pope Cyril II, we read
    about the visit of Gregory, the Armenian Patriarch. We also
    know of a saintly Armenian monk in the Monastery of St.
    Macarius who could perform exorcism. We also know that the
    majority of the Amîr- al-Guyûš’s army
    were Armenians. Sawirus Ibn Al-Mukaffa, <hi rend="italic">History of the

            <ref target="#FNRef39">39</ref> Butler writes his own version of the events
    taking a more historical perspective. “…[I]n the
    early autumn of 615 AD, the Coptic Patriarch Anastasius
    received a visit from Athanasius, the Patriarch of Antioch, who
    had been dispossessed by the Persian invasion. They met, as has
    been stated, in the celebrated Ennaton monastery on the
    sea-coast westward of Alexandria. One or two bishops from Syria
    probably accompanied their Patriarch; others, like Thomas of
    Harkel and Paul of Tella, were already settled at the
    monastery, working hard at their great task of revising the
    Syriac version of the Bible collation of the Greek: and yet
    others were in Egypt as refugees. For “while the Persians
    were ravaging Syria, all who could escape from their hands
    – laymen of all ranks, and clergy of all ranks with their
    bishops – fled for refuge to Alexandria.’
    (Gelzer’s <hi rend="italic">Leontius von Neapolis,</hi> Anhang ii.
    P112). It is therefore extremely probable that, as tradition
    avers, five Syrian bishops were present at the meeting of the
    two Patriarchs, which resulted in the establishment of union
    between the Syrian and the Coptic Church. Athanasius only
    remained a month in Egypt, after which he returned to
    Syria...” Alfred J. Butler, <hi rend="italic">The Arab Conquest of

            <ref target="#FNRef45">45</ref> According to a <hi rend="italic">Katameros</hi> footnote
    the Week of Heraclius is based on what is mentioned in the
    history book written by Patriarch Eutychius the Melkite. The
    <hi rend="italic">Katameros</hi> explains the story of the Week of Hercules
    as follows: When the Persians besieged Constantinople for six
    years during the reign of Heraclius, he was able to escape the
    city. The Persians killed the generals, raped their women, and
    looted the city. They did the same with Jerusalem. According to
    the chronicle, the Jewish people aided the Persians in
    destroying the churches, especially the Church of the
    Resurrection and looted and burnt the city. When Heraclius
    reached the city of Jerusalem on his way back to
    Constantinople, the surviving Christians pleaded that he would
    kill all the Jews. He refused saying that he gave them a treaty
    of peace and he could not forsake his promise. The inhabitants
    responded that the Jews had not kept their promise of
    protecting the city and its inhabitants so it was permissible
    for him to forsake his own promise with them. They added that
    they were ready to fast for one full week on his behalf.
    Heraclius agreed to these pleading conditions and gave
    permission for the inhabitants to kill the Jews. Based on this
    promise the Patriarch of Jerusalem sent letters to all the
    Patriarchs to fulfill this promise. This was during the time of
    Pope Andronikos, 37<hi rend="sup">th</hi> pope of Alexandria. And since
    the time of Andronikos, the Church of Alexandria fasts one week
    prior to the Great Lent in fulfillment of this promise. See
    <hi rend="italic">The Katameros of the Great Lent, Serves the Sundays and
    Weekdays of the Great Lent according to the Order of the Coptic
    Orthodox Church</hi> (The Commission of Publication in the
    Diocese of Beni-Suef, 1986), footnote 2, p26. [The word
    “Katameros” is equivalent to the word
    “Lectionary” and is derived from the Greek
    <hi style="color:red; font-family:Bwgrkl">kata. me,roj</hi>
    (<hi rend="italic">Kata meros</hi>).] What the <hi rend="italic">Katameros</hi> failed to
    mention, as written in the chronicles of Eutychius, is that all
    the other churches stopped this fast after the death of
    Heraclius except the Coptic Church. See L. Cheikho, B. Carra De
    Vaux, and H. Zayyat, <hi rend="italic">Eutychii Patriarchae Alexandrini
    Annales</hi>, CSCO, vol 51, Ser. 3, T. 7, (Beryti E Typographeo
    Catholico, 1909), 7. Strangely enough though this incident has
    affected the church fasting calendar, Severus Ibn-El-Muqafaa,
    bishop of El-Ashmounien does not mention this important event
    in his <hi rend="italic">History of the Patriarchs</hi>. Though Severus
    mentions the savagery of the Persian invasions he could have

    life of Pope Andronikos who these events occurred during his
    tenure]. R. Graffin – F. Nau, <hi rend="italic">History of the

    Synaxarium also does not mention any establishment of a new
    fast in the Church in the life of Pope Andronikos,
    37<hi rend="sup">th</hi> pope of Alexandria, <hi style="color:red; font-family:CopticSSK">Rwah</hi> (Tobe) 8. This
    is considered an important change in the liturgical calendar
    and should have been mentioned in the life of a Patriarch. John
    of Nikiou also does not make any reference to such an incident,
    even though he wrote in great graphic details how Phocas, the
    Persian General, raped Fabia, wife of Heraclius the younger,
    during the invasion of the Persians to Constantinople. Charles,
    <hi rend="italic">The Chronicle of John of Nikiu</hi>, 167. Butler also does
    not make any mention of such an event during his description of
    the attack of the Persians on Alexandria and his reference to
    Andronikos. Butler, 69-92. <hi rend="italic">The History of the
    Patriarchs</hi> written by Eusebius, bishop of Fuah, in the
    thirteenth century does not mention any of these events either.
    See Eusebius, bishop of Fuah, <hi rend="italic">The History of the
    Patriarchs</hi>, Fr. Samuel the Syrian and Nabih Kamel, ed. (n.
    d.), 48-9. It relevant to note that Eusebius is very dependent
    on the History of the Patriarchs written by Severus, bishop of
    El-Ashmounien. Though most of the early historians have
    attested to the collaboration of the Jews with the Persian army
    in many provinces, the story of the Jewish slaughter in
    Jerusalem is not mentioned anywhere. In addition, the Coptic
    Church now does not account for the extra week fasted before
    the Great Lent as the Week of Heraclius but as days
    compensating the Sabbaths where abstinence from food is
    prohibited. In conclusion, the explanation of the Week of
    Heraclius raises more questions than answers. It was only
    mentioned in the Melkite historian and Patriarch
    Eutychius’ history and not mentioned in any of the Coptic
    sources. In addition, the rest of the churches do not follow
    this custom any more. The authenticity of such an event needs
    further study. In connection with our topic, it is most
    probable that the Copts simply fasted the three days of Jonah
    in accordance with Pope Abraam’s wishes since he was
    accustomed to keep this fast in Syria, and the Copts willingly
    complied, simply because he proved such piety, especially in
    the movement of the mountain. <ref target="#FNRef45">

            <ref target="#FNRef48">48</ref> Six centuries later, in AD 1587, Pope
    Gabriel VIII, Pope 97 of Alexandria, was ordained to the See of
    St. Mark. He ordered that the Copts were not to fast the Fast
    of Jonah, but after his death, this decree was reverted, and
    the fast is still practiced to this day. It is important to
    note that Pope Gabriel wanted to introduce other changes in the
    fasts of the Coptic Church. He wanted to limit the Fast of the
    Apostles to fourteen days (from <hi style="color:red; font-family:CopticSSK">O`wlh</hi> [Paone] 21
    – <hi style="color:red; font- family:CopticSSK">Dofo</hi> [Epep] 5). The
    way this fast is calculated is that it begins the second day of
    Pentecost and ends on <hi style="color:red; font-family:CopticSSK">Dofo</hi> (Epep) 5, the
    Feast of the Apostles Peter and Paul. Therefore, the beginning
    of the fast is variable, since Pentecost does not have a fixed
    day in the Liturgical calendar. His attempts to change the date
    were with the intention to limit the fast to two weeks ending
    on the Feast of St. Paul and St. Peter. He also wanted to
    decrease the Advent Fast by fifteen days. He also wanted to
    make the Fast of the Virgin Mary voluntary. None of these
    changes endured. After his death, the old custom was followed.

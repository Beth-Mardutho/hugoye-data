            <anchor xml:id="P1"/>[1] The
    (North American) Syriac Studies Symposium gathers scholars,
    researchers, graduate students, and interested public from all
    over the world for a three day conference on Syriac studies.
    Symposium V will take place in Canada for the first time,
    following four successive symposia in the United States:
    Providence RI (1991), Washington DC (1995), Notre Dame IN
    (1999), and Princeton NJ (2003).</p>
         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P2"/>[2]
    Preference will be given to papers or sessions that directly
    deal with the main theme: The role of Syriac in bridging
    antiquity with the medieval Near East, ancient Greece with the
    Islamic civilizations, Christianity with the Far East, etc., in
    literature, translations, art, architecture and any other
    relevant field. Other proposals in the areas of Syriac
    literature, Biblical versions, history, art, archaeology, and
    theology are also welcome.</p>
         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P3"/>[3] As in
    the past conferences, the Syriac Studies Symposium will jointly
    convene with the International Forum on Syriac Computing. This
    forum aims to give those working on computational projects in
    Syriac the opportunity to share information. Papers on all
    aspects of Syriac computing are welcomed, including: databases
    (lexical, bibliographical, catalogues), word processing, fonts,
    desktop publishing, critical editions, computer aided
    learning/teaching, software and systems.</p>
         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P4"/>[4] Please
    submit a title and a 250 word abstract if you wish to present a
    (20 minute) paper. The submission deadline is 28 February 2007.
    If you wish to propose a session, indicate its theme and
    participants, and enclose copies of abstracts for the papers.

    Applications are invited for an NEH-sponsored seminar, titled
    "The Middle East Between Rome and Persia: Early Christianity on
    the Path to Islam." The six-week seminar will be held at the
    University of Notre Dame, from June 19 until July 26, 2007.</p>
         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P2"/>[2] The
    Seminar will draw on the literature and material culture of the
    region to explore the ways in which the resurgent indigenous
    cultures there � Arabic, Syriac, Aramaic-speaking Jewish, and
    Armenian � re-emerged with the decline of local Hellenism to
    form a population that would in the seventh century be
    receptive to a new political and religious hegemony. For four
    centuries, this region was prized by western or Iranian empires
    and dominated by the imperial culture, language and religion of
    each. Despite these rival hegemonies, by the beginning of the
    seventh century the Middle East in late antiquity was
    re-emerging as a distinct zone, a fungible area allowing for
    the passage, conquest and settlement of the dar al Islam.
    Christian and Jewish cultures in the old marchlands between the
    Iranian and Roman imperia were being incorporated in a central
    Islamic territory. There they would coexist in a
    multi-religious society that only at the present moment is
    finally shattering.</p>
         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P3"/>[3] We
    intend to explore how the native Christianities and the Jewish
    communities of the region made such a conquest and enduring
    settlement possible.</p>
         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P4"/>[4] This
    seminar will be directed by Professors Joseph Amar, Professor
    of Classics (whose background is in Syriac and Arabic history),
    and Robin Darling Young, Associate Professor of Early
    Christianity (who specializes in the Greek, Syriac and Armenian
    churches).</p>

         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P1"/>[1] This is
    a series of essays intended to make stimulating reading for
    non-specialists, while not being intended exclusively for
    them. A review for a journal of Syriac studies should
    consider the book from the specialist’s point of
    view. The French Académie des Inscriptions et
    Belles-Lettres is to publish a series of volumes, arranged by
    country or region, constituting a systematic edition of Syriac
    inscriptions around the world: <hi rend="italic">Recueil des Inscriptions
    Syriaques</hi>, to be referred to as <hi rend="italic">RIS</hi>. The
    volume under review appears to be a survey of the inscriptions
    to be edited in this collection.  The several chapters
    originated in papers presented by various scholars to a
    conference held in Paris on 7 November 2003. The
    contributors (in alphabetical order) are: A. Badwi, F. Briquel
    Chatonnet, A. Desreumaux, M. Gorea, A. Harrak, F.
    Helliot-Bellier, A. Kassis, W. Klein, P. Marsone, R. Niu, L.
    van Rompay, J. Thekeparampil and J.-B. Yon. The map on p.
    169 shows Asia, Cyprus and Egypt as the areas to be covered,
    but on p. 51 reference is also made to two inscriptions in
    Rome. No reference is made to the growing number of
    inscriptions in the churches of the Syrian Christian diaspora
    (see one example in paragraph 11 of this review). This
    volume is also the first in a series of <hi rend="italic">Études
    syriaques</hi> to be published by the newly-founded
    Société d’études syriaques, of which
    the object is “the culture of Syriac-speaking Oriental
    Christianities, whatever their confession”, including
    “sacred scripture, theology, patristics, philosophy,
    grammar, history, law, liturgy, astronomy, medicine, poetry and
    graphic arts”, a list which, while it is probably
    intended to include “everything which makes up the
    cultural wealth of these communities”, happens to omit
    architecture and archaeology (p. 11). Non-Christian
    Syriac, though, is perhaps intentionally excluded.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P2"/>[2] The
    survey begins with Edessa, the home of the Syriac
    dialect. Briquel Chatonnet and Desreumaux do mention
    <hi rend="italic">The Old Syriac Inscriptions of Edessa and Osrhoene</hi> by
    Drijvers and Healey (1999) and the earlier work of Segal on the
    pre-Christian Aramaic inscriptions, though they refer neither
    to the extensive pagan inscriptions of Soghmatar, nor to the
    Christian inscriptions collected from Qasr al-Banat by Max van
    Oppenheim in 1899 and imperfectly published by B. Moritz in
    <hi rend="italic">Beiträge zu Assyriologie und semitischen
    Sprachwissenschaft</hi> 7.2 (1913), 157-74. They outline
    the history of Syriac epigraphy (pp. 15-17); distinguish two
    types of inscriptions, those on sacred monuments and those
    commemorating the death of clergy and “even of
    women”—though it ought to added that these were
    nuns (p. 18f.); and mention the regions of Commagene and
    Armenia, on one side of Osrhoene, and Tur ‘Abdin on the
    other (p. 19f.), before going on to discuss Syria (p. 21f.),
    where Christian Syriac mosaic inscriptions have been found in
    many of the ancient churches. (This reflects the
    favourable conditions which have obtained in that country for
    Christian archaeology.) There are even a couple of civic
    inscriptions in Syriac, which means that language was used
    beyond the religious sphere. These inscriptions tell more
    about the past than just names and dates (p. 23f.): a lintel at
    Zabad engraved in Syriac, Greek and Arabic is “the
    earliest dated inscription in the Arabic language and
    script”.  On M. Gorea’s drawing one can make
    out “in the year 823” (A.D. 511/2?).  The
    Alpha, though Greek, hangs on the right arm of the cross, Omega
    on the left, a probably unconscious Semiticism. The
    authors conclude “that Edessa seems to disappear rather
    early from the corpus, whereas in Northern Syria the use of
    Syriac in inscriptions increases from the fifth century
    onwards”.  This argument from the silence of
    Christian Syriac epigraphy in Edessa ignores the manuscripts,
    some of them produced before 600, which attest the continued
    use of Syriac there. Many witnesses lie buried: who, then,
    will be “astonished” (p. 24) that they do not
    speak? The authors themselves regret that no systematic
    archaeological research has been done in Edessa.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P3"/>[3] The next
    chapter, on the inscriptions of Lebanon, has a historical
    introduction by Kassis with a map (pp. 29-31); a section on the
    stone inscriptions by Yon (pp. 32-36); and a section on the
    painted inscriptions (pp. 36-40), in particular the
    twelfth-century paintings in the church of Mar-Tedros at
    Ba<hi rend="u">h</hi>didat, which are presented by Badwi
    with reference to the unpublished MA-dissertation of his
    student Chadi Abi Abdallah (<hi rend="italic">corrigenda:</hi> nos. 1-5 do
    not correspond to nos. 1-5 in the figure and in no. 7 the
    Syriac word for darkness is spelled with ‘Ayn instead of
    <hi rend="u">H</hi>eth). Omitted from the survey,
    perhaps because of its uncertain provenance—it turned up
    on the antiquities market in Lebanon, but it refers to the era
    of Antioch—, is a long and informative inscription
    commemorating the construction of a bema, presumably of stone,
    “in the year 653, in the computation of Antioch, in the
    year eight” (note the phonetic transcription of the Greek
    number as <hi rend="italic">oghdo</hi>), that is between 1 October 604, when
    the 653<hi rend="sup">rd</hi> year after Julius Caesar’s grant of
    autonomy to Antioch began, and 31 August 605, when Byzantine
    Indiction VIII ended (B. Aggoula, “Studia Aramaica
    III”, <hi rend="italic">Syria</hi> 69, 1992, 391-422, includes, on pp.
    401-6, a new edition with a translation in which E. Renhart,
    <hi rend="italic">Das syrische Bema</hi>, Graz, 1995, p. 53, places too much
    faith). The era of Antioch is unlikely to have been used
    so far south as Lebanon (the date 859 on the lintel-inscription
    from <hi rend="u">H</hi>arb ‘Ara, in the extreme
    North of Lebanon, is plausibly interpreted as Seleucid on p. 32
    of the book under review, though, as can be seen from Plate
    II.1, the era is not specified). The most interesting
    stone inscriptions of Lebanon are those of the quarries of
    Kamid al-Lawz, which show that men from Edessa and even further
    afield (some were East Syrians) were quarrying here in 715
    under the Caliph Walid.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P4"/>[4] After
    travelling from Northern Mesopotamia through Syria to Lebanon,
    the survey arrives in the Holy Land. “Inscriptions
    of travellers and émigrés” are found in
    Acre, Galilee, Jericho, Bethlehem, Jerusalem, the Negev, Sinai,
    Jordan, Cyprus and Rome. Desreumaux, the author of this
    chapter, here announces his forthcoming publication of the
    Syriac graffiti on the columns of the mediaeval porch of the
    Holy Sepulchre. Those that are dated bear witness to the
    continuation of the pilgrimage of Syrian Christians from
    Northern Mesopotamia to Jerusalem during and after the
    Crusading period. Having published papers on this
    pilgrimage and on the relations of Syrian Christians with the
    Crusader states, this reviewer was disappointed that these
    inscriptions were not placed in their historical
    context. See A. Palmer, ‘The History of the Syrian
    Orthodox in Jerusalem’, <hi rend="italic">Oriens Christianus</hi>, 75
    (1991), 16-43, and <hi rend="italic">id.</hi>, ‘The History of the
    Syrian Orthodox in Jerusalem, Part Two: Queen Melisende and the
    Jacobite estates’, <hi rend="italic">Oriens Christianus</hi>, 76
    (1992), 74-94. We also learn of the recent discovery, in 2002,
    of two eighth-century (?) inscriptions in the black desert of
    <hi rend="u">H</hi>arrah, the first Syriac inscriptions to
    be found in Jordan (they are to be published by M. Gorea) and
    of the epigraphic evidence of an East-Syrian community on
    Cyprus in the fourteenth century (p. 50).</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P5"/>[5] There
    follows a chapter on the Syriac inscriptions of the Monastery
    of the Syrians in Egypt which amply satisfies the
    reader’s hunger for historical context. The
    inscriptions illuminate the relationship between Dayr
    al-Suryān and the city of Tagrīt, in Iraq, beginning
    with the mirror-image memorial to the (Tagrītan) Patriarch
    Cyriac (793-817), unique in Syriac and much earlier than
    comparable inscriptions in Arabic, and the record of what may
    have been the origin of the monastery in 819 (a suggestion:
    might not the second letter in line 5, though it looks like a
    Beth, be read as a Mim?). Van Rompay, the author,
    questions the general validity of the statement that the
    Syrians in Egypt regarded themselves as belonging to the Church
    of Syria in the light of three prominent inscriptions of the
    ninth and tenth centuries at that monastery which put the
    Patriarch of the Coptic Church first, see H. Kaufhold,
    “Kirchliche Gemeinschaft und Schisma im Spiegel syrischer
    Schreibervermerke”, <hi rend="italic">Oriens Christianus</hi> 85
    (2001), 94-118.  He points out that linguistic politics at
    the monastery, where Coptic and Syrian monks dwelled side by
    side, leaned towards Coptic in the ninth century and towards
    Syriac in the thirteenth, from which time onwards
    Kaufhold’s conclusion, which was based on colophons, may
    indeed apply (p. 62). His closing reference to the
    “radical uniqueness (<hi rend="italic">unicité
    radicale</hi>)” of the details on which inscriptions
    oblige us to concentrate reminds this reviewer of that first
    searching encounter with letters on stone, by which a hand long
    dead grips the imagination and makes a new initiate in
    history.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P6"/>[6]
    Harrak’s chapter on Iraq (pp. 75-106) is the longest in
    the book, and the most systematic. He classifies the
    abundant material into (A) liturgical, (B) funerary, (C)
    commemorative and (D) historical inscriptions and divides each
    of these groups into as many as nine sub-categories. The
    category of liturgical inscriptions, also introduced (under
    another name) by Briquel Chatonnet <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi>, is a
    necessary one, certainly for modern inscriptions. Harrak
    concludes his liturgical section with the following words:
    “The great number of liturgical inscriptions and the
    beauty of their calligraphy underline the fact that these
    inscriptions hold in the Syriac Church the place occupied by
    icons and statues in the Byzantine and Latin Churches; hence
    their sacred character” (p. 87). This goes too far.
    The devotees of an Eastern Orthodox icon or a Roman Catholic
    statue light candles in front of the object of their devotion
    and kiss it if they can. And even in a church where the
    walls are covered with holy pictures, such as St.
    Ephrem’s, Heilbronn, there may be a number of beautifully
    calligraphed liturgical inscriptions.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P7"/>[7] Among
    the funerary inscriptions from Tagrīt Harrak documents the
    use of phrases such as “May the Lord have pity on
    So-and-so on the Day of Judgement!” (p. 88) and refers to
    a similar inscription about two Tagrītans in the Monastery
    of the Syrians in Egypt. The shared diction surely supports
    Harrak’s claim that the latter inscription is also
    funerary. This time it is surely Van Rompay who overstates
    his case (p. 69): “Nothing indicates that these two
    persons were dead at the time the inscription was
    produced.” Harrak also examines the epigraphic
    diction of building-records
    . This
    reviewer was pleased to read that <hi rend="italic">
               <hi rend="u">h</hi>addeth</hi> should not always be taken in its
    literal sense of ‘renovate’, since it is sometimes
    a euphemism for ‘rebuild’ (rebuilding churches was
    forbidden under Islamic law). Compare already A. Palmer,
    ‘Corpus of inscriptions from <hi rend="u">T</hi>ūr <hi rend="sup">c</hi>Abdīn and environs’,
    <hi rend="italic">Oriens Christianus</hi> 71 (1987), 53-139, at p. 95.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P8"/>[8] The
    following chapter on ‘Syriac and Manichean magic bowls of
    Mesopotamian origin’, by Gorea, is marred by a number of
    misprints and mistranslations: <hi rend="italic">mryhwn
    d’swt’</hi> is read as “Lord of
    healings” (p. 112), instead of “Lord of
    doctors” (<hi rend="italic">osawoto</hi> is the plural of
    <hi rend="italic">osyo</hi>) and <hi rend="italic">p<hi rend="u">s</hi>n</hi>
    corresponds to nothing in the English translation quoted in
    note 16 on p. 113. Nevertheless, this is a valuable
    contribution. The next chapter, Hellot-Bellier, addresses
    itself to ‘the contribution of Syriac inscriptions to our
    knowledge of the history of the Christians of Urmia’, but
    this contribution comes to so little that it is hardly worth
    writing about (p. 122). One wonders what Wassilios Klein
    could have done with the Syriac tombstones of Iran; his
    interpretation of those published by Chwolson from finds in
    Central Asia (650 of them in Kirghizstan) is a bold one,
    carefully related to historical questions raised by other
    sources. He concludes that the Black Death which ravaged
    Europe in 1347-51 did not originate in China, as commonly
    thought, for it arrived in China “a few years after
    1338/9”, in which year (witness: the tombstones) it
    decimated the sedentary population of Northern Kirghizstan and
    made them unable to resist the wave of nomads. As a direct
    result, Christianity disappeared from this region until the
    Russians brought it back in the nineteenth century. Texts
    vertically inscribed as if they were banners hanging from the
    arms of the Cross (p. 132) appear elsewhere in a context of
    near-despair, where a Christian community threatened with
    extinction invoked this talisman of survival through
    suffering. See A. Palmer, ‘The Messiah and the
    Mahdi: History Presented as the Writing on the Wall’ in:
    <hi rend="italic">Polyphonia Byzantina: Studies in Honour of Willem J.
    Aerts</hi>, ed. Hero Hokwerda and Edmé Smits and Marinus
    Westhuis. Mediaevalia Groningana, 13 (Groningen, 1993),
    45-84.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P9"/>[9] Eight
    lines of Uyghur writing are inscribed vertically below the arms
    of a cross at Chifeng in Inner Mongolia, framed by a quotation
    from the Aramaic (Pshī<hi rend="u">t</hi>to) version
    of Psalm 34:5: <hi rend="italic">
               <hi rend="u">h</hi>ūr lwoteh w
    sabar beh</hi> (“Look on Him and place your hope in
    Him”) and the same words (also quoted in the Ehnesh East
    Wall inscription) are found framing a cross above a lotus
    flower in Beijing (p. 149). The rest of the paragraph on
    Beijing in the chapter on the inscriptions of China by Niu,
    Desreumaux and Marsone (p. 149) is too allusive to be
    comprehensible. The references to the illustrations on
    Plate VII in this chapter are unclear, not being given in the
    same way as in other chapters. On p. 150 (just after
    Sarah, Rebecca and Rachel have been referred to, without
    comment, as “angels”) we read that Wu Wenliang,
    beginning in 1928, collected a large number of inscribed
    gravestones, but the bibliography includes no publication by
    Wenliang. The authors are unaware of the project on the
    Christian tombstones of Quangzhou which Sam Lieu, Ken Parry and
    others have been working for some years now at Macquarie
    University (See the <ref target="http://www.abc.net.au/rn/relig/ark/stories/s794442.htm">interview</ref> they gave to Rachael Kohn on 5th
    March 2003). This project, which enjoys wide academic
    support, is funded by UNESCO as part of its Integrated Study of
    the Silk Road programme. One of their findings is that God
    is referred to in a number of Christian inscriptions of
    Quangzhou as Buddha!</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P10"/>[10]
    Buddhism came to China from India, so the name of Buddha offers
    us a transition to Kerala, the south-western coastal state to
    which the last chapter of the book, by Briquel Chatonnet,
    Desreumaux and Thekeparampil, is devoted. After a brief survey
    of Indian Church history the authors survey the inscriptions,
    which are classified as records of building-work;
    “inscriptions commémoratives” (records of
    other historical events); altar-inscriptions and prayers; and
    funerary monuments. This agrees, in the main, with
    Harrak’s classification, though he coins the more compact
    term “liturgical inscriptions” and (a possible
    source of confusion) uses “inscriptions
    commémoratives” of building-records,
    distinguishing these from “inscriptions
    historiques”. They go on to speak of the particular
    interest of this corpus of sixty-two inscriptions, collected by
    the authors in 1996, 2000 and 2002. There are no inscriptions
    securely dated before the arrival of the Portuguese, though
    there are some from before the Synod of Diamper (1599), which
    already show Latin influence. Excessive pressure to conform to
    Roman Catholic tradition led to an appeal to the Syrian
    Orthodox patriarch in the seventeenth century (Oath of the
    Coonan Cross, 1653), as a result of which contacts began to
    take place between Kerala and Tur ‘Abdin, which gave
    rise, in 1874, to a poetic inscription about the mission of two
    envoys of the Patriarch of Antioch, one of whom died in 1685
    and was buried in Kothamangalam. This is an example of the
    Syriac renaissance of the nineteenth century, which is attested
    by a number of inscriptions.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P11"/>[11] The
    authors also refer to inscriptions of the mid-twentieth century
    in Trichur and even to one in Ayamkudi dated to the year 2000.
    This makes it difficult to defend the omission from the book of
    any reference to the late twentieth and early twenty-first
    century Syriac inscriptions of Europe, the Americas and
    Australia. Perhaps these should, after all, form a volume of
    <hi rend="italic">RIS</hi>?  In the Syrian Orthodox church of St.
    Ephraem in Heilbronn, Baden-Württemberg, for example,
    there is a commemorative inscription on the front of the altar
    (church bought from American Centre in 1995, sanctuary built
    with donations from the Swirinoyo family of Bê Sallo
    Makko and others and consecrated by Mor Dionysius Isa
    Gürbüz in 2002), a eucharistic inscription (John
    6:53) around the arch of the altar-niche, a more general
    liturgical text (Psalm 26:6) around the archway of the Royal
    Gate, a baptismal text (John 3:5) around the arch of the niche
    on the south side in which the font is placed and a
    commemorative inscription around the <hi rend="italic">gûrno</hi>
    itself, accompanied by the same baptismal text. The
    chapter under review ends with a note on the scripts of Kerala
    (compare A. Palmer, ‘The Syriac letter-forms of
    <hi rend="u">T</hi>ūr ‘Abdīn and
    environs’, <hi rend="italic">Oriens Christianus</hi> 73, 1989, 68-89)
    and these are illustrated by two drawings: one of the splendid
    funerary inscription of Alexander de Campo at Kuravilangad
    (A.D. 1687) in English, Syriac and Malayalam on p. 162 and one
    of an inscription recording the construction of a doorway at
    the west end of the Syrian Orthodox Church of Saint Thomas at
    Mulanthuruthy in 1575.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P12"/>[12] A
    photograph of the latter inscription taken by Riccardo
    Grassetti is printed in S. P. Brock and D. G. K. Taylor,
    <hi rend="italic">The Hidden Pearl</hi>, 3 (S. P. Brock and W. Witakowski):
    <hi rend="italic">At the turn of the third millennium: the Syrian Orthodox
    witness</hi> (Rome, 2001), p. 116. This reviewer has seen
    it and traced with his finger the original contours of the
    writing, which were not accurately followed by the later
    painter, who knew little Syriac. It is the painted
    inscription which is drawn (inaccurately in line 5) on p. 158
    of the book under review. For <hi rend="italic">RIS</hi> a squeeze
    should be made and photographed in a raking light which shows
    only the contours in the stone. This is one of the
    inscriptions allegedly showing Latin influence in the years
    leading up to the Synod of Diamper (p. 164). That will be
    disputed here. Here are three translations with the phrase to
    be discussed here underlined:</p>
         <quote>

      de notre Seigneur Jésus-Christ, au mois de teshrin
      premier, le 9<hi rend="sup">e</hi> jour, un dimanche, <hi rend="u">on a posé</hi> la porte du sanctuaire de

      cinquante-et-un ++. (Briquel Chatonnet <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi>,
      2004, p. 156f.)
    </quote>
         <quote>
      In the year 1575 of our Lord Jesus Christ, on the 9th of the
      month of October, a Sunday, this doorway <hi rend="u">was
      set up</hi> for the nave of the church of St Thomas; by the
      Kulam era, the year 751. (Brock <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi>, 2001,
      p. 116)
    </quote>
         <quote>

      and five [according to] (the era of) the birth / of our lord

      thereof / on day : 9 : (for: “on day 9 thereof”?)

      (subject of the verb “raised up”). / + Kullam
      seven / hundred and fifty / and one. + + (Palmer, here)
    </quote>
         <p>As Briquel Chatonnet <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> have seen,
    Brock’s passive “was set up” (representing
    <hi rend="italic">Olap-Taw-Taw-Qup-Yud-Mim</hi>) does not correspond to the
    traces on the stone, where the reading
    <hi rend="italic">Olap-Qup-Yud-Mim</hi> is clear (it is confirmed by the
    sense of touch). The translation must therefore be
    “he raised up”, but who is the
    subject? According to normal Syriac practice in all
    centuries the subject is usually postponed until after the main
    statement. A study of epigraphic diction in and around Tur
    ‘Abdin confirms this with specific reference to building
    records: see A. Palmer in <hi rend="italic">Oriens Christianus</hi> 72 (1988)
    114-23. Shying away from the conclusion that Saint Thomas
    is the subject, Briquel Chatonnet <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> translate
    “on a posé”.  The same study of
    epigraphic diction shows that this would have been expressed
    with a passive verb.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P13"/>[13]
    “Saint Thomas raised up a doorway/door for the prayer
    hall of the church.”  Supposing this is the correct
    translation—and there is nothing to be said against it in
    philology—how would contemporaries have understood this
    strange statement? The Syriac <hi rend="italic">tar‘o</hi> can
    designate either a doorway or the door by which it is
    closed. If it were the former, then we should have to
    suppose that the church was built without a doorway on the west
    side and that this was added in 1575, which seems
    unlikely. The first readers would of course have been
    aware that a human carpenter fabricated the door, but they may
    have been willing to believe that Saint Thomas operated through
    that human body. St Thomas is represented in the apocryphal
    <hi rend="italic">Acts of the Apostle Judas Thomas</hi> as the twin of Jesus,
    who brought the Christian religion to India.  He is the
    Apostle of India and might well have been opposed, as such, to
    St Peter, the Apostle on whom the Roman Catholic Church rested
    its authority.  Such an opposition, in the second half of
    the sixteenth century, could have been regarded as dangerous by
    that Church. Perhaps that explains the enigmatic nature of this
    inscription: a forbidden patriotism is here encrypted. The
    key to the code may lie in the Bible. In Chapter 10 of the
    Gospel according to John Christ calls himself a doorway and
    brands as “a thief” anyone who comes into the
    sheepfold another way. Perhaps, then, our inscription is a
    guarded way of saying, seventy-eight years before the Oath on
    the Coonan Cross, that 'St Peter' (i.e. the Pope) is stealing
    the sheep which belong to St Thomas? In any case, we
    cannot translate <hi rend="italic">‘idto</hi>, followed, without a
    <hi rend="italic">d-</hi>, by the words <hi rend="italic">qadisho tuma</hi>, as
    “l’église Saint-Thomas” without
    imposing a foreign idiom on the Syriac language, which is
    perhaps why Briquel Chatonnet <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> speak of a Latin
    influence on the diction of this inscription. Another solution,
    much simpler, only occurred to me when it was too late to check
    it by running my finger over the words once more: perhaps what
    was originally written was <hi rend="italic">qashisho</hi>, not
    <hi rend="italic">qadisho</hi>, and the door was erected by an ordinary human
    priest called Thomas who may have doubled up, like St Thomas,
    as a carpenter? For a carpenter-priest in Bsorino, a village of
    Tur ‘Abdin, see A. Palmer, <hi rend="italic">Monk and Mason on the
    Tigris Frontier: The Early History of <hi rend="u">T</hi>ur ‘Abdin</hi>, University of Cambridge
    Oriental Publications, 39 (Cambridge: Cambridge University
    Press, 1990), microfiche 2, H: “The Book of Life:
    Translations of the Narrative Sections”, p. 11.</p>

    <hi rend="italic">Les inscriptions syriaques</hi> is a collection of
    scholarly papers which form an eloquent, accessible
    introduction to a subject otherwise difficult of access. It
    makes no claim to exhaustiveness and indeed it is easy, as a
    specialist, to find important omissions in it. It reveals the
    scope of the planned <hi rend="italic">Recueil des Inscriptions
    Syriaques</hi> and amply justifies that project. Desreumaux
    announced this new initiative more than ten years ago; see A.
    Desreumaux and A. Palmer, “Un projet international: Le
    recueil des inscriptions syriaques”, <hi rend="italic">VI Symposium
    Syriacum 1992</hi>, ed. R. Lavenant (Orientalia Christiana
    Analecta 247; Rome, 1994) 443-47. One can see from the
    volume under review that he has been the most active of all
    those involved.  He is to be congratulated warmly on what
    he has achieved so far. If this review has been critical of
    certain aspects of this survey, it is only because it is
    important that the <hi rend="italic">RIS</hi> itself should be in all
    essentials immune to criticism and so a worthy monument to the
    evident commitment of the contributors.</p>

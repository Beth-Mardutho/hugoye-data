                several suggestions on these points as well. I also show that the Greek

                    a close relationship to the Greek pseudo-Hippocratic treatise of the same name
                    first edited by Jouanna in 2006; one is certainly a translation of the
                        other.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn1" n="1"><p xml:lang="en"> Although I
                            use “translation” in a somewhat broader sense than the one it has for
                            modern times, allowing for a somewhat higher level of invention and
                            adaptation on the translator’s part, I have found no egregious instances
                            of innovation on the part of any translator here, as far as the
                            translation’s putative Urtext is concerned. The text of the Syriac work,
                            as well as a Latin translation, appears in J.-B. Chabot, “Notice sur

                            treatise, meanwhile, has been edited and translated into French (as <hi

                    relevant manuscripts; my aim here is simply to establish the relationship
                    between these texts. Along the way I will make some suggestions about the
                    underlying causes of their affinities, as well as some adjustments that may need
                    to be made to the Greek text on the basis of the Syriac.</p>

                    on a Greek model, citing the Greek origin of the name Anṭīpaṭrōs, and the

                    Chabot suggests that the work’s Greek Vorlage had simply been attributed to a
                    certain Antipatros; the name Aḥūdemmeh was the addition of an overzealous
                    copyist, who was familiar with ʿAbdīšōʿ's attribution of a work with a similar
                    title, the <hi rend="italic">Treatise on the Composition of the Person</hi>, or
                        <hi rend="italic">Persons</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Mēmrā ʿal rūkkāb
                        qnōmā</hi>/<hi rend="italic">qnōmē)</hi> to Aḥūdemmeh, and, assuming that
                    this must be the same as what he had in front of him, “corrected” the
                    attribution accordingly.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn6" n="6"><p xml:lang="en">

                            a note appended to an article by Gignoux touching on the origins of the

                            Aḥūdemmeh Anṭīpaṭrōs, Jouanna discusses an unsuccessful search for
                            parallels to the Syriac text in the attested writings and overall
                            intellectual orientations of either of these Antipatroses. (P. Gignoux,

                    attributed to Aḥūdemmeh, first edited by Nau, with the all-but-identical title

                    the treatise attributed to Aḥūdemmeh Anṭīpaṭrōs; Chabot does not spell this
                    possibility out, but a copyist aware of the former work’s existence but
                    unfamiliar with its contents could have made an analogous overcorrection.<note

                    erroneous, in pointing to the work’s curious double attribution: the text’s very

                <p xml:lang="en"> Gignoux, meanwhile, has advanced a dissenting view, saying that
                    this work is “difficult to attribute to a Roman physician,” but is rather an
                    original Syriac composition, likely to be attributed to the same Aḥūdemmeh who
                    wrote the West Syrian <hi rend="italic">On the Composition of Man</hi>.<note

                    Aḥūdemmeh is to be identified with the East Syrian bishop “Aḥūdemmeh of Nisibis”
                    who is named as a participant in a 544 church council.<note place="foot"
                        xml:id="ftn11" n="11"><p xml:lang="en"> Ibid., 231.</p></note> Gignoux makes
                    two points to support his contention that this treatise is an original Syriac
                    work, neither of which is particularly convincing. First, he floats the
                    possibility that both Aḥūdemmeh and Anṭīpaṭrōs are not simply proper names in
                    the attribution of the East Syrian <hi rend="italic">On the Composition of
                        Man</hi>, but are rather to be interpreted in their Syriac and Greek root
                    meanings--“brother of his mother” and “in the place of the father,”
                    respectively. For Gignoux, these terms could be working in concert to specify
                    the role the author of this work played in his family--an uncle who served as a
                    kind of “guardian” for his sister’s children.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn12"
                        n="12"><p xml:lang="en"> Ibid., 233.</p></note> This explanation, while
                    ingenious, does nothing to get around the difficulty the unmistakably Greek name
                    Anṭīpaṭrōs poses for the identification of this text as an original Syriac
                    composition; indeed, if “Anṭīpaṭrōs” was actually meant to mean “in the place of
                    the father” here, rather than simply functioning as a name (given how
                    well-attested this name is in the Roman Empire, the latter possibility is much
                    more likely), this would actually be a strong indication that the bearer of this
                    name lived among Greek speakers.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn13" n="13"><p

                    understood except within the Syriac tradition,” and that there is “no need to

                    demonstrates, has clear parallels with the treatise attributed to Aḥūdemmeh
                    Anṭīpatrōs, and likely drew on this work, whether directly or indirectly.<note

                    57, and immediately followed by the words “thus said the great Hippocrates,”
                    corresponds closely to the Greek pseudo-Hippocratic treatise <hi rend="italic"
                        >On the Composition of Man</hi> edited and translated by Jouanna in

                    below, multiple scenarios could explain this correspondence: the basis for the
                    Greek could be an excerpt from the Syriac treatise attributed to Aḥūdemmeh
                    Anṭīpatrōs, or one of the Syriac treatise’s component parts that circulated
                    separately; or the basis for part of the Syriac treatise attributed to Aḥūdemmeh
                    Anṭīpatrōs could be this Greek pseudo-Hippocratic treatise—the part of the
                    Syriac not corresponding to this pseudo-Hippocratic treatise would then consist
                    of other translations from Greek (or other languages), or original Syriac
                    compositions. </p>
                <p xml:lang="en"> Jouanna’s edition is based on four manuscripts: the 15th-century
                    Ambrosianus gr. 331 (which I will hereafter designate as A., following Jouanna’s
                    shorthand); the 16th-century Parisinus gr. 985 (P.); the 16th-century Parisinus
                    gr. 2320 (Par.); and the 15th- or 16th-century Parisinus gr. 2494 (Pa.).<note

                    the treatise in its “most complete” form, Jouanna makes it the basis for his
                    edition, but he leaves open the possibility that the version in P. is “in some
                    respects” a more “developed” form of an originally “shorter version” and that
                    Par. may preserve such a shorter version, rather than being a lacunary version
                    of the text in P.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn18" n="18"><p

                </p>
                <p xml:lang="en"> In fact, as we will see, the section of the treatise attributed to
                    Aḥūdemmeh Anṭīpatrōs corresponding to this Greek pseudo-Hippocratic work mostly
                    agrees with Par., as well as Pa., over P., indicating that Jouanna’s suspicions
                    about the chronological priority of Par. relative to P. were likely correct, and
                    that the former manuscript should be prioritized accordingly for any Greek text.
                    If the Syriac was the basis for the Greek, it is self-evident that the Greek
                    manuscripts corresponding more closely to the Syriac should be prioritized. If,
                    on the other hand, the Greek was the basis for the Syriac, it is probable that
                    this translation was made sometime between the sixth and ninth centuries—the
                    period in which medical translations are known to have been made from Greek into
                    Syriac. Given that even the ninth century precedes our earliest Greek manuscript
                    by some 500 years, in this scenario, too, the Syriac text should be assigned
                    great importance in any edition of the Greek text.<note place="foot"

                    treatise in Par., along with Pa., is said to be on the “composition” (<foreign

                    four Greek manuscripts, before turning to a more in-depth comparison of the
                    Syriac and Greek manuscripts’ respective renditions of selected passages and
                    phrases. The text begins with a general description of “man,” outlining “his”
                    relationship to God, and to the rest of creation (according to Jouanna’s
                    numbering of the sections, which I will adopt here, this is section I).<note

                    text on P., but Pa. and Par. are considerably closer to the Syriac than P. (or
                    A.). Jouanna’s text generally corresponds to the Syriac quite closely, and
                    discrepancies between Jouanna’s text and the Syriac can often be resolved by
                    selecting a reading from Pa. or Par. over one from P. or A. Jouanna’s text
                    diverges most from the Syriac in the sections concerning the influence of one’s
                    time of conception (VI-IX); while Jouanna’s text and the Syriac continue to
                    share general structural features here, the two texts’ specific contents diverge
                    to a considerably greater extent than they do in the surrounding sections. Two
                    features of the Greek manuscript heritage may help to explain this: Pa., perhaps
                    the closest of the Greek manuscripts to the Syriac, breaks off just after the
                    beginning of section V; while Par.’s rendering of sections VI-IX is considerably
                    more laconic than that of P. (the basis of Jouanna’s text, of course), and is in
                    some respects closer to the Syriac.</p>

                <p xml:lang="en"> Aside from the awkward double attribution at the very beginning,
                    the treatise attributed to Aḥūdemmeh Anṭīpatrōs is seamless and coherent,
                    proceeding from one topic to another with little redundancy or inconsistency:
                    from a general history of medicine, to a more detailed discussion of the
                    constituents of the human body, known thanks to the progress medical science has
                        made.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn32" n="32"><p xml:lang="en"> On the

                    reason to suppose, purely on the basis of a reading of the Syriac, that we are
                    dealing with some kind of compilation here; only a demonstration that the Greek
                    is the basis for the section of the Syriac text to which it corresponds would
                    lead us to that conclusion. </p>

                    though on this front my results remain preliminary and speculative. I will start
                    from the very beginning of the text; as the following table shows, the profound

                <p xml:lang="en">Even within these first few lines, then, we have several clear
                    parallels between the two texts, on the most noteworthy among which I will now
                    briefly comment. To begin, we have two particularly striking bits of
                    nearly-equivalent phrasing. In the Syriac and Greek texts “man” is called a “god
                    of terrestrial things” and a “terrestrial god,” respectively, in a nearly
                    parallel construction, which finds the copula after the noun, but before the
                    adjective (<hi rend="italic">elāha-w d-arʿānē</hi>; <foreign xml:lang="gr">θεός
                        ἐστιν ἐπίγειος</foreign> ). Further, the Syriac text refers to “man” as “the
                    image of his creator” (<hi rend="italic">dmūtā d-bāryeh</hi>) while the Greek
                    has the almost identical “the image of the one who created him” (<foreign
                        xml:lang="gr">εἰκὼν…τοῦ πλάσαντος αὐτόν</foreign>).</p>
                <p xml:lang="en"> There are also some curious partial parallels here, which may
                    point to the direction of the translation. First, there is the Syriac phrase
                    “bond of the two creations” (<hi rend="italic">esārā d-tartēn brītē</hi>)
                    corresponding to “girt with two parts” in Greek (<foreign xml:lang="gr"
                        >ἐζωσμένος... τοῖς δυσὶ μέρεσιν</foreign> ). In this particular case, it is
                    easier to imagine the Greek being a translation from the Syriac than vice-versa.
                    This Syriac phrase “bond of the two creations” has a close parallel in an
                    anonymous Syriac homily initially attributed to Ephrem, which Jansma believes to
                    be of Greek origin.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn36" n="36"><p xml:lang="en"> J.

                            monde” (L’Orient Syrien 5 [1960]), 389, 398-400.</p></note> In this
                    text, the human being is designated as the single “bond” (<hi rend="italic"
                        >esārā</hi>) which God made in order to “gather and fasten together the
                    creation” (<hi rend="italic">neqoš w-neḥzoq l-brītā</hi>); humans are uniquely
                    “related to” both the “invisible” and “visible” parts of creation, insofar as
                    they possess both soul and body.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn37" n="37"><p

                            création du monde,” 389 (translation).</p></note> The phrase “bond of
                    the two creations” in the Syriac <hi rend="italic">On the Composition of
                        Man</hi> is surely an elliptical reference to the same notion, the unique
                    link between the “invisible” and “visible” that humanity constitutes. As for the
                    Greek “girt with two parts,” meanwhile, I have been unable to find such a clear
                    parallel elsewhere in this language’s corpus, though here it could mean
                    something analogous but not equivalent to the Syriac phrase: the “two parts”
                    could be the body and soul, which the human being has “put on” like a piece of
                    clothing. Furthermore, the Syriac word used for “bond” here (<hi rend="italic"
                        >esārā</hi>) can also mean “girdle,” whereas the Greek word corresponding to
                    “girt” (<foreign xml:lang="syr">ἐζωσμένος</foreign>) cannot be construed in the
                    wider sense of “bound.” It is most likely that the discrepancy between the
                    Syriac and Greek on this point stems from a translator’s incorrect choice among
                    the meanings of the Syriac word <hi rend="italic">esārā</hi>, rather than his
                    invention of an entirely new meaning for the Greek <foreign xml:lang="gr"
                        >ἐζωσμένος</foreign>. </p>
                <p xml:lang="en"> The apparent correspondence between Syriac “thing” or “will” (<hi
                        rend="italic">ṣbūtā</hi>) and Greek “will” (<foreign xml:lang="gr"
                        >θέλημα</foreign>) may be an analogous case. Although the possibility that
                        <hi rend="italic">ṣbūtā</hi> in Syriac means “will” rather than “something”
                    here should not be entirely discounted, here too we may have an instance of a
                    Greek translator choosing incorrectly among the various meanings of a Syriac
                    word, translating <hi rend="italic">ṣbūtā</hi> as “will” rather than
                    “something.” </p>
                <p xml:lang="en"> Finally, as noted in Chabot’s edition, the Syriac text refers to
                    the human being with a phrase from the Peshitta version of <hi rend="italic"
                        >Ecclesiasticus </hi>43:2, “marvelous instrument” (<hi rend="italic">mānā

                        rend="italic">mānā d-tedmūrtā</hi>, is used as a descriptor for humanity
                    near the beginning of Aḥūdemmeh’s <hi rend="italic">On the Composition of

                            Nau, Histoires d’Ahoudemmeh et de Marouta, 101.4.</p></note> This phrase
                    seems to correspond to “marvelous dwelling-place” (<foreign xml:lang="gr"
                        >ἐνδιαίτημά… θαυμαστόν</foreign> ) in the Greek text. Jouanna deems this to
                    refer to paradise, adducing a parallel passage in ps.-Gregory Nyssa’s <hi
                        rend="italic">On Paradise</hi>, in which the same phrase meaning “marvelous
                    dwelling-place,” <foreign xml:lang="gr">ἐνδιαίτημα… θαυμαστόν</foreign> , refers
                    to paradise, and, as in the Greek pseudo-Hippocratic treatise, occurs just after
                    an assertion of humanity’s superiority to animals. There is a real possibility
                    of a translation going either way here, as both “marvelous instrument” and
                    “marvelous dwelling-place” make sense in context, and have clear parallels
                    elsewhere in Syriac and Greek, respectively. It is also conceivable that neither
                    of these phrases is a translation of the other, despite their similarity to one
                    another, and corresponding place in each text. Still, it is worth noting that as
                    in the two cases we have just examined, the Syriac word <hi rend="italic"
                        >mānā</hi> has a broader range of meanings than the Greek word that seems to
                    correspond to it, <foreign xml:lang="gr">ἐνδιαίτημα</foreign>; in addition to
                    “instrument,” <hi rend="italic">mānā</hi> can also mean “vessel.” A Greek
                    translator may have had difficulty understanding how human beings could be
                    “vessels” in themselves, and accordingly construed <hi rend="italic">mānā</hi>
                    as the “vessel” containing humanity: their “dwelling-place” (<foreign
                        xml:lang="gr">ἐνδιαίτημα</foreign>). In this case it is not too hard to see
                    the misunderstanding going the other way, however; it is conceivable that a
                    translator working from Greek to Syriac could have construed <hi rend="italic"
                        >mānā</hi> in the passage from Ecclesiasticus as something more like
                    “vessel.” Seeing a corresponding equivalence between <hi rend="italic">mānā</hi>
                    and <foreign xml:lang="gr">ἐνδιαίτημα</foreign>, he could have rendered
                    “marvelous dwelling-place” (<foreign xml:lang="gr">ἐνδιαίτημα…
                        θαυμαστόν</foreign> ) as “marvelous vessel” (<hi rend="italic">mānā
                        d-tedmūrtā</hi>).</p>
                <p xml:lang="en"> A broader stylistic comparison between the Greek and Syriac texts
                    may also be relevant for the direction of the translation. The Greek <hi
                        rend="italic">On the Composition of Man</hi> makes a somewhat abrupt
                    transition, from initially describing “man” directly, as “girt with two parts”
                    and “the image of the one who created him,” to describing his attributes--“he is
                    the image of the one who created him” is immediately followed by, literally,
                    “the dwelling-place is marvelous” and “the will is desirable.” The corresponding
                    passage in the Syriac text lacks this abrupt transition, as the descriptors
                    there are consistently predicated of “man” himself, not his attributes. Of
                    course, this discrepancy between the two texts could be the result of a
                    translator working from Greek to Syriac smoothing out an awkward transition he
                    found in his Vorlage. Still, it is somewhat easier to see the valiant attempt of
                    a translator working from Syriac to Greek to make sense of an incompletely
                    understood Syriac Vorlage here.</p>
                <p xml:lang="en"> The Syriac text may also help to better establish the hierarchy
                    among the Greek manuscripts. As the above table shows, the Syriac text follows
                    the Greek manuscript Pa. significantly more closely than P., the basis for
                    Jouanna’s text. For example, the Syriac has no equivalent for the conjunction
                        <foreign xml:lang="gr">ἐπεὶ</foreign> (“for”) following <foreign
                        xml:lang="gr">θεός ἐστιν ἐπίγειος</foreign> (“he is a terrestrial god”) in
                    Jouanna’s text, which Pa. and Par. also lack; and the Syriac has no equivalent
                    for the phrases <foreign xml:lang="gr">κατέστη ὑπὸ τοῦ δημιουργοῦ</foreign>
                    (“made by the craftsman”) or <foreign xml:lang="gr">καὶ πάσης τῆς ὁρατῆς
                        κτίσεως</foreign> (“and of every visible creature”), each of which is unique

                            several additional phrases that depart from the Syriac distinctly more
                            than anything in Pa. Here and throughout the text, A.’s departures from

                <p xml:lang="en">Many parallels are immediately apparent here. The Syriac and the
                    Greek agree in assigning the body “twelve members,” some kind of further
                    subdivision into 366 parts, and 248 bones. In all likelihood, they also both
                    declare “man” to have five senses: Chabot’s text has <hi rend="italic"
                        >d-reglaw</hi> (&lt;drglwhy&gt;), “of his feet,” but this is one letter away
                    from <hi rend="italic">d-regšaw</hi> (&lt;drgšwhy&gt;), “of his senses.”<note

                            use of the Syriac conjunction/pronoun <hi rend="italic">d-</hi> here is
                            worthy of attention; for Chabot it indicates a lacuna in the Syriac text
                            (Ibid., 64, n. 7).</p></note> A discussion of the bones in the body
                    follows this passage, starting with the bones in the foot, and it is not hard to
                    imagine an inattentive copyist jumping the gun here, writing “feet” for
                    “senses.” Finally, as in the case of the passage examined before this one, the
                    Greek manuscripts Pa. and Par. are in a certain respect closer to the Syriac
                    than Jouanna’s text, which prioritizes P. The most obvious difference between
                    the Syriac and Jouanna’s Greek text here is Jouanna’s text’s enumeration of the
                    four “elements” of the body, the humors, which is entirely lacking in the
                    Syriac. As it happens, Par. entirely omits this section, while Pa. has “four
                    elements,” but also lacks the specific detailing of the four humors.<note

                            beginning of the passage through the enumeration of the four humors is

                            everything from “blood” through the “five” in “five senses” is omitted
                            in Pa. (<foreign xml:lang="gr">αἷμα…πέντε</foreign>) (Jouanna, “Un
                            traité inédit,” 298 [critical apparatus]). It is also noteworthy that
                            although the Greek sentence “[His] state is venerable with respect to
                            the whole body” (<foreign xml:lang="gr">στάσις ἐστὶ σεπτὴ ὅλον
                                σῶμα</foreign>) has nothing directly corresponding to it in the
                            Syriac text, two phrases from this sentence in the Greek do find
                            isolated parallels a bit later in the Syriac passage quoted above:
                            “whole body” (<hi rend="italic">kolleh gūšmā</hi>), and “state” (<hi
                                rend="italic">quyyāmā</hi>). It is difficult to know quite what to
                            make of this.</p></note></p>

                <p xml:lang="en">Here the broad trends we saw in the passages previously examined
                    continue: the Syriac agrees closely with the Greek in general, and particularly
                    closely with the manuscripts Pa. and Par. As can be seen in the table above,
                    there are several instances in the discussion of the bones in which the Syriac
                    agrees partially or completely with Pa. and Par. over P.; and there are no
                    instances in which the Syriac agrees with P. over either Pa. or Par. These
                    instances of the Syriac agreeing with Pa. and Par. against P. include: the
                    Syriac, Pa. and Par. assigning five bones to the “loins” (in the Syriac) and
                    “kidneys” (in the Greek), where P. assigns nine bones to this region; Pa., Par.
                    and the Syriac addressing the bones of the head after those associated with the
                    kidneys and loins, where P. discusses the bones in the legs; Pa., Par. and the
                    Syriac assigning eight bones to the neck, as opposed to P.’s five; and Pa., Par.
                    and the Syriac assigning a hundred or more bones to the right and left sides of
                    the body, while P. locates only five in each side in the corresponding passage
                    (though P. does register a figure more in line with Pa., Par. and the Syriac
                    later in the text).</p>

                    in the Greek and Syriac, whose Greek component has already been puzzled over by
                    Jouanna. Several times in the text, we have the corresponding phrases,
                    perplexing in the Greek and Syriac alike, “transformation [or, once, “form”] of

                    the strangeness of the phrase, the Greek manuscripts have significant
                    discrepancies in their renderings of it; <foreign xml:lang="gr">κρόταφος
                    </foreign>(“temple”) often occurs as a variant for the scantily attested
                        <foreign xml:lang="gr">ἐγκρόταφος</foreign> (“the back of the head”?), as
                    does <foreign xml:lang="gr">μορφή</foreign> (“form”) for the more complex

                    the phrase consistently occurs as <foreign xml:lang="gr">μεταμόρφωσις</foreign>

                    it seems likely that a difficult phrase like this would have been simplified and
                    clarified in the course of its transmission, and that P. preserves an older

                    Chabot’s suspicion that &lt;ṣwrtʾ&gt; means something other than simply “neck”
                    here finds support not only in the obscurity of the phrase “neck of the brain,”
                    but also in the fact that the most common Syriac word for “neck,” <hi
                        rend="italic">ṣawrā</hi> (spelled &lt;ṣwrʾ&gt;), is attested earlier in the

                    Chabot’s reading of &lt;ṣwrtʾ&gt; <hi rend="italic">d-mūḥā</hi>, while
                    persuasive to a certain extent, is on somewhat shaky ground in its own right; I
                    have been unable to find anything in the lexica for &lt;ṣwrtʾ&gt; as “nape,”
                    “neck” or, indeed, a word referring directly to any part of the body. The most

                    “form” (with the vocalization <hi rend="italic">ṣūrtā</hi>) and those of the
                    Greek words <foreign xml:lang="gr">μεταμόρφωσις</foreign> and <foreign

                    is surely significant, as is the correspondence between the meanings of Syriac

                        >ἐγκρόταφος</foreign>, which clearly has to do with the head; but what was
                    translated into what? We have signs pointing both ways. On the one hand, the
                    fact that &lt;ṣwrtʾ&gt; is so similar to the Syriac word for “neck” (<hi
                        rend="italic">ṣawrā</hi>), and that a word with this spelling, <hi
                        rend="italic">ṣāwartā</hi>, has two further meanings having to do with
                    health problems (“ringing of the ears”; “insanity” or “confusion”), could sway
                    us to take &lt;ṣwrtʾ&gt; <hi rend="italic">d-mūḥā</hi> as a scantily attested
                    phrase with an anatomical significance in Syriac. The sense of this phrase could
                    have eluded a Greek translator, who simply did the best he could with the only
                    meaning of &lt;ṣwrtʾ&gt; known to him: “form.” Speaking for a Greek to Syriac
                    direction, on the other hand, is the obscurity of the word <foreign

                    Syriac to Greek use such an arcane word to render <hi rend="italic">mūḥā</hi>,
                    “brain,” with the more straightforward <foreign xml:lang="gr">ἐγκέφαλος also

                    incorporates all relevant manuscripts, as well as, perhaps, a revision of
                    Jouanna’s text prioritizing the Greek manuscripts that tend to be closer to the

                    Consequently, the following suggestions remain equivocal and provisional. </p>
                <p xml:lang="en"> I will begin with the direction of the translation. The limited
                    collection of textual comparisons I have presented here does not decisively
                    point either way (nor have I been able to find anything conclusive in the rest
                    of the text), and this question is worth a comprehensive treatment once the
                    Syriac <hi rend="italic">On the Composition of Man</hi> is available in a better
                    edition. At this point, several indications suggest that the original language
                    of the text was most likely Greek: the likely original attribution of the entire
                    Syriac <hi rend="italic">On the Composition of Man </hi>to “Anṭīpaṭrōs,” as
                    convincingly argued by Chabot and Reinink; the many Greek philosophers and
                    physicians cited within the Syriac text; and, perhaps most importantly, the fact
                    that many more translations are known to have been made from Greek into Syriac
                    than from Syriac into Greek. If it is the case that the direction of the
                    translation is Greek to Syriac, this would fix the likely date of composition
                    for both the Greek and the Syriac between the sixth and ninth centuries, within
                    the period of known medical translation activity from Greek into Syriac.<note

                    Greek text would have likely been initially translated into Syriac on its own,
                    and then subsequently incorporated into <hi rend="italic">On the Composition of

                    to Greek—the less likely possibility, though some of the results of my
                    preliminary comparative analysis of the Greek and Syriac texts suggest that this
                    may have been the case—the range of plausible dates for each text’s composition
                    widens considerably. Translations from Syriac to Greek are firmly attested from
                    the third century through the eleventh century, and while the overall number of
                    such translations is quite low, and nothing medical is included among them, the
                    possibility cannot be excluded that this work went from Syriac to Greek at some

                    place from the tenth century through the fourteenth, and ultimately resulting in
                    “Arabic medicine” being “massively present in late thirteenth- and early

                    linguistic origins of these texts have yet to be thoroughly investigated, but it
                    is possible that this corpus includes some translations of Syriac medical texts
                    into Greek, which would have been made sometime between the tenth and fourteenth
                    centuries, according to Touwaide’s reckoning; the hypothetical Syriac-to-Greek
                    translation now under discussion could have been part of this trend. The
                    scenario here would be either of the following, each somewhat involved, but not
                    impossible: a pseudo-Hippocratic work was initially composed in Syriac,
                    incorporated into the <hi rend="italic">Treatise on the Composition of Man
                    </hi>attributed to Aḥūdemmeh Anṭīpaṭrōs, and independently translated into
                    Greek; or the Greek <hi rend="italic">On the Composition of Man</hi> was based
                    on an excerpt from the longer Syriac work attributed to Aḥūdemmeh Anṭīpaṭrōs. In
                    the latter scenario, we can hypothesize that the Greek translator misconstrued
                    the concluding sentence of the portion of the Syriac text that corresponds to
                    the Greek pseudo-Hippocratic treatise, “thus said the great Hippocrates,” as
                    referring to the entire section of the text leading up to it, rather than simply
                    the preceding sentence (as it almost certainly does).<note place="foot"

                    noting that I could find nothing conspicuously late in the Syriac text: the text
                    contains no loanwords from Arabic, nor was I able to discern any other

                    initially composed or translated by an East Syrian Christian, and circulated
                    among members of this community from an early stage, whether in the Sasanian

                                >Book of Asaf</hi>” (<hi rend="italic">Aleph </hi>18:1 [2018])
                            reached my attention too late to substantially figure into this article.
                            In connection with Yoeli-Tlalim’s important contribution, I will
                            restrict myself to the following brief note. One of Yoeli-Tlalim’s
                            central findings is that the Syriac text attributed to “Aḥūdemmeh
                            Anṭīpaṭrōs” has a close parallel in a lengthy passage from the
                                Hebrew <hi rend="italic">Sefer Asaf</hi>. For Yoeli-Tlalim, this
                            (along with some other distinctly Iranian features of the text,
                            including month names and a history of science that parallels that of
                            Abū Sahl b. Nawbakht) indicates that <hi rend="italic">Sefer
                            Asaf</hi> derived, at least in part from “Syriac medical literature of
                            the Eastern Church in Persia” (Yoeli-Tlalim, “Exploring Persian Lore,”
                            138-145). At first glance, it may seem that the existence of this Hebrew
                            parallel poses complications for my main argument in this article--that
                            the similarity between these Syriac and Greek texts reflects the fact
                            that one was directly translated from the other. But although the
                            possibility that the Hebrew served as an intermediary between the Syriac
                            and the Greek cannot be ruled out, I do not find this likely; there is a
                            much greater incidence of texts moving between Syriac and Greek in late
                            antiquity than between Greek and Hebrew, and, as far as I know, no
                            secular text has been demonstrated to have gone either from Greek into
                            Hebrew, or from Hebrew into Greek, during this period. </p></note>*</p>

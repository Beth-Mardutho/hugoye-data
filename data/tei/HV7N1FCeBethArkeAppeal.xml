            <anchor corresp="P1"/>[1] In 2002,
    Beth Mardutho: The Syriac Institute launched The Syriac Digital
    Library Project—codenamed eBethArké—with the
    objective of creating the largest digital collection of Syriac
    manuscripts, books, journal articles, pictures and maps, and
    making all this material available on the Internet. During the
    past two centuries, the Syriac manuscript heritage was moved
    from the Middle East to Western libraries and museums; hundreds
    of books were published from these treasures. Now, for the
    first time, Beth Mardutho will bring together all this material
    from East and West, preserving Syriac manuscripts and printed
    books, and making them accessible worldwide. Students, clergy
    and seminarians, scholars, and the general public will be able
    to access the entire collection anytime from anywhere in the
    world. Our goal is to have 2,000-3,000 holdings in our library
    within three years. Your support is crucial to meet this
    objective.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P2"/>[2] In
    January 2004, The Catholic University of America (CUA) gave
    Beth Mardutho full access to digitize its Syriac collection,
    from March 1 until July 31. This small window of time—due
    to construction work at the library—should not be missed.
    CUA’s collection is indeed unique and one of its kind in
    North America. Beth Mardutho plans to secure scanning equipment
    and hire two students on full-time basis to have as many books
    as possible digitized for inclusion in The Syriac Digital
    Library. The budget for this task is around $35,000. We have
    already raised $10,000. Working together, we can raise the
    remaining $25,000 to funds this important project.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P3"/>[3] During
    2002 and 2003 we succeeded in building a coalition of library
    partners who agreed, like CUA, to give us access to their
    collections. This coalition includes the libraries of Brigham
    Young University, Brown University, Duke University,
    Harvard’s Dambarton Oaks, the Peshitta Institute of
    Leiden University, and Princeton Theological Seminary. Our
    partners have already contributed over 30,000 digitized images.
    During 2003, Beth Mardutho built a prototype interface for the
    eLibrary on the Internet.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P4"/>[4] Now, it
    is time to digitize CUA’s collection, by far the largest
    collection in our coalition group, and include it in The Syriac
    Digital Library for you and everyone else to use worldwide. We
    ask you to be part of this exciting work... To give everyone
    the opportunity to take part, we have devised various donation
    plans. All donations are tax-deductible (in the U.S. at least),
    and can be made online or by sending a chec:</p>

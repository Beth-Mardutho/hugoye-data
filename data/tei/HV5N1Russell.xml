    This paper examines passages in which
    St. Ephrem the Syrian makes use of the image of Jesus Christ as
    an infant child. It demonstrates that he uses this tool to
    support his full picture of the Incarnation, including both a
    stress on a fully divine Divinity and on a fully human
    humanity. This study also makes clear that Ephrem imagines that
    the experience of the Divine Word in being incarnate has close
    affinities with the common human experience we all share. This
    has an interesting effect on his picture of how the incarnation
    figures in the working out of human salvation. Ephrem's view of
    the Incarnation is shown to be imaginatively full, making use
    of the subjective as well as the objective elements in human
    life and nature.<lb/>


         <head xml:id="HV5N1Russell3">Introduction</head>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P1"/>[1]
    Christology is an area of Christian teaching that can be most
    clearly evaluated at certain critical points. A careful
    examination of a thinker's presentation of the Crucifixion, the
    Incarnation or the miracle working of Jesus in the Gospels
    serves to cast into high relief his treatment of the
    difficulties inherent in constructing a coherent theological
    treatment of Jesus. Whether it is by historical accident or
    because of the shock of meeting the Divine face-to-face as a
    human among humans, the history of Christian christological
    thinking is one of writers either proclaiming and defending a
    picture of Jesus that credits Him with an internal duality of
    nature or of their denying that duality in some particular.
    Since this contrasting pair of tendencies helps locate where
    the fault lines in Christian theological treatments of Jesus
    will be found, it is not surprising that so much attention has
    been paid to how patristic authors treat these <hi rend="italic">cruces</hi>.
    An opportunity for making paradigmatic choices confronts the
    theologian in the infancy of Jesus, which provides a vivid
    moment for contrasting the two natures of Christ, since human
    nature at this time of life is at its most passive and
    dependent, rendering the gulf between Creator and created in
    Jesus even wider than it usually appears. It is that strand:
    the infancy, in Ephrem the Syrian's discussions of Jesus that I
    would like to attempt to trace in this essay.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P2"/>[2] While
    many writers, especially of our own age, seem to skate lightly
    over this period in the life of Jesus, those from any period of
    Christian history who tackle it head-on often reveal the true
    tenor of their convictions. I have never forgotten the shock I
    felt on reading for the first time Cyril of Alexandria's
    aggressive treatment of the nativity scene:<note place="foot" xml:id="FN1" n="1">
                    <p rend="footnote text">

            <p>Neither do we say that the flesh was converted into the
      divine nature, nor surely that the ineffable nature of God
      the Word was debased and perverted into the nature of flesh,
      for he is unchangeable and unalterable, ever continuing
      altogether the same according to the Scriptures: but we say
      that the Son of God, while visible to the eyes, and a babe
      and in swaddling clothes, and still at the breast of his
      Virgin Mother, filled all creation as God, and was seated
      with his Father. For the divinity is without quantity and
      without magnitude and without limit.</p>
         </quote>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P3"/>[3] There
    are few writers in the history of Christian thought who are as
    clear and combative as Cyril, and few who know their own minds
    as well. Still, his use of the juxtaposition of the infant
    human child with unlimited divinity to make the incarnational
    paradox as acute as possible shows us how the infant Jesus can
    serve as a window into the mind of a Christian theologian
    treating that Gospel scene.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P4"/>[4] As part
    of an on-going examination of Ephrem's christological
    construct, I would like to see what tracing this theme in his
    writings will show us about his christological convictions and
    the manner in which he chooses to express them. We have no
    treatise, hymn or sermon of Ephrem's to read that focuses
    directly on this topic.<note place="foot" xml:id="FN2" n="2">
                    <p rend="footnote text">
             As one of the anonymous readers for <hi rend="italic">Hugoye</hi>
    noted, many of the passages this paper discusses come from the
    collection called <hi rend="italic">Hymns on the Nativity</hi>.  These
    works do not, however, focus on the image of the infant
    Jesus.  They seem to me to be a group of hymns that center
    on discussion of the Incarnation, which explains the appearance
    in them of Nativity scenes pertinent to this paper. 
    <hi rend="italic">The Hymns on the Nativity</hi>, as McVey says, are
    characterized by their theological focus: “The central
    theological theme of the <hi rend="italic">Hymns on the Nativity</hi> is
    Ephrem’s understanding of the incarnation as the
    miraculous and paradoxical self-abasement of God out of love
    for humankind.” (<hi rend="italic">Hymns</hi>, 30)</p>
                </note> In the writings that survive, and have been
    identified as being his, Ephrem makes use of the infant Jesus
    only as a support or parallel to other points he wishes to put
    forward. Because of the scattered and brief character of his
    comments on this theme, I think it best to treat them
    systematically according to the following three headings:<lb/>
    1. passages describing the infant Jesus as a human being.<lb/>
    2. passages describing the infant Jesus as Divine.<note place="foot" xml:id="FN3" n="3">
                    <p rend="footnote text">
             I have argued elsewhere for Ephrem’s
    insistence on the reality of the two natures, so I will treat
    that point as a settled fact. cf. Paul S. Russell,
    “A First Look at the Christology of Ephraem the
    Syrian” <hi rend="italic">Symposium Syriacum VII</hi>, ed. René
    Lavenant, SJ, <hi rend="italic">Orientalia Christiana Analecta</hi> 256 Roma:

                </note>
            <lb/>
    3. passages focusing directly on the theological meaning of the
    infant Jesus.<lb/>
    I am well aware of the danger we court in systematizing the
    works of early Christian authors anachronistically, but if we
    keep that pitfall in mind, I think this approach will prove to
    be helpful as we attempt to pull together the scattered pieces
    that express a picture in Ephrem's mind that is never fully
    articulated in any single place.<lb/>
         </p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P5"/>[5] It is
    worthy of note that Ephrem makes theological use of the infancy
    of Jesus any time he refers to it in his writings. I have found
    no appearance of the infant Jesus in Ephrem's works that does
    not use that image to make a point. This seems to indicate a
    belief on his part that this image of Jesus is one that not
    only has the power to figure in a theological argument, but is
    even an image that has such strong inherent theological weight
    that it cannot be passed over in silence.</p>

    the image of the infant Jesus is emphatic, in that the passage

         </quote>
         <p>The opening contrast of "Lord of David" with "Son of David"
    sets up the dual meaning of the swaddling clothes in these
    lines. Just as the same child is both a descendent of the great
    king of Israel and is his Lord, so are the swaddling clothes
    both a sign of helpless infancy and a means for the infant's
    active saving of the human race. What might have been merely
    evidence of weakness and passivity has become, instead, a means
    of active salvific action on the part of the Son. The infant
    Jesus thus shows us the saving paradox of the Incarnation in a
    clear and striking manner: the presence of the Divine nature
    makes the helplessness of the baby active in the salvation of
    humans while still leaving the helplessness unchanged. The
    careful reader will notice, too, that by making the focus of
    the contrast of nature the swaddling clothes, Ephrem has turned
    the attention of the listener to the detail that will serve to
    set up the starkest disjunction possible between the human and
    the Divine in Jesus.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P7"/>[7] This
    same gulf is emphasized again in the following passage, which

            <p>Because Simeon was able to carry in his weak arms the very
      majesty that created things cannot endure, he knew that his
      weakness was strengthened by the power he carried. At the
      same time Simeon, with all creatures, was invisibly being
      lifted up by the all-prevailing power of the Son Himself.
      This is amazing, that while a weak man was visibly carrying
      the power that gave him strength, that power was invisibly
      carrying the one who carried it. Majesty made itself small so
      that those who held it could endure it.<note place="foot" xml:id="FN6" n="6">

         <p>This meditation on the Bearer-of-All being small enough to
    be carried by Simeon shows Ephrem again playing on the
    passivity of the powerful and the paradox of Incarnation.
    Ephrem's centering the listener's attention on the most
    powerful aspect of the Son vis á vis the created world:
    His identity as its Creator and Sustainer, makes the care
    Simeon seems to exercise for, and the control he wields over,
    the baby Jesus as incongruous as possible. As with the
    swaddling clothes of the manger scene, this passage shows
    Ephrem plucking a detail out of a scriptural infancy scene and
    building his theological point and paradoxical contrast upon
    it. It should be clear how effective an interpretive method
    this is for the thinker who chooses his scriptural passages
    with care. The theological point flows out of and, in the mind
    of the listener, becomes integrated with the details that
    Ephrem uses. Surely, many of his audience must have had his
    interpretation recur to their minds when they had these scenes
    recalled to their attention in the future. It is reasonable to
    think that Ephrem fully intended his interpretation to take its
    place as part of the scriptural scene in the memories of his
    listeners.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P8"/>[8] In the
    next passage, Ephrem centers his use of the image on a more
    abstract quality of the incarnate Son: His identity as God's
    word.</p>

         <p>The unusual character of Jesus' infancy is shown
    here in two ways: one relating to His human nature and the
    other to His divine nature. His human nature is clearly out of
    the ordinary in Ephrem's mind, in that Jesus' silence does not
    render Him helpless, as one might expect. Instead, it is the
    beings created with the power of speech who have gotten their
    talkative selves in trouble by misusing that ability for
    speech.<note place="foot" xml:id="FN8" n="8">

                </note> The silent baby wields power over His talkative
    elders through the very means of His silence. The divine nature
    of Jesus experiences the Incarnation by entering that silent
    state that might seem to be the exact opposite of His nature as
    the Logos. This contrast of the silent baby with the creatures
    who are endowed with speech serves to remind Ephrem's listener
    that the incarnate Son is stepping completely out of His realm
    when He becomes one of us: from being the One Who is the source
    of all speech and thought, He must now be subjected to the
    inappropriate chattering of His own creations, which does not
    always please Him. The Divine Son's birth as a human being
    carries with it inconveniences that Ephrem is quick to point
    out as evidence of the absurdity of such an event.</p>

         <p>Ephrem is perfectly willing to imagine Jesus as a child
    among children, which might have been precisely the aspect of
    His childhood to upset a Nicene thinker who wished to support
    the idea of Jesus' natural uniqueness among human beings. It is
    interesting to see that Ephrem shows no signs of finding Jesus'
    status as a small child threatening to his ideas of Jesus'
    uniqueness. This degree of comfort with placing Jesus among
    children as one of them argues for Ephrem's acceptance of a
    broad view of the Incarnation, one that is not limited to the
    abstract questions of "nature" and "person" but also extends to
    the mundane details of human life.<note place="foot" xml:id="FN14" n="14">

             Some argued against the Council of Nicea by
    holding that the Son must be less than equal in Divinity to the
    Father because no fully Divine being could enter the created
    world.  Defenders of Nicea sometimes chose to counter this
    by striving to protect the Divine Son while incarnate by
    limiting the degree to which He was said to be affected by
    contact with the world [“he was in the crucified flesh
    impassibly making his own the sufferings of his own
    flesh”, as Cyril of Alexandria asserts in his <hi rend="italic">Third
    Letter to Nestorius</hi> (Translation found at 351 in
    Hardy,  <hi rend="italic">Christology</hi>) or, more crudely, in
    Athanasius’ extended treatment of the Incarnation and the
    scriptural passages illuminating it in his <hi rend="italic">Third Oration
    against the Arians</hi>, sec. 31, where he notoriously used the
    metaphor of a worker and his tool to describe the relation of
    God the Son to His human nature: “...afterwards, for our
    sakes He became man, and ‘bodily’, as the Apostle
    says, the Godhead dwelt in the flesh; as much as to say,
    ‘Being God, He had His own body, and using this as an
    instrument, He became man for our sakes.’” (trans.
    at 410 in NPNF IV, sec.ser.).  Nicenes might also choose
    to stress the uniqueness among human beings of the relationship
    of the physical self (the humanity) of the Son to His spiritual
    self (the Divinity), as Athanasius does in his <hi rend="italic">On the
    Incarnation</hi>: “For being himself mighty, and artificer
    of everything, he prepares the body in the virgin as a temple
    unto himself, and makes it his very own as an instrument, in it
    manifested, and in it dwelling.” (Sec. 8, translation at
    62-63 in Hardy, <hi rend="italic">Christology</hi>)].  While none of these
    ideas necessarily diminishes what its author allows as far as
    the fullness of the Incarnation is concerned, I think that they
    are instructive as indicators of philosophical, theological
    and, possibly, devotional qualms about speaking of the Divine
    as taking Its place in the created realm.  Against this
    backdrop of what seems, to me, to be quite general reluctance
    to place the incarnate Christ in the midst of ordinary human
    life, Ephrem’s willingness to speak cheerfully of the
    ordinariness of the incarnate Christ’s infancy makes me
    think that his acceptance of the idea of Incarnation has seeped
    very far down into his mind.  This openness to intimacy
    between the Divine and the created world seems, to me, to argue
    for a level of comfort with incarnation that was quite unusual
    among early Christian authors whose works survive.  (I
    would also place alongside this reluctance Arius’ desire
    to protect the inviolability of the fully Divine Father and
    Nestorius’ desire to keep ontological distance between
    the Divine Son and the human experiences of Jesus–though
    that is material for two monographs in itself and cannot be
    pursued here.)

    starkly along the lines of the distinction of the natures in

      divine Son of God or the completely normal human Jesus, he
      also has left himself the freedom to argue that Jesus is
      showing signs of enjoying extraordinary human
      characteristics. Thus, he has a larger selection of
      exegetical and christological tools in his belt than others
      of his conviction might possess. I hope that further study
      will reveal examples of how Ephrem imagines this human
      capacity of Jesus can be seen at work.</item>
            <item>The explicit crediting of Jesus with unusual human
      abilities seems to me to be evidence of confidence on
      Ephrem's part in the possibility of speaking freely of Jesus'
      humanity as having special qualities without that serving to
      inhibit his insistence on the presence of a real divine
      nature, also. I think this is evidence of the fact that
      Ephrem feels no competition between the human and divine
      natures in Jesus. He is willing to evaluate each as seems
      best to him without being afraid that too much credit offered
      to one might threaten the fullness or reality of the

    These references to the infant Jesus are not elaborate,
    certainly, most of them arising in passing rather than serving
    as the focus of a full exposition of their content, but I would
    suggest that they are adequate to show that Ephrem imagines the
    infant Jesus as living the normal human life of an infant
    child, at least as far as outward appearances and

    Jesus in with other children as he speaks of Him shows this, to
    my mind. I also think that the mention of Jesus in the lap of
    Joseph is indicative of a degree of comfort with Jesus'
    babyhood unusual in a Patristic author. For a writer to make
    many references to Jesus in the arms of Mary, His especially
    venerated Virgin Mother, would not have the impact of one
    reference to Jesus bouncing in the lap of Joseph, His pious and
    exemplary, but comparatively ordinary, step-father. Since the
    New Testament never speaks of Joseph holding Jesus, this
    picture, unlike Ephrem's mention of Simeon in the Temple, is
    the product of Ephrem's own mind. His willingness to imagine
    Jesus being treated as an infant child by more humans than
    comprise the short list of those mandated by Scripture, and
    apart from the insulating touch of the Blessed Virgin Mary,
    surely argues for real acceptance of the reality of Jesus'

             To my ears, the continuing elevation of the

    history of the Church seems like an unconscious attempt to
    insulate the passive, infant Jesus from the world into which He
    was born.  However that may be, Ephrem shows no urge to
    soften the incarnational paradox in that way.

    same person who was "among the infants as a baby" was also, as
    a baby, exercising divine powers no human could enjoy. The
    contrast of these two pictures is deepened by Ephrem's
    attribution of both categories of action to the same Babe
    rather than to different natures or spheres of action of the
    same person. In other words, Ephrem has spoken of the infant
    Jesus as a human being in a manner designed to heighten the
    incarnational paradox rather than to lessen it. Habitual
    readers of Ephrem will not be surprised by this conclusion.</p>

    one of his central christological convictions. The manner in
    which Ephrem's ideas about the infant Jesus are expressed in
    these lines shows, in my opinion, that Ephrem wishes to
    emphasize that the Divine Son was present in a personal way in
    Jesus. I mean "personal" here in the sense of 'as an
    individual' or 'in a way that involves Him personally'. This is
    shown clearly, for example, in Ephrem's assertion that, while
    Simeon goes through the motions of presenting the baby Jesus to
    God in the Temple according to the Jewish Law (Luke 2:21-35),
    it is, in actuality, Jesus Who is presenting Simeon to

    Ephrem makes full use of the shock value of attributing to the

         <p>In his following this train of thought, Ephrem's delight in
    placing together things that normally would oppose each other
    and in finding outrageous ways to express the duality of Jesus
    is clear. This is not evidence merely of a desire to shock his
    listeners, however, but rather marks the first step in the
    development of an important theme in Ephrem's work. Ephrem
    focuses on the contrast between humanity and divinity, between
    the extreme helplessness of the new-born human and the
    limitless power of the fully Divine Son of God, in order to
    impress that duality of natures in Christ on the mind of his
    listener. Ephrem is not delighting in apparent absurdities for
    their own sakes, but is providing, instead, a building block
    for the final and most important aspect of his use of this
    image. It is the religious or practical meaning of this
    juxtaposition of natures that most strongly appeals to Ephrem's
    imagination and explains his interest in the infant Jesus.
    Ephrem is not nearly as interested in talking about what the
    infant Jesus is in the abstract as he is in talking about how
    the image of the infant Jesus can shed light in practical ways

    section 51, quoted above in paragraph 7. When Ephrem says:
    "Majesty made itself small so that those who held it could

    Incarnation, but also of its purpose. The gulf which had

         <p>The image here is clearly one of the Divine
    Person entering into the created world and taking up residence
    in it, instead of merely suffusing it with His presence or
    presiding over it, as the Divine had done before that change.
    This dwelling in the midst of Creation, as a part of it, makes
    God the Son close to, and available to, the surrounding
    creatures in a way that was not possible before. The presence
    of the Son here is a "personal" one that involves Him as a
    complete whole. The contrast between the insight this expresses
    and that expressed by, for example, Theodore of Mopsuestia when
    he speaks of the divine nature in Christ indwelling the

    Ephrem imagines the Son entering into the created world as a
    person in it, while Theodore's idea seems to be that the Son
    has drawn close enough to creation to associate Himself with
    it, but not in a manner that commits Him to it holistically,
    beyond what He desires at any moment. This new situation is a
    radical departure from what Ephrem understood to have been the
    previous relationship between God and Creation, and Ephrem is
    convinced that this Divine entry into Creation has begun a new
    era as far as the breadth of the horizon open to human beings
    is concerned. The infancy of Jesus provides a starting point
    for Ephrem's discussion of these new possibilities because it
    offers such striking evidence of this new closeness.</p>

                </note> Both of these
    connections require that Ephrem imagines that the humanity
    Jesus displays is at least congruent with that displayed by the
    rest of humankind. More than just throwing up contrasts between
    Jesus and the rest of human nature to make theological points,
    Ephrem also wants to make use of the fact that Jesus is a man
    among His own kind and can fittingly be classed with the rest
    of us. This multi-directional use of Jesus' humanity (that is,
    both to connect Him to us as one of us, as well as to connect
    human nature and the created world to the Divine) is further
    evidence of Ephrem's ready acceptance of the full reality of
    Jesus' human nature that we noted above.</p>

            <anchor corresp="P20"/>[20]
    Thus, some of the meaning of the image of the infant Jesus for
    Ephrem lies in its ability to shed light on the larger history
    of the life of Christ among human beings and of the history of
    God's relations with human beings. In that sense, the infant
    Jesus could properly be described as 'typical' or 'iconic' in
    the mind of Ephrem. Rather than viewing this stage of Jesus'
    life as something awkward over which he would like to skate
    lightly, Ephrem sees in the image of the infant Jesus support
    for some of his most central christological convictions. The
    infant Jesus, then, takes His place toward the center of
    Ephrem's christological understanding rather than on its
    periphery.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P21"/>[21] An
    indication of this is found in Ephrem's speaking of salvation
    as stemming from the infant Jesus as well as the adult. Ephrem
    does not only speak of Christ on the Cross as being the Savior;
    in his mind, it is also appropriate to say this of the baby
    Jesus.<note place="foot" xml:id="FN33" n="33">

         <p>The contrast of "the Infant of days" with "the
    Ancient of Days" may distract us from this fact of the infant
    being described as mediator. This role must hinge, logically,
    on Jesus' enjoyment of the duality of natures and His
    consequent ability to serve as a bridge over the gulf between
    God and the world. Because the bridge is created only by the
    Son's incarnation, the infant Jesus would naturally attract
    this sort of comment from Ephrem. He would be likely to reflect
    on that aspect of the Incarnation with reference to the Christ
    child since the gulf being bridged is a prominent piece of
    Ephrem's mental furniture, so bypassing it is an important
    change in the ontological order of things. This way of speaking
    should make us aware of the fact that Ephrem's christological
    thought is very strongly incarnation-centered, to the point
    that he is able to see salvation in the Incarnation itself as
    well as in the work of Christ on the Cross.<note place="foot" xml:id="FN34" n="34">

         <p>Ephrem's decision to pluck details out of the
    birth narrative that allow him to contrast Christ enrolling
    people in the Book of Life with Caesar's taxation bureaucracy
    is another example of his preference for the most extreme
    contrasts between the Divine and human elements in the life of
    Jesus, even beyond those relating to Jesus' own duality. The
    strength of Ephrem's identification of Christ's salvific role
    with the infant Jesus is shown in the fact that, not only does
    he step back to look at the larger picture of salvation history
    when considering the newborn child, but he also is willing to
    delve into the humble details of the manger scene and find
    salvation expressed in them. That is, Ephrem does not step out
    of the story of the infant Jesus to make his theological
    points; he makes use of that tale in a way that shows that he
    finds it supportive of his christological convictions rather
    than embarrassing to them.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P23"/>[23]
    Ephrem draws from these scenes centering on the infant Jesus
    both high and abstract theological points (<hi rend="italic">Hymns on the
    Nativity</hi> 5.3, quoted above in paragraph 17) as well as
    grasping at background details of the stories to set forth the
    same duality in Christ he wishes to stress (as in his use of
    the Roman census as a counterpoint to the Book of Life in
    Heaven). The starting point of his interpretation is the
    contrast of the humanity of Jesus with His divine nature. This
    is true with all these scriptural passages, and of his use of
    the moments in the life of the baby Jesus that he conjures up
    out of his mind, as he does with Jesus sitting in Joseph's lap.
    This emphasis is clear in the following passage, where Ephrem
    speaks of the swaddling clothes of the baby in the manger as
    the means of offering salvation to human beings.<note place="foot" xml:id="FN36" n="36">

         <p>This reinforces the importance of the act of Incarnation in
    Ephrem's theological <hi rend="italic">schema</hi>, which we have noted before,
    placing emphasis again on its salvific nature. These lines help
    the reader understand, also, the theological valuation Ephrem
    places on the new connections the Incarnation opens between God
    and the world. This connection does not only offer comforting
    closeness to God for creatures or an easy flow of information
    from God to the world, it is a link that makes divine salvation
    available to us. The Incarnation is, then, a connection with
    the most important practical results of any that a religious
    view of life could imagine. If Ephrem wishes to stress the
    importance of the Divine/human connection, the infancy of Jesus
    provides a particularly attractive opportunity: it contains all
    of the potential for a discussion of the union of Divine and
    human that any stage of the life of Christ would provide, but,
    because Jesus is physically inactive during His infancy, that
    period helps the writer avoid being distracted by the problem
    of explaining actions that seem to contain both Divine and
    human elements. The field is clear to focus directly on the
    <hi rend="italic">union</hi> of God and the Creation. Ephrem takes full
    advantage of this chance to speak of the effects of the union,
    itself, on the human predicament. Elsewhere, he is happy to

    approaching the question of the manner of the Son's identity
    with Jesus as a philosophical problem or a doctrinal crux, he
    seems to view it as an experience that was deeply (and
    holistically) personal for the Son, and one that has deeply
    personal effects for God's own sense of His connection with
    human beings.<note place="foot" xml:id="FN41" n="41">

                </note> So Ephrem can say to the Son:</p>
         <quote>
            <p>Have mercy, O Lord, on my children! In my children call to
      mind Thy childhood, Thou Who wast a child! Let them that are
      like Thy childhood, be saved by Thy grace!</p>
         </quote>
         <p>Thoughtful consideration of this passage makes
    clear that Ephrem understands the infancy (and Incarnation) of
    the Savior not as mechanically working out the necessary steps
    toward our salvation, nor as a pleasingly clear case-study of
    christological truths, but as a real break-through in the
    inter-personal relations of God with humans. After the
    childhood of Jesus, Ephrem finds that he can appeal to God for
    mercy on the basis of their shared experience of childhood!
    Nothing could be more complete or holistically personal than
    this effect of the idea of God becoming a human being.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P27"/>[27] This
    must be the fullest understanding of the Incarnation possible,
    for it goes far beyond insisting that God the Son be understood
    to have entered personally into the created realm and speaks of
    Him as having gone through the experiences of human life in a
    way comparable to our own. In other words, Ephrem does not just
    insist that God the Son made Himself present for the normal
    events of a human life, he also believes that these experiences
    drew forth from Him the same sort of reactions that they do
    from us. How else could he call on the Son's memory of
    childhood in the hopes of awakening mercy through stirring up
    nostalgia? This is, indeed, an understanding of Jesus that
    proclaims His real humanity, for it envisions a humanity that
    is both external and formal, as well as internal and
    experiential. Jesus, on this pattern, not only enjoys both
    divine and human nature, but His divine nature experiences the
    human nature <hi rend="italic">as a human experiences it</hi>, not just in the
    midst of human beings.<note place="foot" xml:id="FN42" n="42">

             A possible analogue would be that of an
    adult playing a game with children, participating with them and
    following the same rules, while inwardly thinking of other
    things and engaging in an adult interior life, as opposed to
    the picture Ephrem seems to support, according to which the
    adult would experience the game <hi rend="italic">as the children do</hi>, with
    complete self-involvement and no thought for anything else.

         </p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P28"/>[28] So,
    in the end, it seems that Ephrem finds in the image of the
    infant Jesus two principal lessons.</p>
         <list type="ordered">
            <item>Since the bridging of the gulf between God and the world
      was the making of the salvation of mankind, the Incarnation
      itself can be called salvific, and since the gulf was bridged
      most spectacularly and completely during the infancy of Jesus
      when, even among human beings, Jesus was naturally humble and
      passive, the infancy of Jesus provides a special opportunity
      for emphasizing and meditating on this miraculous
      self-humiliation. Thence does the manger become a place of
      salvation in Ephrem's mind along with the Cross on
      Calvary.</item>
            <item>If the involvement of God in the world is the result of
      the Incarnation, then the more complete and absorbing that
      involvement was, the more complete and effective was its
      result. Because of this, Ephrem's interest in the idea of the
      Son's holistic, personal involvement in the human life of
      Jesus can be seen as more than just an enjoyment in playing
      with striking images, but an attempt to show that, if at the
      time of Judgement, the Son could look back on His human youth
      with something akin to human nostalgia, His judgement would
      be affected and our fates possibly altered.</item>
         </list>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P29"/>[29] The
    full, personal involvement of the Divine Son in human
    experience thus offers a very special kind of bridging of the
    gulf between Creator and creature: one that reaches beyond mere
    presence, or even ontological identification, to the more
    mysterious, but perhaps more unifying, level of personal
    empathy. If God the Son, after His human life as Jesus, can
    look back on that time in the world in a manner congruous with
    our own reminiscences, that, perhaps more than anything else,
    puts Him among us as one of us human beings. This is the point
    at which Ephrem's christological use of the image of the infant
    Jesus moves beyond supporting a Nicene conviction in the full
    divinity of the Son and His full human nature, and begins to
    depict the Incarnation in a way that imagines a human
    experience of life for the Son much like our own. Since this
    possibility was one that Nicene Christians seemed to have shied
    away from imagining,<note place="foot" xml:id="FN43" n="43">
                    <p rend="footnote text">
             e.g., Cyril of Alexandria, with whom we
    began, speaks thus: (<hi rend="italic">Third Letter to Nestorius</hi>, 72a,
    translation at 304 in Stevenson, <hi rend="italic">Creeds</hi>) “We
    confess also that the very Son, which was begotten of God the
    Father, and is the only-begotten God, though being in his own
    nature impassible, suffered for us in the flesh, according to
    the scriptures, and was in his Crucified Body impassibly
    appropriating and making his own the sufferings of his own
    flesh.”, which, whatever else it may be, is not a
    description of the experience of being incarnate that accords
    much with the common human experience of life, at least as I
    have lived it. 
         </p>
                </note> Ephrem's happy embrace of it is unusual,
    at least. It seems to show some parallel between his thoughts
    and those of modern Christians who speak of Jesus' significance
    as stemming from His own human experience.<note place="foot" xml:id="FN44" n="44">
                    <p rend="footnote text">
             This must be the instinct lying behind
    reflections such as:  “Can a male savior save
    women?”, the Antoinette Brown lecture for women in
    ministry, delivered by Kwok Pui-lan of Harvard Divinity School
    at the Vanderbilt Divinity School Chapel, March, 2001. . Many
    other examples of the same concern could be discovered.
    
         </p>

         </p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P30"/>[30]
    Ephrem sees in the infant Jesus both clear evidence of the two
    natures coexisting in one Person, as the Nicene writers were
    coming to speak of, but also another, deeper understanding of
    what the Incarnation must have meant to Him Who experienced it.
    Turning those two points over in his mind will help the modern
    reader see the Incarnation, at least to some degree, through
    Ephrem's eyes. It is a picture that helps us understand why
    Christology looms so large in his theological understanding.
    What could be big enough to cast into the shade this image of
    the Judge-of-All bouncing on the knee of Joseph and being
    crooned to by His mother? Those scenes cast long shadows in
    Ephrem's imagination. Would not the recollection of personal
    experience make that Judge more ready to view with indulgent
    understanding the faults of His fellows whose lives He knew
    from the inside out, from birth to death, not as an eye-witness
    and companion, but as One Who, Himself, knew all these moments
    as His own? Ephrem was convinced that it would. It is the
    picture in his mind of the real human experience of the Judge
    of All that stands out as the source of his hope for salvation.
    If God the Son really knows, Himself, what it is to be a human,
    Ephrem thinks, surely He will look on us with indulgence when
    the time for Judgement comes.</p>_______<lb/>

         <p>This passage is, theologically at least, an
    echo of a famous earlier piece of Athanasius’ <hi rend="italic">On the
    Incarnation</hi> (sec. 17) “For he was not, as might be
    imagined, circumscribed in the body, nor, while present in the
    body, was he absent elsewhere; nor, while he moved the body,
    was the universe left void of his working and providence; but,
    thing most marvelous, Word as he was, so far from being
    contained by anything, he rather contained all things himself;
    ... thus, even while present in a human body and himself
    quickening it, he was, without inconsistency, quickening the
    universe as well...” (trans. at 70-71 in Hardy,
    <hi rend="italic">Christology</hi>), but I did not meet that earlier writing,
    myself, until after having seen Cyril’s letter, so it is
    from Cyril that my interest in this aspect of Christology
    stems. <ref target="#FNRef1">

         <p>My interest in this paper is in the use Ephrem
    makes of one particular image to express his conviction that
    this “miraculous and paradoxical self-abasement”
    was real and must be held to firmly and fully for Christianity
    to be correctly understood.  Not all Christian writers who
    hold to the full divinity of the Son are comfortable with His
    full, personal involvement in human life as Jesus. 
    Ephrem’s desire to hold together these two convictions
    is, I think, the central element of his Christology. <ref target="#FNRef2">

         <p>In an age of theological, especially
    christological, controversy, teaching doctrine at a relatively
    high level to laity becomes a necessary activity in a way that
    is not true during more settled periods.  This is a likely
    explanation for the high level of Christian discourse in the
    Fourth and Fifth centuries as opposed to that of more settled
    times. <ref target="#FNRef39">

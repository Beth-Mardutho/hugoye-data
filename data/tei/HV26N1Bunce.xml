                <p xml:lang="en">John of Ephesus did not merely catalog events but employed
                    stylistic and organizational techniques to contextualize and direct his
                    narrative. This is made apparent by the presentation of a series of clerical
                    trials in the first book of his <hi rend="italic">Ecclesiastical History.
                    </hi>The <hi rend="italic">Ecclesiastical History</hi> should be understood as
                    playing a complementary role to his <hi rend="italic">Lives of the Eastern
                        Saints</hi>. Where the latter work presented the charismatic credentials of
                    miracle-working saint-ascetics, the former showed the institutional soundness of
                    the miaphysite hierarchy. He demonstrated this negatively through a chaotic
                    account of the legal practices of the Chalcedonians. </p>

                    proceedings was an attack on the institutional legitimacy of the Chalcedonian
                    church. It was the most viable challenge to Chalcedonian patriarchs John
                    Scholasticus and Eutychius and their imperially sanctioned enforcement of union.
                    By contrast, it strengthened the legitimacy of the embattled miaphysites. John
                    of Ephesus sought to expose fraud, lawlessness, and wilfulness in the
                    Chalcedonians' legal process, thereby systematically undermining the intention,
                    process, and outcome of legal proceedings against the miaphysites.</p>

                    Stephen the presbyter’s protestation before an unnamed Roman prefect.<note

                                focus of the following argument is the relationship of the
                                Chalcedonian faction represented in Constantinople by patriarchs
                                John Scholasticus and Eutychius, and the Severan faction represented
                                by John of Ephesus, Paul of Antioch, and various other bishops and
                                presbyters who will be mentioned throughout the article. Despite an
                                arguable lack of precision, I shall very commonly refer to the two
                                groups as Chalcedonians and miaphysites. For accounts of the
                                diversity and its significance, especially in the latter position

                    his <hi rend="italic">Ecclesiastical History</hi>, almost begins with this
                    passion narrative; a crowd dragged the cleric before an official. After a brief
                    exchange, Stephen’s case was transferred to the “Synodite” (Chalcedonian)
                    bishop, who confined Stephen in such poor conditions that he died in squalor.
                    The Severans who buried him treated his body as that of a martyr, and by this
                    treatment, made clear that they at least did not believe he had died of natural
                    causes. With this opener, John of Ephesus directly confronted the perceived
                    paradox of Christian persecution in a Christian empire.</p>

                    Humfress states, for example, that the legal framing of heresy and orthodoxy
                    “necessitated the legal categorization and systematization of religious belief
                        itself.”<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn5" n="4"><p rend="footnote text"

                    thinking were not only impositions of state power as a means of church
                    governance. Instead, they came also to be recognized internally as valid methods
                    of a doctrinal definition. Beyond doctrine, the church adopted the systems and
                    definitions of Roman law for its everyday functions. For example, Farag
                    discusses the complicated history of the church’s use of the classical juristic
                    conception of <hi rend="italic">res sacra</hi>. Despite some to-and-fro on the
                    subject, the simultaneous processes of adoption by the church and imposition by
                    imperial legislation of significant elements of an idea first formulated to
                    govern the property of pre-Christian temples show the draw and influence of
                    Roman law on the church.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn6" n="5"><p

                    not only subject to legislation but also became a significant author of its own
                    law. The creation of canons provided forensic blueprints against which orthodoxy
                    and heterodoxy could be tested. It was increasingly a model of orthodoxy
                    generated by legal means that individuals conformed to or fell short of. One
                    example of this can be seen in the excommunication of Nestorius at the Council
                    of Ephesus in 431. While the issues at stake were theological, the method, at
                    least according to Nestorius, was forensic but flawed: “I was summoned by Cyril,
                    who had assembled the Council […]. Who was judge? Cyril. Who was the accuser?
                        Cyril.”<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn9" n="8"><p

                        </p></note> Thomas Graumann rightly points out that Nestorius “expects his
                    audience to recognize [that proper procedure had been violated] and share his
                    expectations of due process.”<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn10" n="9"><p

                <p xml:lang="en">At the risk of generalization, the focus on formally necessary
                    elements, determined by a legal intellectual context and shored up by knowledge
                    of Roman law, was a regular feature of contested theology in Late Antiquity.
                    However, as we shall encounter in John of Ephesus’ account, most concerns with
                    this method were found not in the forensic form but in its misuse. </p>
                <p xml:lang="en">As they were contestable, trials were considered final only in a
                    limited manner. The Council of Chalcedon of 451 ended neither the Christological
                    debate, nor the existence of miaphysite clergy and their congregations. Indeed,
                    John of Ephesus’ <hi rend="italic">Ecclesiastical History</hi> was composed
                    between 571 and 585, over one hundred years after the council. Of course, this
                    is by no means the most enduring result of Chalcedon, but it does affirm the
                    continuation of the dispute to some degree among bishops in the Roman Empire.
                    Given the circumstance of this theological dispute, the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Ecclesiastical History</hi> is partially an apologetic, which wrestles with
                    the implications of being ruled outside the Chalcedonian church. Like Nestorius,
                    John questioned the formal validity of the processes that confirmed the ruling
                    against him and his fellow miaphysites, thereby questioning the legitimacy of
                    the ruling itself. John’s interest in the formal aspects of legal definitions of
                    orthodoxy and communion, from the exact procedures <hi rend="italic">of</hi> and
                    the necessary individuals <hi rend="italic">for </hi>rulings of orthodoxy to the
                    precise words to be used <hi rend="italic">in</hi> ecclesiastical government,
                    will be a central theme of this article.</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">However, John’s focus on the above elements is not told to us
                    explicitly but is rather a point made apparent by literary means. John has
                    particularly shaped the first book of his history as an ever more outrageous
                    catalog of abuses by Chalcedonian enforcers against miaphysite clerics. The
                    effect is that the legal process and its misuse are brought to the reader’s
                    attention both by a statement of fact and by the manner of presentation. Thus,
                    not merely by the cataloguing of the events themselves but also by the form of
                    expression, we are encouraged to agree with John’s assessment of the
                    institutional validity of his church and fellow bishops and the corresponding
                    invalidity of the Chalcedonians. Muriel Debié has encouraged the reading of
                    Syriac historians as literary agents, but the focus of this agency has perhaps
                    been too narrowly on their purposes in developing a cultural identity.<note

                    identity, if we are to properly appreciate the full range of purposes that
                    motivated these authors, it remains undoubtedly important to consider the
                    immediate practical purposes of Syriac historians. For this task, it is
                    essential that we bear in mind their literary methods. An assessment of Tacitus’
                        <hi rend="italic">Annals </hi>that ignored his authorial decision to focus
                    on legionary rebellions in the first book would not be able to explain the

                    would preclude any assessment of a potential disparity between his extensive

                    analyse his method, we would be in a weaker position to determine his purpose.
                    Matters of literary form are undoubtedly crucial in an account of the literary
                    agency of Tacitus as a historian. Attention to the structure of John’s work in
                    this essay seeks to continue the process of affording the same fulness of agency
                    to Syriac historians.</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">The increasing entanglement of Roman legal and intra-ecclesial
                    conflict resolution is typified in Justinian’s novels, which frequently deal
                    with matters of church government. While relying on canons as a source of
                    evidence for right practice in ecclesiastical matters, they nevertheless produce
                    their own normative statements in support of the canons’ contents and the
                    authority of canons as legally binding in ecclesiastical matters.<note

                                following three examples show three different relationships: 1) the
                                regulation of clerics in a civic context, 2) the regulation of
                                monastic rules themselves by the imperial government and 3) imperial
                                support of internal canonical regulation. N. 3 (535) limits the
                                number of clergy in the principal church of the city to 420. N. 5
                                (535) provides monastic regulation. N. 6 (535) states that the
                                canonical regulation of ordination has the force of secular
                                law.</hi></p></note> Altogether, the approach is not so much merely
                    belt and braces, but indeed belt <hi rend="italic">as </hi>braces and vice
                    versa; canon law and secular law regulate the same things, and often refer to
                    the authority of the other source in defence of their stipulations. Therefore,
                    it is unsurprising that John of Ephesus was keen to document the ongoing legal
                    and semi-legal processes that established orthodoxy in the
                    Chalcedonian-miaphysite dispute. In such a context, the validity of either
                    side’s position was highly dependent on correct process.</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">John of Ephesus was not a disinterested third party in these
                    proceedings but was personally involved in the trials, mediations, and reported
                    injustices of the persecutions under Justin II and his successor Tiberius II.
                    Raised in Amida’s “eastern miaphysite monasticism,” John claims that he led
                    imperial missionary appointments in 542 under Justinian, which earned him the
                    title “who is over the heathen” (<foreign xml:lang="syr">ܕܥܠ ܚܢ̈ܦܐ</foreign>)
                    and “idol breaker” (<foreign xml:lang="syr">ܡܬܒܪ ܦܬܟܪ̈ܐ</foreign> ), and was

                    marginalization and persecution of the miaphysite hierarchies by Justinian’s
                    successors. John of Ephesus’ fortune was varied. Under Justinian, he had been an
                    important agent in the evangelistic mission in Anatolia. Under Justin II, he was
                    an imprisoned and marginalized prelate whose position as bishop of Ephesus was
                    now titular in the barest sense of the word.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn15"

                    become the building blocks of orthodoxy, must be acknowledged to be extremely
                    careful. Brooks’ uncharitable characterization of John as “not a literary

                    structured his history to present increasingly chaotic and informal proceedings
                    in the reign of Justin II against the miaphysites. Thus, he undermined the
                    forensic process of orthodoxy and the strong contemporary position of the
                    Chalcedonians by calling into question the validity of their formally irregular
                    activities. He thereby sought to justify in his work the refusal of miaphysite
                    clergy to accept the council of Chalcedon and its enforcement by rendering the
                    legal practices of its proponents suspect.</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">However, this aim must be refined a little further. John of
                    Ephesus’ administrative roles in the 540s and his high degree of education make
                    it seem certain that he could have written his history in Greek. Debié has
                    written that, through his appointments and education, John had “un hellénisme

                    In that work, he established the credentials of his miaphysite subjects as

                <p xml:lang="en">The work as a whole was divided into three sections, which were in
                    turn subdivided into books. Although the first two sections of the text, which
                    covered all history from Adam to Justinian I, are largely missing, except as
                    quotation in later chroniclers, the third part in six books, which handles
                    contemporary events, remains largely intact. Although the text of this third
                    section is incomplete, John’s structural efforts can still be seen in books one
                    and two of the extant text. These are marked as a unified production by a
                    self-conscious restart at the outset of book three. The dating undertaken by
                    Cureton and presented in the preface to his edition offers <hi rend="italic"
                        >termini post quos </hi>based on the events of the narrative, which,
                    although given as dates of composition, by no means preclude the alternative
                    suggested above, namely that books one and two were composed together before
                    book 3.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn22" n="21"><p
                                ><hi> Ibid., vi.</hi></p></note> The internal dating puts book one
                    after 581 and book two after 577. Given that the two books seem to have been
                    composed together but that the first deals with later events, these dates alone,
                    which demonstrate a non-chronological approach to his subject matter, argue for
                    John’s deliberate presentation of material. Books 3-6 will be largely excluded,
                    firstly because they are not the product of the same effort as the first two
                    books, and secondly because their concern moves away from trial scenes. It would
                    be unfair to allow the disruptive circumstances of John’s life, which caused his
                    history to be written piecemeal, to give a falsely disrupted sense of his work.
                    This would be false in that when circumstances allowed and John wrote
                    continuously, such as in books 1 and 2, his writing was not marked by “some
                    confusion in his narrative, some repetitions, and apparent contradictions” but
                    instead demonstrates structural and thematic coherency.<note place="foot"

                    charge of contravention of the canons of Chalcedon. The punishment demanded was
                    deposition from their episcopal seats, internal exile, and the repossession of

                    likewise defends Tiberius II as Caesar, documenting his rebuke of the patriarch
                    John Scholasticus for persecuting the miaphysites upon his admission that “they

                    of the measures of Novel 42 might have been necessitated as an indication of
                    good-will to Rome: “Justinian war aber nicht nur Theologe, sondern auch Kaiser …

                    Justinian balanced contemporary political considerations with his theological
                    intentions. Thus, for example, he has likewise characterized the early period of
                    Justinian’s reign (532-536) by both a sensitivity to the position of the Roman
                    church following the Acacian schism and the continued need to reconcile the

                        [1976]).</p></note> As an example of the complex relationship, Grazianskij
                    considers the appointment of Anthimus as the patriarch of Constantinople.
                    Formerly, this appointment has generally been thought of as either an example of
                    Justinian’s shrewd ecclesiastical politics or the result of Theodora’s
                    interference. Grazianskij argues that a reassessment of the sources rules out
                    the latter option.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn33" n="32"><p

                    suppose that Justinian exclusively favoured the Chalcedonians, then Anthimus’
                    appointment had little to commend it. Anthimus’ translation from Trebizond
                    rendered his position in Constantinople canonically suspect, and he favoured
                    compromise over total Chalcedonian victory. He was, therefore, neither legally
                    nor doctrinally bulletproof from a Chalcedonian perspective. Grazianskij
                    proposes that this was deliberate. It provided Justinian with the possibility of
                    the reconciliation of the parties around a mutually agreed position and with an
                    easy, non-doctrinal reason for his deposition should the negotiations fail.<note

                <p xml:lang="en">For our current purposes, two conclusions should be drawn from
                    this. Firstly, it demonstrates the practically-oriented ambivalence of
                    Justinian’s policy. John may have harboured hope of future favour if the
                    miaphysites could provide a reasonable path to unity. Secondly, it again
                    demonstrates the (ab)use of legal mechanisms in the church disputes of the 6<hi
                        rend="superscript">th</hi> century. </p>
                <p xml:lang="en">Nevertheless, however justified his position might have seemed
                    through a practical consideration of recent history, it is still equally correct
                    to read John’s denial of imperial responsibility as an endorsement of the
                    imperial system. Indeed, this is a key aspect of John of Ephesus’
                    historiography. Debié gives John’s account of Zʿura, a Syriac saint-ascetic in
                    Constantinople, as characteristic of the opinion of both John and the whole
                    Severan church. Zʿura’s refutation of Justinian’s authority is taken as
                    indicative of a wholesale move in the Syriac church: “the Syrian Orthodox
                    transferred their regard to a religious, spiritual, and eschatological
                        level”.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn35" n="34"><p

                    otherwise. Firstly, Zʿura’s disavowal is his own and not John’s. As argued by
                    Philip Wood, “<hi rend="italic">parrhesia</hi>” (<foreign xml:lang="gr"
                        >παρρησία</foreign>) is a highly significant trait, but it is also quite

                    He should not, therefore, be read as a mouthpiece for John. This leads to the
                    point that, secondly, Zʿura wields a charismatic authority appropriate to the
                        <hi rend="italic">Lives of the Eastern Saints</hi> but out of place in the
                    court politics and institutional wrangling of the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Ecclesiastical History</hi>. Indeed, Wood points out that his parrhesia’s
                    purpose was not to win the political dispute but to inspire the population.<note

                    not manifested in nuanced argument; characteristically, Zʿura challenged the
                    ‘synod’ not using argument, but by cursing Justinian: (<foreign xml:lang="syr"

                    tells us that Zʿura’s subsequent curing of Justinian rendered the emperor
                    amenable to Zʿura on all points but church organization. This account of the
                    rehabilitation of Justinian from demoniac to the holy man’s awe-filled confidant
                    suggests that, at this earlier stage in his life, John appears not to have
                    accepted in every instance the Chalcedonian claim that his church was
                    acephalous. Still hoping for an imperial change of heart, John's later
                    articulation of the kingship of Christ within his church was not the only avenue
                    he pursued.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn40" n="39"><p

                <p xml:lang="en">An ideological consideration is necessary, given John’s personal
                    experience of persecution, imprisonment, and destitution. In other words, given
                    that John frequently suffered at the hands of the emperors, we must ask why he
                    was so positive about them. Indeed, when detailing the supposed demonic
                    possession of Justin II at the beginning of book three, John explicitly stated
                    that his earlier circumlocution of the issue throughout the second book was out
                    of loyalty to the imperial office: “So that it not be considered as if for the
                    shame or disgrace of the high institution of kingship” (<foreign xml:lang="syr"

                    This is further evidence of John’s hope to preserve the reputation and position
                    of the earthly king, and suggests that his assessment of the imperial
                    institution is positive by default. Van Ginkel has argued that the <hi

                    can explain John’s sometimes inconsistent approach to his imperial subjects:
                    “When writing during the life of Justin II, John blamed most of the evil deeds
                    of his reign on his advisors. But in chapters written after his death, the
                    emperor is held fully responsible and justly punished (mental derangement) to
                    save him from a worse fate.”<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn42" n="41"><p

                    was the language of ecclesiastical history writing. It seems likely that John’s
                    adaption of this genre for a Syriac-language work was nevertheless a significant
                    choice. While considerations of the audience might explain his choice of
                    language, his choice of genre is remains best described as a product of his
                    cultural <hi rend="italic">Romanitas</hi>. Leppin’s description of John’s
                    pro-Roman account as the product of a writer “attached” to the empire is
                    undoubtedly correct, but it needs further substantiation.<note place="foot"

                    was discovered to have done so by his jailors. Upon his confession of
                    authorship, the emperor and patriarch threatened him with death, apparently with
                    added vehemence for his slander of the Roman state: “There were threats of death
                    against him for this reason: that he had included in [the writing] indictments
                    of Rome” (<foreign xml:lang="syr">ܠܘ̇ܚ̈ܡܐ ܕܡ̇ܘܬܐ ܗ̣ܘܘ ܥܠܘܗܝ. ܟܕ ܠܗܕܐ ܘܐܦ

                    Paul of Antioch was no less a Roman than John, yet this did not preclude this
                    same criticism of Rome from being absent in John’s work. Although it is not
                    clear what is meant by “criticism of Rome”, we should certainly differentiate
                    this from criticism of its inhabitants, imperial or otherwise, for John’s work
                    certainly did contain the latter. John’s continued hope for the rehabilitation
                    of the emperor is the explanation for this difference in approach.
                    Alternatively, we might understand Paul’s antagonism towards Rome as a
                    particularly unwelcome criticism of the imperial family. In that case, this
                    could be explained by his complex relations with Athanasius, his opponent in
                    Alexandria, and a descendant of Empress Theodora.<note place="foot"

                    laid squarely with lower officials, many of whom John believed guilty of
                    paganism themselves. Although they are not equated explicitly with the
                    Chalcedonian party, John noted the location of the trial to create a link
                    between this miscarriage of justice and Chalcedonian theology: “and [the
                    appointed judges] were sitting and examining the matter in the great palace of
                    the kingdom that was called Placidia for many days” (<foreign xml:lang="syr"

                    but definite indication by John of where he saw the problem. </p>
                <p xml:lang="en">In John’s case, rather than the emperor, it is the Chalcedonian
                    clergy who are charged explicitly with deceit, perjury, and breaking oaths:
                    “promises of deceit and oaths of falsehood of those against us; we know that
                    there is no truth with them” (<foreign xml:lang="syr">ܫܘ̈ܘܕܝܐ ܕܢܟܠ̣ܐ ܘܡ̈ܘܡܬܐ

                    Therefore, it is unsurprising that earlier ecclesiastical struggles are framed
                    as created by hostile clerics, not the emperor himself. In the life of Zʿura,
                    Pope Agapetus (another inhabitant of the Palace of Placidia) bears the brunt of
                    John’s ill will for his attempted use of force in bringing Zʿura to court.
                    John’s holy man makes clear that the outrage is twofold, seamlessly joining
                    canon and private law. Agapetus’ demand cannot be met during their current
                    observance of a fast, and his forcible removal would involve trespass on private
                    property donated by Theodora.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn53" n="52"><p

                    perpetrators of the persecution and their illicit methods as similar under
                    Justinian and Justin. He stressed in Zʿura’s life, as he would throughout the

                    the behaviour of the Chalcedonians and their lack of respect for due process.
                    However, by keeping the focus on truth in his presentation of legal proceedings,
                    John equally realizes a tension between courts as an accepted instrument for the
                    discovery of the truth and their frequent failure to do so. In contrast to the
                    unfavorable view of Chalcedonian clerics, John’s presentation of the imperial
                    hierarchy is, if not balanced, at least complex.</p>

                    History</hi></head>
                <p xml:lang="en">John presented court cases with dynamism and created a rapidly
                    developing narrative. This narrative licence is one of the primary indications
                    that John’s history is best understood less as a chronicle of events and more as
                    a political <hi rend="italic">apologia</hi>. Below, this will provide the bulk
                    of the material for analysing John’s use of literary structure to defend his
                    church. However, it is thematically situated in an overarching biblical and
                    eschatological structure that frames the court cases.</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">Although, as mentioned above, the very beginning of the Third Part
                    of John’s work is no longer extant, the first few lines of the remaining text
                    set up this biblical framework. The following analysis is an impressionistic
                    rather than exhaustive demonstration of John’s skill as a literary historian in
                    that it makes no claims to exhaust his use of scriptural framing. The beginning
                    of the text, as it remains, is dense with quotations from Matthew’s Gospel,
                    which are deployed non-sequentially and drawn from across the book. Matthew 4
                    moves into Mathew 24 before an extended quotation from Matthew 10, which places
                    the court proceedings documented above explicitly in the Biblical context of
                    persecution: “Beware of people delivering you to the courts and in their
                    synagogues you will be beaten and you will be brought before governors and kings
                    for my sake as a witness for them and the Gentiles.”<note place="foot"

                        10:17–18.</hi></p></note> John is clear that this is precisely what is
                    taking place in his own time by capping the quotation with “We are already
                    seeing these things clearly.” Equally striking is John’s omission of the end of
                    verse 22, “but he that endures to the end shall be saved”, choosing to remove
                    any silver lining from his bleak narrative of earthly persecution.</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">However, John does not settle for this concluding exegesis and
                    omission but is prepared to add to the biblical text. His quotation of Matthew
                    24, which follows Christ’s declaration of the end times and the second coming,
                    matches the Peshitta except for a final added participle (<foreign
                        xml:lang="syr">ܗ̈ܘܝܢ</foreign>) which enlivens the quotations to the present
                    time of writing: “when you see all these things <hi rend="italic">which are

                    uncorroborated and frequently demands a suspension of disbelief, an awareness of
                    John’s historiographical framework allows the text to be approached with
                    specific caution. John not only presented his miaphysite history within the
                    context of biblical persecution but also employed literary manipulation for
                    added immediacy. The cases John presented frequently contribute explicitly to
                    the realization of his biblical eschatology, either by participating
                    typologically in the biblical narrative or serving simply as evidence of the
                    present end times. To appreciate the cumulative impact of John’s structural
                    development, the cases will be handled sequentially, following his order. The

                                    lay officials, and the considerable involvement of John
                                    Scholasticus may be intended to compare unfavorably with the
                                    trial by gathered peers documented at the ecumenical councils.
                                    Artur Steinwenter noted the aspirational correspondence of
                                    ecclesiastical process to the Gospel and Pauline injunctions on

                                    the councils (including Ephesus II) displayed a variety of lay
                                    and ecclesiastic leadership. The emphasis, as will be developed
                                    later, is rather on John Scholasticus’ particular overreach than
                                    an error of form in this respect. The erroneous impression is
                                    certainly given by this list that the miaphysite majority was
                                    under persecution from a tiny number of influential

                    (mis)representation of these elements. John began his own ‘Acts of the Apostles’
                    with his own protomartyr, Stephen the presbyter, whose case provided the initial

                    Stephen declared it by his characterization of the prefect’s actions, “you are
                    judging” (<foreign xml:lang="syr">ܕܐ̇ܢ ܐܢܬ</foreign> ), was derailed and
                    transferred by the prefect to the Chalcedonian bishop. Importantly, when
                    confronted with the proposition that he was, in fact, adjudicating, the prefect
                    washed his hands of the matter (<foreign xml:lang="syr"

                    unwilling to condemn the Severans. It is instead the bishop who quarantines
                    Stephen in Heracleia, denying him access to social interaction with his

                    modelled this double trial before the prefect and priest, including the secular

                    is notably silent on their ecclesiastical authorization to ordain in Asia. One
                    explanation for John’s insistent focus on the canonical legitimacy of his fellow
                    bishops in the <hi rend="italic">Ecclesiastical History</hi> might therefore be
                    an awareness that they were particularly vulnerable to accusations in this area.
                    This might further explain John’s (mis)representation of John Scholasticus’
                    somewhat unbelievably forceful and capricious approach in these trials.</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">The significance of Elisha’s relocation is made amply clear by
                    Justinian’s 5<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> novel, in which it is written that
                    monks who leave their monasteries either for the outside world or another
                    monastery must leave all their property with the monastery: “<hi rend="italic"
                        >substantia maneat et vindicetur a priori monasterio</hi>.”<note

                    not only disrupted miaphysite networks, but also stripped the miaphysite leaders
                    of their means. Conversely, the clerical ridicule Paul received for accepting
                    reordination serves as the <hi rend="italic">vox ecclesiae </hi>protesting
                    uncanonical measures and alerting the reader to unlawful actions. John
                    Scholasticus’ two supposed motives are made explicit in the cases of Elisha and
                    Paul: pecuniary advantage and a sheer desire for outrage.</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">However, Elisha’s punishment is perhaps not as harsh as John makes
                    it seem. Elisha was relocated from Beth Dios (<foreign xml:lang="syr"
                        >ܒܝܬ</foreign><lb/><foreign xml:lang="syr">ܕܝܘܣ</foreign>) to Beth Abraham
                        (<foreign xml:lang="syr">ܒܝܬ ܐܒܪܗܡ</foreign>). Beth Dios was a monastery of
                    the pro-Roman and Chalcedonian Acoemetae. By contrast, it seems that Beth
                    Abraham was possibly founded on premises gifted to John of Ephesus by the
                    chamberlain Callinicus.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn63" n="62"><p

                    miaphysite containment rather than isolation. This calls into question John’s
                    earlier claim that the bishops were dwelling peacefully in their monasteries and
                    instead suggests, as in the case of Stephen, that militant miaphysism was being
                    addressed and contained by the Chalcedonians. Indeed, although an illness
                    accompanies the relocation, this is not described as the intended consequence,
                    something John is quite happy to heavily imply in Stephen’s case. The distinct
                    methods and implications of the persecutions are already apparent. While the
                    first case of Stephen the presbyter provides a grassroots denunciation working
                    its way toward the ecclesiastical hierarchy, the second cases show the
                    far-reaching influence of the Constantinopolitan patriarch in enforcing his
                    orthodoxy. John thus provides a Caiaphas and a mob to condemn the Christlike
                    miaphysite clergy. As noted above, the similarity is certainly intentional. Even
                    in the similar punishments inflicted, the differentiation of the harsh treatment
                    rendered to presbyters and bishops is striking; the conflict over Stephen the
                    presbyter’s corpse contrasts somewhat sharply with Elisha’s enforced retirement.
                    Nevertheless, John’s structure has highlighted two propositions to which these
                    initial examples should lead us. Firstly, he stresses the possibility of the
                    misuse of judicial mechanisms, and secondly, he proposes John Scholasticus’
                    predisposition to engage in such conduct.</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">The extraordinary presence of the emperor encourages an
                    extraordinary narrative and outcome in John’s third case. The treatment of
                    Stephan, bishop of Cyprus, dismisses any idea of episcopal deference. John again
                    invokes <hi rend="italic">Acts</hi> when he describes Stephan’s Pauline recovery
                    after the violence of the <hi rend="italic">excubitores</hi> (<foreign

                    Plataea, where Stephan had been banished, to compel him through violence to
                    enter communion with the patriarch. Stephan’s speeches to the patriarch and the
                    emperor in Constantinople concerning proposed reordinations reveal specific
                    concerns. While his speech to the patriarch focuses on the theological
                    inconsistency of reperforming sacramental baptism and ordination, his speech to
                    the emperor relies on persuasion by canonical inaccuracy:</p>

                    the canons. Similarly, upon Theodosius of Alexandria’s death in 566, and the
                    subsequent election of both a Chalcedonian and miaphysite successor, John did
                    not give the emperor a partisan view on his successor, but rather affirmed the
                    emperor’s desire for unity and canonicity in the selection of one bishop: “It

                    We are therefore told that Stephan received a favourable ruling within a context
                    of <hi rend="italic">persecutio renovata</hi> by appealing to the canonicity of
                    his holy orders. In his account, John has, for the time being, obscured the
                    Christological controversy in favour of more technical questions. By temporarily
                    dividing theological and legal orthodoxy, John enabled a miaphysite victory in
                    an imperial context. This encourages a more nuanced approach to miaphysism as a
                    legally defined heresy in Justin’s empire. If, as this example demonstrates,
                    matters of ecclesiastical organization within canon law could be settled in
                    favour of a miaphysite and against the patriarch of Constantinople, ‘the
                    orthodox’ were defined as much in legal rulings on the canonicity of practical
                    questions of authority and competencies as they were by doctrinal statements.
                    Stephan had submitted to communion with the “Synodites” before this success.
                    Nevertheless, his ordination, the matter at stake in the debate, was certainly

                    reticence to engage in expensive court proceedings. More persuasively perhaps

                    portrayed as both very serious and obvious. This contrasts greatly with what

                    to which they led. It also seems prudent to lay out in more detail the normal
                    legal options open to a plaintiff in the 6<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>
                    century. After this, we will have the best viewpoint from which to see how John
                    of Ephesus created his crescendo of flawed forensics. It is worth mentioning
                    from the outset that the legal methods which will be discussed are those proper
                    to ‘secular’ law rather than ecclesiastical law. It may therefore seem that
                    their use here is not appropriate to the nature of the dispute, namely a matter
                    of church order between the emperor, the patriarch of Constantinople, and a
                    group of bishops rather than a single defendant. Nevertheless, the conclusion of
                    the episode in a trial before the senate and a magistrate encourages us to blur
                    the lines. Furthermore, these will be used as types not of the precise methods
                    of restitution, but rather of the various processes which were certainly
                    recognisable to citizens. As Steinwenter noted, there is no reason to doubt

                    miaphysite bishops whom he had imprisoned in Constantinople, including John of
                    Ephesus, took the form of a letter in which the patriarch demanded that the
                    miaphysite bishops unite themselves to the Chalcedonian church. The patriarch
                    specified that this union should be like “the unity between Cyril of Alexandria
                    and John of Antioch”.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn75" n="74"><p

                    (probably abbreviated) contents of this letter, as John presented them,
                    correspond in no way to the requirements of a formal summons. This prepares the
                    reader for two possibilities. If legal proceedings follow, then we are already
                    aware of the patriarch’s irregular process. Alternatively, if legal proceedings
                    do not follow, then the patriarch’s letter signalled that dialogue and mediation
                    were still the appropriate response. The actions of the miaphysite bishops makes
                    more sense in this latter context. They responded with an argument that was
                    logical rather than theological, except as a general refutation of the council
                    of Chalcedon in an (at this point) unspecified way. Their strategy was to point
                    out the inconsistency of them behaving like Cyril in only the manner of his
                    communion with John of Antioch. They argued that real emulation would require
                    them to view the council of Chalcedon as Cyril had viewed Nestorius: “and we
                    will anathematize and repudiate and throw out the synod of Chalcedon from the
                    Church of God, just as Cyril did to that lawless Nestorius” (<foreign

                    initial posture John has the bishops adopt is combative. His presentation
                    undermines Chalcedon by framing their first engagement not as an act of
                    enforcement by John Scholasticus, but as a continuation of an unsettled
                    dispute.</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">John’s control of the narrative develops in the following chapter.
                    The bishops’ argument moved from the logically formal to the legalistically
                    formal. The miaphysites challenged John Scholasticus to provide canonical
                    support for his alleged practice of re-ordination. Knowing that this was not
                    canonical, it is fair to say that this record represents John picking battles he
                    knew he could win. It seems designed to move the debate from church unity or the
                    authority of the council or patriarch, towards specific violations of church
                    order. The initiative taken by the miaphysites in this rejoinder is surely an
                    authorial decision. It seems very unlikely in the first place that the bishops
                    would have been brought to dispute with John Scholasticus. For the patriarch,
                    these miaphysite bishops were an issue of church government, not doctrine. It is
                    impossible to imagine that John was repeating the patriarch’s own words when he

                    both parties. Importantly, the Roman arbitrator did not act as a judge, nor were

                    presented this as part of an ongoing discussion and negotiation.</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">This point is highly significant. Following the counterproposals of
                    the Chalcedonian faction, John and his fellow miaphysite bishops were unwilling
                    to agree to the edict.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn81" n="80"><p

                    was keen to show that he and the other bishops had not walked away from the

                            good faith, were abused by the patriarch).</p></note> Again, this makes
                    sense if the episode is understood as an exercise in imperial arbitration. A
                    willingness to remain in negotiations with ‘Synodites’ is not obviously
                    desirable for John’s relationship with his audience unless there was something
                    to be gained from the discussions.</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">Nevertheless, the bishops’ failure to agree to the edict left them
                    open to charges by John Scholasticus that they were the obstacle to unity. This

                    process was in turn the main reason for the eventual acquiescence of the
                    miaphysite bishops to communicating with the patriarch. Overall, we can
                    characterize the first part of John’s own trial, up to the point of his
                    communicating with John Scholasticus, in two legal frameworks. The first is a
                    process of negotiation, or arbitration initiated by Justin. Insofar as both
                    sides agreed to the emperor’s arbitration of the dispute, they were bound to
                    accept what he decided. The second intrudes irregularly onto the narrative, in
                    that, rather than following through with the working out the arbitration, the
                    process was transferred into the court (<foreign xml:lang="gr"

                <p xml:lang="en">The second part of John’s trial saw an unexpected return from the
                    patriarch’s court to the former, extra-curial process highlighted above. A
                    personal letter from the emperor to the miaphysite bishops in captivity aimed at
                    reconciling the mutual excommunications created another situation like the Roman
                    process of mediation. John reported that the emperor wrote that “We think in God
                    we are doing that which should content you, and putting you in perfect unity”
                        (<foreign xml:lang="syr">ܡܣ̇ܒܪܝܢܢ ܓܝܪ</foreign><lb/><foreign xml:lang="syr"

                    Nevertheless, more than in the first instance, the tone of the letter suggests
                    that Justin imagined his input would have been, or at least should have been,
                    decisive in mending the schism. However, the planned mediation was prevented by
                    the imperial couple’s month-long retirement to the baths, after which the
                    Patriarch John “led the counsellors and went out to meet him” (<foreign
                        xml:lang="syr">ܕܒܪ ܒܢ̈ܝ ܡܠܟ̣ܗ̣ ܘܢܦܩ ܠܘܬܗ</foreign>).<note place="foot"

                    The mediation was therefore flawed due to the unequal access of the two parties
                    to the mediator. John also suggested that a lack of political will could be
                    blamed for giving the Chalcedonian party free rein over the situation, and an
                    unequal footing in the proceedings. However, the unexpected return to this more
                    casual, or at least open-ended discussion between the emperor and the parties
                    might be a literary creation, intended to make the issue seem rather less
                    closed. John himself wrote that some may think his account far-fetched.<note

                    written in Greek, the similarity between Justin’s desire for unity (<foreign

                <p xml:lang="en">Beyond John’s clear intention in providing the emperor Justin with
                    a less than pressing prior arrangement at the baths, contrasting sharply with
                    the plight of the imprisoned bishops, the significance of John’s presentation of
                    events is twofold. The emperor undermined the process of mediation by proceeding
                    to act immediately on the advice of only one of the parties which had the
                    freedom to approach him, and more strikingly, his role in the proceedings
                    shifted quickly to the distinct position of adjudicator. Justin’s next step in
                    summoning the two parties before the senate and a magistrate (the quaestor) as
                        <hi rend="italic">iudices, </hi>(<foreign xml:lang="syr">ܣ̣ܘܢܩܠܝܛܘܣ ܥܡ
                        ܩ̣ܐܣܛܘܪ</foreign>) marks the beginning of formal litigation after
                    ineffectual and half-hearted attempts at an extra-curial solution.<note

                    It is also importantly distinct from John Scholasticus’ ecclesiastical court.
                    Whereas this second mediation or possible imperial arbitration was a bargaining
                    process, seeking a compromise between the two parties, adjudication and the
                    subsequent <hi rend="italic">iudicium</hi> decided unreservedly for either
                    party. John’s inclusion of the earlier deceit of the Chalcedonians in enticing
                    the miaphysite bishops to communion aims to demonstrate why prima facie the move
                    to the public proceedings of the adjudication was preferable. Under the formal
                        <hi rend="italic">litis contestatio</hi>, the process would be public and
                    open to scrutiny. The underhanded machinations attributed to the Chalcedonians
                    by John would not be possible in such circumstances. We have been led to expect
                    by John’s focus on canonicity that, if properly conducted, formal and thorough
                    legal proceedings would favour the miaphysites. </p>
                <p xml:lang="en">Given however that in the present case the senate decided
                    wholeheartedly against the miaphysites, John sought to undermine this public and
                    binding <hi rend="italic">iudicium</hi> by recording irregularities in the
                    process. Not only does John present the legal status of the case in rapid flux
                    from the earlier arbitration and mediation to adjudication, but the order of the
                    trial itself is challenged. Firstly, there is no anticipation of an opportunity
                    for dispute “since they were besought [to comply] as if by command” (<foreign
                        xml:lang="syr">ܟܕ ܡܬ̇ܬܒܥܝܢ ܐܝܟ ܕܡܢ ܦܘܩܕܢܐ</foreign>). The result of the
                    trial is the first business announced. This contrasts starkly with Eusebius of
                    Dorylaeum’s formal indictment of Eutyches before Flavian in 448 which begins
                    with a clear charge: “Not long ago, I came to your Holiness and brought charges
                    accusing Eutyches, that he, as presbyter and archimandrite of this city, was
                    ruining the doctrines of the orthodox church, as much by way of informal
                    conversations as in his formal catechesis of those who came to him.”<note

                    judicial irregularity. The confused legal process and the following show trial
                    create overwhelming sympathy for the miaphysite position. However, this incident
                    equally forms part of John’s presentation of eschatology, for the author himself
                    has been brought before “governors and kings for my sake”.<note place="foot"

                <p xml:lang="en">The rest of John’s extant history moves away from the specifically
                    forensic scenes treated above. It is reasonable to suppose that this change of
                    focus is a deliberate choice as John moves from a Roman and ecclesiastical
                    context, to first the treatment of lay miaphysites, and then persecution outside
                    the empire under the Sassanians. With the guise of legality cast off, future
                    clerical persecutions would make no claims to any kind of legal process. The
                    cupidity and overreach of John Scholasticus still loom large in the narrative,
                    but the persecution of the priests Andrew and two Sergii was mob action
                    undertaken through treachery and violence “in the likeness of Judas” (<foreign

                    spoiled, and finally delivered up even to death; ‘lo!’ said they, ‘in all the

                    us also to do the same in all our dominions, and convert to our own religion all

                <head>Conclusion</head>
                <p xml:lang="en">John’s carefully structured
                    presentation of trials, law, and lawlessness in the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Ecclesiastical History</hi> serves principally to undermine the practice of
                    these once sure determiners of orthodoxy and justify the miaphysite position
                    outside the legal orthodoxy of the Chalcedonian Church. He employs a Biblical
                    eschatological decline narrative as special pleading for a group which found
                    itself on the wrong side of the institutions which had come to hold central
                    importance in defining orthodoxy. By his
                    presentation of events in order of their legal irregularity rather than strict
                    chronology, John causes his reader to focus on the institutional errors of the
                    Chalcedonian church. He thereby systematically undermined the intention, the
                    process, and the outcome of the legal proceedings against the miaphysites to
                    exculpate himself and his co-confessionalists. The glimmer of hope and imperial
                    indulgence of the earliest trials demonstrate John’s belief that forensic
                    orthodoxy, if undertaken correctly and pervaded with truth, could deliver for
                    the miaphysites. In all the above cases, there is a marked absence of
                    supernatural assistance for the miaphysites. The stress on the institutional
                    validity of <hi rend="italic">his</hi> miaphysite position (if only by contrast
                    with the lawlessness of the Chalcedonians) serves to make the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Ecclesiastical History</hi> a companion volume to the charismatic authority
                    of holy men in his <hi rend="italic">Lives of the Eastern Saints</hi>. In order
                    to demonstrate this institutional authority, John of Ephesus was compelled to
                    demonstrate fraud, lawlessness, and wilfulness in the process of the
                    Chalcedonians. In the legal-ecclesiastical environment of the 6<hi
                        rend="superscript">th</hi> century, a demonstration of flawed forensics was
                    the most viable challenge to John Scholasticus and Eutychius in their imperially
                    sanctioned enforcement of union.</p>

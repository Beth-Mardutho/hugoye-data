    Zammit’s chrestomathy aims not only to deepen the
    linguistic competence of those “students who have covered
    the essentials of Syriac morphology and syntax,” but also
    to expose them to some of the “varied range” of
    Syriac prose and poetry (viii). In one hundred pages of
    annotated readings employing all three scripts, the reader is
    taken chronologically through extracts from twenty-six sources
    that span the third to the thirteenth centuries (3–103).
    The texts appear in the script in which they were originally
    published, and preserve the original editors punctuation, and
    vocalization when present. The annotations do not presume
    familiarity with any particular Syriac grammar, but are
    entirely self contained. Following the texts is a complete
    Syriac-English glossary (105–51). The last quarter of the
    volume is taken up by an English-Syriac glossary, which is
    something of an unexpected bonus (153–97). A useful Index
    of Grammatical Points follows (198–201), and the volume
    concludes with a Bibliography. A Preface by Sebastian Brock
    contains details of a number of other useful chrestomathies,
    most of which are now out of print.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P2"/>[2] The
    <hi rend="italic">Book of Crumbs</hi> was originally published under the
    title <hi rend="italic">Kthabuna d-parthuthe</hi> (<hi rend="italic">The Little Book of
    Scraps</hi>) by the Archbishop of Canterbury’s mission to
    Urmia in 1898. The volume contains a substantial anthology
    (more than 370 pages) of Syriac literature presented in a
    vocalized East Syriac script, drawing on texts from the fourth
    to the sixteenth centuries. The table of contents gives a rough
    guide to what is included in the volume, and the indices that
    conclude the work will help the user ascertain more precisely
    what texts and authors are represented. The printed text is
    almost uniformly clear, and even the introductions and notes,
    which are in a much smaller font, are quite legible. The volume
    is comprised of texts in a variety of genres, written in both
    verse and prose, and includes representatives from both the
    East and West Syrian traditions. Thus Jacob of Edessa sits
    alongside Babai the Great, and Bar Hebraeus alongside Giwargis
    Warda. The volume is especially good in its coverage of
    extracts from later authors.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P3"/>[3] In
    reviewing volumes such as these, one cannot help noting ways
    that things could have been done differently. Perhaps Zammit
    would have been advised to include references to
    Nöldeke’s <hi rend="italic">Compendious Syriac Grammar</hi>, or to
    the standard teaching grammars, in his grammatical explanations
    for example. Similarly, it would seem that both volumes could
    benefit from some bibliographical notes to indicate where a
    reader may go to read more by, or about, a particular author
    that has piqued their interest. Perhaps a simple reference to
    Brock’s very useful bibliography in Muraoka’s
    grammar (2005) would suffice on this account (<hi rend="italic">Classical
    Syriac</hi>, 127-56). However, such observations should not
    distract from the value of the volumes under consideration.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P4"/>[4] What
    both of these volumes have in common is their aim to introduce
    the reader to the breadth of the Syriac literary tradition.
    This is a valuable objective, especially since it is still very
    much the case that the majority of students learning Syriac are
    doing so in order to work with a very small part of the
    literature. It can only be hoped that such focused learners of
    Syriac will take the time to read through one of these volumes,
    or indeed any of the numerous other anthologies and
    Chrestomathies that have been published over the last two
    centuries, and in doing so will be convinced that there is more
    to be sought and found in this literature than they first
    supposed.</p>

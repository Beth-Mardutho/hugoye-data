                <p xml:lang="en">In her revised dissertation <hi rend="italic">Missionary Stories
                        and the Formation of the Syriac Churches</hi>, Jeanne-Nicole Mellon
                    Saint-Laurent focuses on a corpus of missionary stories written in Syriac: the
                        <hi rend="italic">Acts of Thomas</hi> (3rd c.), the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Teaching of Addai</hi> (ca. 400), the <hi rend="italic">Acts of Mari</hi>
                    (late 6th c.), the <hi rend="italic">Lives of Simeon of Beth Arsham</hi> and <hi
                        rend="italic">Jacob Baradaeus</hi> by John of Ephesos (mid-6th c.), the
                    longer <hi rend="italic">Life of Jacob Baradaeus</hi> (late 7th c.), and finally
                    the <hi rend="italic">Life of Ahudemmeh</hi> (7th / 8th c.). Her analysis of
                    these texts examines the “relevance of the missionary story in the
                    self-presentation of Syriac sacred history” (p. 4). As the title suggests, all
                    of the stories in the corpus were written in Syriac. Additionally, they are
                    mainly from the pre-Islamic period and originate from a Syriac Orthodox
                    background (with the exception of the <hi rend="italic">Acts of Mari</hi>). As
                    the introduction makes quite clear, the main focus is indeed on the
                    anti-Chalcedonian Syriac Orthodox Church, especially on the interaction of the
                    saints with the Persian aristocracy. Throughout the work, Saint-Laurent seeks
                    out the “symbolic layers of hagiographic and biblical types” as well as the
                    recurring motifs in this corpus. Her analysis aims to uncover the “ideals these
                    symbols promote” (p. 4). She analyzes the intertexuality of the missionary
                    stories, not claiming a literary dependency of the sources, but rather that
                    their authors drew on a common religious memory. Her analysis reveals a common
                    basis for Syriac missionary stories and biblical motifs, shared by the texts
                    that create stories that resonate with each other on several levels (p.134-135).
                    She is especially interested in the way they are used to form identities or
                    construe the otherness of the religious rival. She approaches this task through
                    a thorough discussion of seven Syriac apocryphal and hagiographic accounts.</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">The work begins with two apocryphal accounts, the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Acts of Thomas</hi> (3rd century) and the <hi rend="italic">Teaching of
                        Addai</hi> (ca. 400), both produced before the schism of the 5th / 6th
                    centuries. Saint-Laurent is right to put the <hi rend="italic">Acts of
                        Thomas</hi> at the beginning of her discussion. This text – originally
                    written in Syriac – originates very likely in Edessa and thus in the center of
                    Syriac Christianity. It is itself deeply influenced by other texts, especially
                    the Bible and other apocryphal Acts, and it is the most important source for
                    literary motifs in the Syriac missionary stories. The basic structure is simple,
                    as Saint-Laurent notes on p. 30: “...the itinerant holy man brings his portable
                    practices to convert rulers and sanctifies the wilderness for the worship of his
                    Christianity, uprooting, when necessary, the remnants of the religious ‘others’,
                    whether ‘pagan’ or Christian ‘heretic.’” Several of these motifs Saint-Laurent
                    detects in her corpus. Already in the <hi rend="italic">Teaching of Addai</hi>
                    (ca. 400), the famous story of the epistolary correspondence between King Abgar
                    and Jesus Christ and the deeds of his disciple Addai in Edessa, we can find
                    motifs already present in the <hi rend="italic">Acts of Thomas</hi>, in which a
                    poor apostle converts a king by means of healing. The <hi rend="italic"
                        >Teaching</hi> brings together “a Christian apostle (Addai), a Christian
                    king (Abgar) and a Christian city (Edessa)”. But these motifs are used
                    differently than in the <hi rend="italic">Acts of Thomas</hi>. Addai does not
                    encounter great opposition, but the king is on his side from the beginning.
                    Further, Addai is not itinerant; he stays at Edessa until his death; and he does
                    not become a martyr, although his disciple Aggai does. In this way, the <hi
                        rend="italic">Teaching of Addai</hi> already exhibits the transformation of
                    traditional motifs.</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">After the discussion of these earlier texts from the Syriac
                    tradition, Saint-Laurent turns to texts from the time in which the Syriac
                    Orthodox Church formed. The <hi rend="italic">Acts of Mari</hi>, I would argue,
                    also belong to this set of texts although they originated in the Church of the
                    East. The composition of this work in the 6th century falls within the time of
                    theological conflict between the official Church of the East and those who
                    sympathized with and later joined the Miaphysite movement. Here motifs already
                    seen in earlier texts appear in that Mari is an itinerant missionary moving from
                    place to place to proselytize; he aims for the center of power to convert the
                    Persian king; and like Thomas he persuades by healing. On the other hand, the
                    story also exhibits strong affinities with the <hi rend="italic">Teaching of
                        Addai</hi>: Mari is ordained and assigned to the mission to the Persian
                    Empire by Addai in Edessa just before his peaceful death.</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">After her analysis of the <hi rend="italic">Acts of Mari</hi>,
                    Saint-Laurent turns to the Syriac Orthodox Church by analyzing two hagiographic
                    accounts of John of Ephesus, who wrote in 6th-century Constantinople in the
                    midst of the christological conflict between Miaphysites and Chalcedonians. She
                    first inserts a short chapter on John of Ephesus to explore the background and
                    self-representation of this important Syriac Orthodox author. John wrote at a
                    time when the conflict between the Miaphysites and Chalcedonians was still
                    undecided. In the political situation of John’s time, it still seemed possible
                    that the Roman Empire could endorse Miaphysite doctrine or find a christological
                    compromise. In his literary production, John tried therefore to navigate a
                    difficult middle path between condemning the official position of the emperor
                    and attempting to find a compromise. Understanding this twofold position of the
                    Miaphysite movement in general in the 6th century is important for the analysis
                    of his hagiographic accounts, represented by the <hi rend="italic">Life of
                        Simeon of Beth Arsham</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Life of Jacob
                        Baradaeus</hi> in Saint-Laurent’s book. Simeon as well as Jacob are depicted
                    as itinerant, ascetic, and poor bishops. In the <hi rend="italic">Life of
                        Simeon</hi>, the focus is on his multilingualism and eloquence. Therefore,
                    the debate between Simeon and Babowai, the catholicos of the Church of the East,
                    is of special interest. Christology is discussed and – of course – Simeon’s
                    argumentation proves more convincing. In the same text, Simeon asks Emperor
                    Anastasius for help to ease the burden of the Miaphysite Christians in the
                    Persian Empire. Anastasius sends him to the Shah in order to discuss the case.
                    The focus in the <hi rend="italic">Life of Jacob</hi>, on the other hand, is on
                    his arduous effort to build a Miaphysite hierarchy by which he prevents the
                    Syriac Orthodox Church from vanishing. John of Ephesus depicts both bishops as
                    two of many excellent champions of the anti-Chalcedonian cause and he does not
                    divinize them. This is different in the <hi rend="italic">Longer Life of Jacob
                        Baradaeus</hi> written either in the 7th or in the 8th century. This <hi
                        rend="italic">vita</hi> depicts Jacob as superhuman from his miraculous
                    birth onwards. He becomes the founder and the savior of his church and, as a
                    consequence, the <hi rend="italic">Longer Life of Jacob</hi> adopts the
                    designation “Jacobite” for this church that by the 7th and 8th centuries was
                    clearly distinguishable from the official Chalcedonian church of the Roman
                    Empire.</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">The last hagiographic text Saint-Laurent analyzes is the <hi
                        rend="italic">Life of Ahudemmeh</hi>. As opposed to the aforementioned
                    Syriac Orthodox hagiographic accounts, this text seems to be written within the
                    Persian Empire in the 7th century. Saint-Laurent identifies many allusions to
                    missionary stories like the <hi rend="italic">Acts of Thomas</hi> or <hi
                        rend="italic">Mari</hi>. For example, the hagiographer tells of the
                    conversion of the Shah’s son. The text thus draws on the motif of the conversion
                    of the monarch, but its focus on the son sets it apart from earlier accounts. At
                    the same time, this episode marks the beginning of the saint’s martyrdom; and
                    his imprisonment and death allude to the East Syriac martyr tradition as well as
                    to the <hi rend="italic">Acts of Thomas</hi>.</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">Saint-Laurent shows that the similarities between these <hi
                        rend="italic">Acts</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Lives</hi> justify speaking of
                    a common Syriac missionary rhetoric, built on a common narrative typology, that
                    forms the basis of an “idealized Christian society” (p. 129). These accounts aim
                    to emphasize the orthodoxy and apostolicity of the communities from which they
                    emerged and to which they were addressed. They create cohesion within their own
                    group by sanctifying their mission and demonizing the religious other. While the
                    principal motifs remain consistent, they prove very pliable, providing the
                    hagiographers with various possibilities for using them.</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">Here I want to raise two small points about this wonderful book.
                    First, each chapter in this work offers an introduction to and thorough analysis
                    of an apocryphal or hagiographic account. This enables readers to study each
                    chapter on its own. But at the same time this leads to some redundancies that
                    can make it difficult to find the narrative thread in the book. Second, although
                    the focus on the Syriac Orthodox Church can be justified methodologically, the
                    title speaks of the “Syriac Churches”. It is true that the third chapter
                    discusses a text from the Church of the East, but it is one that mainly reacts
                    to the diffusion of Miaphysite christology in the Persian Empire. It would have
                    been enlightening to include further texts from the Church of the East,
                    including, for example, the <hi rend="italic">Life of Rabban Hormizd.</hi>
                    Although this is not a missionary text in the strict sense, it shares some of
                    the motifs Saint-Laurent explores. Furthermore, the Chalcedonian Church in Syria
                    and the Levant has a rich Syriac heritage too and can thus be classified as a
                    Syriac Church. This is not discussed at all.</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">Nonetheless, the very fine and thorough analyses of the individual
                    sources and their comparison offer a new perspective on the gradual development
                    of the Syriac Orthodox Church into an autonomous church situated between the
                    imperial church and the Church of the East. Saint-Laurent convincingly shows how
                    the missionary stories play an important role for the gradual formation of this
                    church, beginning with the first Syriac missionary texts from Edessa written to
                    prove its apostolic origin, to John of Ephesus, writing at the time of the
                    christological controversies to maintain his version of orthodoxy, to the first
                    hagiographic accounts that reflect the emergence of a distinct church. The

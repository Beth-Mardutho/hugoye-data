         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P1"/>[1] On
    November 24, 2001, the Canadian Society for Syriac Studies held
    its first symposium.  The conference was organized by the
    president of the Society, Dr. Amir Harrak, professor of Aramaic
    and Syriac at the University of Toronto, and partially financed
    by a grant from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research
    Council of Canada.  The symposium was chaired by Dr. Grant
    Frame, Associate Professor of Akkadian Language at the
    University of Toronto and Assistant Director/Editor of the
    Royal Inscriptions of Mesopotamia project.  The program of
    the day-long conference ranged from an examination of the
    spread of Christianity in Syria and Mesopotamia to a review of
    modern scholarship on the subject of Syriac Christianity,
    demonstrating the scope of scholarship in this field.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P2"/>[2] After a
    word of greeting from the Chair of the Department of Near and
    Middle Eastern Civilizations at the University of Toronto,
    Professor James Reilly, the symposium began with a paper by the
    host, Professor Amir Harrak.  His lecture, entitled
    “Trade Routes and the Christianization of the Near
    East” began with two of the most important Syriac
    sources, the <hi rend="italic">Teaching of Addai</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Acts of
    Mari</hi>.  These two documents suggest that the spread of
    Christianity in the Near East was due primarily to a programmed
    apostolic mission.  Prof. Harrak presented an alternative
    analysis of these texts, proposing that Christianity was
    transmitted throughout Syria and Mesopotamia along trade routes
    and with the help of merchants.  Other religions and
    sects, including Judaism, Manichaeism, Buddhism, and Islam,
    spread in this same manner, thus it is not difficult to imagine
    Syriac Christianity following the same pattern.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P3"/>[3] The
    second paper of the day, presented by Professor Paul-Hubert
    Poirier of the Université de Laval, was entitled
    “Faith and Persuasion: On Bardaisan of Edessa’s
    Epistemology.”  Prof. Poirier presented the Syriac
    <hi rend="italic">Book of the Laws of Countries</hi>, a dialogue between
    Bardaisan and Awida, and then focused his attention on the main
    theme of the text, that it is impossible to arrive at a firm
    conviction without faith.  He reconstructed the
    philosophical background of this belief, and concluded by
    situating it within a broader scope, that of the Coptic Gnostic
    treatise <hi rend="italic">The Interpretation of Knowledge</hi> and
    Augustine’s aphorism “Crede ut
    intellegas.”</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P4"/>[4] Dr.
    Robert A. Kitchen offered the third lecture of the symposium
    entitled “Becoming Perfect: The Maturing of Asceticism in
    the Syriac Book of Steps.”  The speaker presented
    the mid-fourth century document, which is a collection of
    thirty discourses on the spiritual life by an anonymous author,
    and then proceeded to decipher it by focusing on the variety of
    literary genres employed and what function these different
    forms play in the development of an ascetic community. 
    The Syriac Book of Steps is an exceptional work because it
    provides a seemingly accurate picture of asceticism, with all
    its inadequacies and accomplishments.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P5"/>[5] The
    fourth speaker of the day was Professor Sydney H. Griffith of
    the Catholic University of America in Washington, DC.  He
    delivered a paper entitled “Christianity in Edessa and
    the Syriac-Speaking World: A Review of Past Scholarship and a
    Proposal for the Future.”  Prof. Griffith presented
    an overview of the scholarship surrounding the question of the
    beginning of Christianity in the Syriac-speaking world, on the
    frontier of the Roman and Persian Empires in Late
    Antiquity.  A new paradigm for the assessment of the role
    of the various sects in the Syriac Christian communities was
    proposed, with a particular focus on the works of Ephrem the
    Syrian.  He then used this paradigm to help interpret
    early Christian history in the Syriac-speaking world.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P6"/>[6] After
    this fourth scholarly lecture, the audience was treated to a
    performance by the Choir of the Assyrian Church of the East,
    Toronto Parish.  The choir sang a Syriac poem by Saint
    Ephrem the Syrian entitled <hi rend="italic">In Praise of Learning</hi>. 
    This recital provided the spectators with a tangible portrayal
    of the Syriac Church and its rituals.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P7"/>[7] The
    fifth paper of the symposium was presented by Ms. Marica
    Cassis, a graduate student in the Department of Near and Middle
    Eastern Civilizations at the University of Toronto.  Her
    paper, entitled “The Archaeology of Christian Kokhe: A
    Comparative Study,” examined Christian remains from this
    very important site in southern Iraq.  Kokhe embodies the
    permanent presence of the early Christian church in the
    Sassanian world.  The speaker surveyed the archaeological
    material from the nearby site of Seleucia-Ctesiphon, with a
    special focus on the Christian remains, and then compared these
    findings to the existing information on ancient Kokhe in order
    to develop a better understanding of the Eastern Church in the
    3<hi rend="sup">rd</hi> century.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P8"/>[8] The
    symposium concluded with a presentation by Dr. George A. Kiraz
    of the Syriac Computing Institute and Beth Mardutho: The Syriac
    Institute.  Dr. Kiraz introduced a new project that he has
    been involved with, The Syriac Digital Library.  This
    project endeavors to make a large body of material available on
    the Internet in an eLibrary.  Various kinds of material
    will be digitized, including Bible editions, liturgies,
    grammars, dictionaries, patristic writings, journals and
    magazines, historical works, and much more.  Pictures and
    maps will also be incorporated into the eLibrary, and a
    database will be established to allow searching these
    documents.  The Syriac Digital Library has partnered with
    Brigham Young University, Brown University, Princeton
    Theological Institute, The Catholic University of America, and
    several other libraries, providing access to an extraordinary
    amount of material to enrich the collection.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P9"/>[9] This
    symposium represents the first event of this type for the
    Canadian Society for Syriac Studies.  It was without a
    doubt a resounding success.  This conference provided a
    wide array of papers, covering a range of topics.  One can
    only hope that this was the beginning of a long tradition of
    scholarly symposia for the Society.</p>

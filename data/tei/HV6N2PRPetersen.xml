         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P1"/>[1] Because
    of its antiquity (it was composed about 172 C.E.), Tatian's
    gospel harmony, the Diatessaron, has been the subject of
    intensive study since the Enlightenment. However, since we
    possess no direct descendents of the autograph Diatessaron,
    scholarship has been forced to attempt to reconstruct its text
    from the occasional conjunction of a miscellany of secondary
    and tertiary sources commonly called "witnesses" to the text of
    the Diatessaron. These are usually divided into Eastern and
    Western witnesses. Among the Eastern witnesses are: a
    commentary Ephrem Syrus composed on the Diatessaron; the gospel
    quotations in various early Eastern Fathers and works (such as
    Aphrahat, or the <hi rend="italic">Liber Graduum</hi>); the Syriac versions of
    the NT (the Vetus Syra [Syr<hi rend="sup">s</hi> and Syr<hi rend="sup">c</hi>],
    the Peshitta [Syr<hi rend="sup">p</hi>], and the Palestinian Syriac
    Lectionary [Syr<hi rend="sup">pal</hi> (sometimes referenced in older
    works as Syr<hi rend="sup">j</hi>)]); an Arabic Harmony, translated from
    a Syriac <hi rend="italic">Vorlage</hi> about 1025 CE; and a Persian Harmony,
    apparently translated from a Syriac predecessor no later than
    the thirteenth century (the sequence of harmonization in this
    Persian Harmony shows that it is a new creation; nevertheless,
    because its variant readings sometimes agree with Diatessaronic
    readings, there appears to be some indirect link with the
    Diatessaron). The Western witnesses include: several Latin
    harmonies, the oldest of which is Codex Fuldensis (sixth
    cent.); a bilingual MS in Old High German and Latin, Codex
    Sangallensis (ninth cent.); a group of Middle Dutch Harmonies
    (thirteenth cent. and later); a few Middle High German
    Harmonies (which derive from the Middle Dutch); and two
    families of Early Italian Harmonies (one in the Tuscan and one
    in the Venetian dialects).</p>
         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P2"/>[2] Although
    the Diatessaron has usually been associated with New Testament
    studies, it has long been realized that it is also of potential
    relevance to studies of the Hebrew Bible (the Christian Old
    Testament [OT])—for the gospels contain a considerable number
    of quotations from the OT. Furthermore, since a strong case can
    be made that the Diatessaron was the first gospel text in
    Syriac, the form of the OT citations in the Diatessaron—if they
    could be reconstructed with any degree of reliability—may be of
    value for investigating the history of the OT in Syriac.</p>
         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P3"/>[3] Using
    these well-known observations as his point of departure, the
    author of this monograph, Robert Shedinger, endeavors to
    demonstrate three things. First, he seeks to show that the
    Syriac gospel tradition, especially as manifest in its
    (putative) oldest form—namely, Tatian's Diatessaron—contains
    "readings that are earlier than, and probably more original
    than, what can be recovered from the Greek text tradition
    alone" (p. 2). Second, acknowledging that there are divergences
    between the text of the Diatessaron and the "canonical Greek
    Gospels," Shedinger's study "will demonstrate that many of
    these divergences are not the result of Tatian's editorial
    work, but that Tatian generally took over the Old Testament
    citations in the form he found them in his sources" (p. 2).
    Third, Shedinger will attempt to demonstrate that the OT
    citations in the Diatessaron have not been influenced by the
    text of the Peshitta OT (pp. 8-11; the reverse has been argued
    by Prof. Jan Joosten, of Strasbourg ["The Old Testament
    Quotations in the Old Syriac and the Peshitta Gospels: A
    Contribution to the Study of the Diatessaron," <hi rend="italic">Textus</hi> 15
    (1990), 55-76]; your reviewer endorses neither
    position).<lb/>
         </p>
         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P4"/>[4] This is
    a very tall order. Anyone familiar with such research will
    immediately recognize that the waters are not only murky, but
    filled with hidden cross-currents: the differing readings among
    the gospels themselves, the differing readings of the Hebrew
    Bible and the Septuagint, the "interference" of the other
    versions of the Old Testament (Qumran, the "Old Greek," Aquila,
    etc.), the vagaries of translation, grammar and syntax across
    at least three languages (Hebrew, Greek, Syriac), the same
    vagaries across the multiple languages of the Diatessaronic
    witnesses themselves, and the versional history and development
    not just of the Peshitta OT but also the Syriac NT—to name only
    the most obvious. By its very nature, this is an extremely
    complex, ambitious undertaking. To be ambitious in one's
    dissertation (the volume under review is a dissertation
    submitted at Temple University [Philadelphia, USA] in 2001), is
    not, <hi rend="italic">per se</hi>, a bad thing. But it requires competent
    guidance from a <hi rend="italic">Doktorvater</hi> (or -<hi rend="italic">mutter</hi>), a
    committee familiar with the field, and proficiency on the part
    of the dissertationist: a command of the requisite literature,
    a feel for the nuances of this many-faceted problem,
    sensitivity to philological possibilities, and well developed
    logical and self-critical skills. This volume falls short on
    all these measures.</p>
         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P5"/>[5] The
    doctoral committee contained no experts on Biblical textual
    criticism, the Syriac Bible, or the Diatessaron. Whether the
    committee considered itself competent where it was not, or
    whether the committee was convinced that the student knew more
    than they did, is unknown. In either case, however, the
    committee has acted irresponsibly. The author, however, cannot
    be absolved, for even without competent guidance he should have
    recognized the illogical arguments, inconsistent standards,
    philological errors, and methodological blunders that mar this
    book. He has not. The result is a study that does not achieve
    its stated purposes.</p>
         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P6"/>[6] Let us
    begin by examining one of the book's stated goals: to show that
    "many of [the] divergences [between the OT citations in the
    Greek gospels and the OT citations in the Diatessaron] are not
    the result of Tatian's editorial work," but come from "an older
    form of the [OT] citation[s]...one that is closer to the
    original text of the gospels" (p. 2). To see how Shedinger
    would prove this claim, let us examine his analysis of Matt
    4:16, which is his second reading. (Shedinger's evidence
    consists of 69 unnumbered readings; for ease of reference, your
    reviewer has numbered them seriatim.)</p>
         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P7"/>[7]
    Shedinger claims he has reconstructed the Diatessaron's text of
    Matt 4:16, and concludes that the Diatessaron omitted the word
    "land" (or "region": "those who sat in [<hi rend="italic">a land</hi> of] the
    shadow of death..."). According to Shedinger, "The omission of
    any reference to 'region' or 'land' in a host of Diatessaronic
    witnesses is due simply to the fact that the original text of
    Matthew lacked this reference" (p. 45). In this manner,
    Shedinger uses this reading to support his claim that such
    deviations spring not from Tatian's pen, but reflect "an older
    form of the [OT] citation[s]," one that is, in this case
    (according to Shedinger), identical with "the original text of
    Matthew."</p>
         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P8"/>[8] There
    are two claims here: first, that the Diatessaron omitted the
    word "land," and, second, that this variant is "the original
    text of Matthew," and is not due to Tatian tampering with the
    text. In support of these two claims, Shedinger observes that
    the same omission is found in Clement of Alexandria (c. 200),
    Augustine (c. 400), and the Ethiopic version. The evidence of
    Clement is dubious, however: Shedinger acknowledges that
    Clement only "seems to allude to" this version of the text; one
    is, therefore, ultimately unsure of Clement's reading. From the
    omission in these two or three early references, Shedinger
    concludes that the omission was known in the early church. Upon
    that we can all agree. But observe: other than Shedinger's
    reconstructed reading of the Diatessaron (to which we will turn
    in a moment), the oldest evidence for the omission is Clement
    (c. 200)—and Clement's evidence is weak, since it is an
    allusion, not a quotation. Simple logic tells one that to go
    back from Augustine to an allusion in Clement, and from
    Clement's allusion to a (dubious) reconstruction of the
    Diatessaron's text, and then from this reconstruction of the
    Diatessaron to the "original text of Matthew," is a very
    tortured path. Shedinger has not navigated it successfully. The
    problems are numerous, grave, and obvious. Let us begin by
    looking at the reading itself, and then consider whether it is
    "the original text of Matthew."</p>
         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P9"/>[9] The
    first observation that strikes one is that the reading is an
    omission. Textual critics know that omissions are, <hi rend="italic">a
    priori</hi>, very weak evidence, for an omission is, strictly
    speaking, the <hi rend="italic">lack</hi> of evidence. Because one can never be
    certain what <hi rend="italic">caused</hi> an omission (in one case, an
    exemplar may have had a lacuna; in another case, a scribe may
    have made an error of the ear or eye; in another language, the
    idiom or alliteration may have been awkward, so a superfluous
    word was dropped; etc.), they are unreliable as indicators of
    textual filiation: one can never be sure the omission was
    caused by textual dependence, and not some other, completely
    unrelated phenomenon. An interpolation, by contrast, requires a
    specific act of <hi rend="italic">intention</hi> (an omission does not), and
    the conscious selection of the <hi rend="italic">identical</hi> word to add
    from the thousands of possible words (an omission does not);
    interpolations are, therefore, excellent markers of textual
    filiation; generally speaking (and certainly in the readings in
    this book), omissions are not.</p>
         <p rend="nn">
            <anchor xml:id="P10"/>[10]
    Second, Shedinger himself describes Matt 4:16 as a "composite"
    citation: according to him, it is a conflation of Is. 9:1 with
    Ps. 107 [LXX: 106]:10 (see pp. 41-45). One of these (Ps.
    107:10) omits the word "land," while the other (Is. 9:1)
    includes it. Because of the "dual" parentage of this citation,
    one might expect that, from the outset, scribes would have been
    fiddling with it, sometimes moving it closer to Isaiah,
    sometimes towards the Psalms, and sometimes towards a new (and,
    presumably, to the scribe), more agreeable conflation. (Such
    scribal "cross-referencing" of OT source[s] against their NT
    quotation—and subsequent "improvement"—is a well known and
    well-documented phenomenon.) Indeed, Shedinger himself notes
    that scribes have been playing with this very passage <hi rend="italic">in the
    Diatessaronic witnesses</hi>, for he writes: "If we look back to
    the text of the Persian Harmony, we find that it has collapsed
    the two halves of this poetic parallelism from Isaiah into a
    single statement... The Palestinian Syriac Lectionary, at least
    in its extant form, preserves both halves of the parallelism...
    In fact, later Greek scribes probably did not recognize the
    conflation; they only recognized that Matthew's text differed
    from Isaiah and needed to be 'corrected'" (pp. 44-45). Given
    all of this—where the genesis of the passage lies in a
    conflation, and where scribes have been almost continually
    adapting the citation—how, then, can one determine the
    Diatessaron's reading with any degree of accuracy and
    reliability? The answer, of course, is that one cannot. In a
    situation such as this, the only responsible action is to
    suspend judgment: we simply do not know—and have no means of
    determining—what the Diatessaron read.</p>
         <p rend="nn">
            <anchor xml:id="P11"/>[11] A
    third problem with this reading is the method by which
    Shedinger has determined that the omission of "land" is
    Diatessaronic. Shedinger has adopted (see p. 34) three
    "criteria" published by your reviewer for determining the
    likelihood that a variant is (or is not) Diatessaronic. The
    second of these three criteria—which Shedinger quotes—is: "[to
    be Diatessaronic, the] reading should <hi rend="italic">not</hi> be found in
    any non-Diatessaronic texts, from which the Diatessaronic
    witnesses [with the variant] might have acquired it" (p. 34).
    The reason for having such a criterion is rather obvious. If a
    variant reading occurs in Diatessaronic witnesses <hi rend="italic">and
    also</hi> in other texts or fathers that are <hi rend="italic">unrelated</hi> to
    the Diatessaron, then we are faced with an insoluble conundrum:
    the reading <hi rend="italic">may</hi> be Diatessaronic, but it is also
    possible that our Diatessaronic witnesses have been
    "contaminated," and acquired the variant <hi rend="italic">not</hi> from the
    Diatessaron, but from one of the non-Diatessaronic texts with
    the same variant. In such a circumstance, we will never be able
    to determine whether the reading came from the Diatessaron, or
    from some other source; therefore, the reading must be
    rejected.</p>
         <p rend="nn">
            <anchor xml:id="P12"/>[12]
    Although Shedinger says he is following this criterion, he
    clearly violates it in this reading: the very presence of the
    reading in Clement [?], Augustine and the Ethiopic mean that
    the reading must be discarded.</p>
         <p rend="nn">
            <anchor xml:id="P13"/>[13] So
    much for Shedinger's claim that the reading is Diatessaronic;
    now let us turn to his claim that this omission represents "the
    original text of Matthew." Although the assertion is certainly
    attention-getting, it is quite preposterous. There are so many
    problems with this claim that one hardly knows where to start.
    To begin with, as shown above, we cannot be sure what the
    Diatessaron read here—and the Diatessaron (c. 172 C.E.) would
    be the oldest evidence for this omission. By default, then, the
    oldest evidence for the reading becomes Clement (c. 200). But
    recall that Clement's reading is not a quotation, but an
    allusion. Therefore, our oldest unambiguous evidence for the
    omission is Augustine (c. 400).</p>
         <p rend="nn">
            <anchor xml:id="P14"/>[14]
    Shedinger's claim that the omission was known in the early
    church is granted: on that we can all agree. He apparently
    feels that the presence of this omission in Clement [?],
    Augustine, and the Ethiopic increases the probability that this
    is "the original text of Matthew"; it is his sole evidence. But
    is it possible that the first text to omit "land" may be
    Augustine? The answer must be "yes." Even if one were to
    grant—solely for argument's sake—that Clement and the
    Diatessaron omitted "land," is it possible that the Diatessaron
    was the first text to omit "land"? The answer must be "yes."
    Shedinger has not produced a shred of evidence to demonstrate
    that this was "the original text of Matthew," and not a
    redactional change made by Tatian, or, alternatively, a variant
    that arose in the third, fourth or even fifth century. There is
    no evidence to support Shedinger's claim, other than his
    assertion.</p>
         <p rend="nn">
            <anchor xml:id="P15"/>[15] At
    another level, this reading exemplifies the sort of stumbling
    logic that bedevils this book. In this particular case,
    Shedinger is advancing as "true" two mutually-exclusive
    arguments. The first argument is this: The omission of "land"
    is the "original text of Matthew" because the omission was
    widespread in early Christianity—it crops up in the
    Diatessaron, Clement [?], Augustine, and the Ethiopic. The
    presence of this omission in texts unrelated to the Diatessaron
    leaves only one possible source from which all of them might
    have obtained this omission: "the original text of Matthew."
    The second argument is this: The omission of "land" is
    Diatessaronic because it is found only in Diatessaronic texts,
    or texts related to the Diatessaron (recall that the criterion
    adopted by Shedinger requires presence of the variant
    <hi rend="italic">only</hi> in Diatessaronic witnesses; the variant cannot be
    present in non-Diatessaronic witnesses, from which our
    Diatessaronic witnesses might have been contaminated with the
    variant). Faced with these two arguments, one can only ask:
    Which is it? For if the non-Diatessaronic witnesses are
    <hi rend="italic">not</hi> related to the Diatessaron, then, indeed, they are
    independent witnesses to the variant in the early church—<hi rend="italic">but
    in that case, the variant cannot be claimed as
    "Diatessaronic,"</hi> for all of the witnesses with the reading
    may have obtained it from (to pick one name from thin air)
    Augustine. On the other hand, if the non-Diatessaronic
    witnesses <hi rend="italic">are</hi> related to the Diatessaron, then, indeed,
    one can claim the variant as "Diatessaronic," for there would
    be no non-Diatessaronic sources to contaminate our
    witnesses—<hi rend="italic">but in that case, there is no evidence that the
    variant was widespread in the early church:</hi> the variant
    might well have originated with Tatian in his Diatessaron;
    there is nothing to suggest it goes back to "the original text
    of Matthew."</p>
         <p rend="nn">
            <anchor xml:id="P16"/>[16] The
    remainder of this book is more of the same. Error simply
    compounds upon error. It is tempting to leave it at that, but a
    reader of this review deserves a sampling of the mistakes which
    lead to such a negative appraisal. Examining some of the
    remaining 68 readings will expose the methods, logic,
    philology, and evidence used, and show why these are all so
    unacceptable.</p>
         <p rend="nn">
            <anchor xml:id="P17"/>[17] In
    chapter 5, Shedinger presents 21 readings—about one-third of
    his total of 69 readings. All 21 must be dismissed on logical
    grounds. The reason is as follows. As is well known, scribes
    have always been "moving" texts in the direction of the
    "standard" text of their time and place. Over time, the same
    has occurred with the Diatessaronic witnesses: deviating
    readings have been eliminated, and replaced with the "standard"
    reading of a particular time and place. This phenomenon is
    known as "Vulgatization," and can be shown to have occurred
    again and again in Diatessaronic witnesses. Shedinger is
    familiar with Vulgatization, and even discusses it (p. 26).
    Because of Vulgatization, it follows logically that one can
    only determine Diatessaronic readings at points where the
    Diatessaron's text <hi rend="italic">deviates</hi> from the "standard" text
    (usually the researcher's collation base). In cases where the
    readings in Diatessaronic witnesses <hi rend="italic">agree</hi> with the
    standard text, one can never be sure whether the agreement is
    because of Vulgatization, or because the Diatessaron itself
    gave the "standard" reading. This problem—which is strictly
    logical in character—has been well known to Diatessaronic
    researchers since the time of Johann Christian Zahn, in 1814,
    and has guided methods since: "Large portions of the
    Diatessaron's original text agree verbatim with the text now
    found in the principal gospel manuscripts. Because of this, the

            <anchor xml:id="P18"/>[18]
    Despite the rather obvious logic of this reasoning, and despite
    the fact that Shedinger himself subscribes to this logic and
    method in chapters three and four (where all of the readings he
    presents are <hi rend="italic">deviations</hi> from the standard text), all of
    the readings in chapter five are places where the Diatessaron's
    text—according to Shedinger—was <hi rend="italic">identical</hi> with the
    standard gospel text. Did no one involved in the writing,
    approval, or publication of this book recognize that two
    entirely different, mutually-exclusive methodologies were being
    employed, side-by-side?</p>
         <p rend="nn">
            <anchor xml:id="P19"/>[19] The
    remaining 48 readings in chapters three and four are felled by
    one or (usually) more problems. We will limit ourselves to
    discussing only three.</p>
         <p rend="nn">
            <anchor xml:id="P20"/>[20] The
    first is the matter of "trivial" readings. By "trivial" we mean
    readings which turn on the tense or voice of a verb changing, a
    conjunction appearing (or disappearing), pronouns materializing
    (or vanishing), or words with overlapping semantic ranges
    replacing each other (door/gate; wilderness/desert;
    hastened/ran; etc.). One frequently stumbles across readings
    such as these in Diatessaronic studies. Are they significant?
    The answer is "no." Over the last century scholars have tested
    such readings to see what value they have as evidence for the
    text of the second-century Diatessaron. The unanimous
    conclusion is that they are almost always useless, and should
    almost always be ignored (the qualifications are too complex to
    lay out in this review, and are, in any event, irrelevant to
    Shedinger's readings).</p>
         <p rend="nn">
            <anchor xml:id="P21"/>[21] When
    one reflects on the wide variety of languages in which
    Diatessaronic witnesses appear (Syriac to Early Italian,
    Persian to Middle High German, Arabic to Latin, Pahlavi to
    Middle English, etc.) and the vast chronological span over
    which these witnesses were translated and copied (the earliest
    would appear to date from the first half of the fourth century
    [probably Aphrahat or, conceivably, some of the Syriac
    apocrypha]; the latest would be 1547 C.E. [the date our lone
    exemplar of the Persian Harmony was copied]), the reasons are
    self-evident. Idioms change from place to place and time to
    time. The grammatical norms and constraints of Syriac are
    different from Old High German—and both of them are different
    from the grammatical norms and constraints of Latin and
    Persian. Even within a single language, vocabulary and grammar
    change over time (Shakespeare's English is not ours); it even
    varies within the same language, at the same time, but in
    different places (or classes): in certain English-speaking
    circles today, "He is taller than <hi rend="italic">I</hi>" is considered
    correct usage ("than" is construed as a conjunction, and one
    mentally completes the unspoken comparison "...taller than I
    [am tall]"), while in other circles "He is taller than
    <hi rend="italic">me</hi>" is considered correct ("than" is construed as a
    preposition, requiring the objective case, "me").</p>
         <p rend="nn">
            <anchor xml:id="P22"/>[22] All
    of this is obvious, and is well known in Diatessaronic studies.
    Agnes Smith Lewis pointed it out to H. J. Vogels in 1913,
    noting especially the tendency of Syriac to add pleonastic
    pronouns and conjunctions, the former due in part to suffix
    pronouns and the latter due in part to the Semitic aversion to
    subordinate clauses. The point has been repeated many times
    since: "I find many of the individual cases produced by the
    experts too niggling and unimpressive" (so the distinguished
    Orientalist Fr. Robert Murray, <hi rend="italic">HeyJ</hi> 14 [1973], p. 312);
    "some of the coincidences in small similarities between
    [Diatessaronic] witnesses may have originated accidentally or
    from independent exegetical modifications" (so Bruce Metzger,
    <hi rend="italic">JThS</hi> n.s. 27 [1976], p. 481). Nevertheless, some 22 of
    Shedinger's readings are textual trivia. For example, he
    detects a "Diatessaronic" reading in the change of verb voice
    in readings 21 and 35 (where an active voice in the Greek
    becomes passive in some Diatessaronic witnesses) and in reading
    12 (passive voice becomes active). More "Diatessaronic"
    readings are found in the change in some witnesses from
    "<hi rend="italic">their</hi> heart" (so the Greek) to "<hi rend="italic">its</hi> heart"
    (reading 32, Matt 15:8); the interpolation of "and" in reading
    28 (Matt 4:7 parr.), where (according to Shedinger) the
    Diatessaron inserted "and" into the phrase "the Lord [+
    <hi rend="italic">and</hi>] your God." In reading 15 (Matt 4:6) the matter
    turns on whether "foot" is in the objective case (so Matthew)
    or the nominative case (so some Diatessaronic witnesses);
    shades of "He is taller than I/me" in today's vernacular!
    Reading 18 (Matt 15:4, par.) finds the canonical "or" turning
    into a "Diatessaronic" "and"—this despite the fact that the OT
    lemma (Ex. 21:17) in Hebrew has "and," while the LXX reads
    "or," with the gospels; that means that if only two scribes
    independently checked the NT citation against the Hebrew, and
    corrected it to the Hebrew, then we would have a
    "Diatessaronic" reading here—without, of course, any contact
    with the Diatessaron! All of these readings are precisely the
    sort of textual trivia warned against in the literature for
    nearly a century. They must be rejected.</p>
         <p rend="nn">
            <anchor xml:id="P23"/>[23]
    Turning to another problem, five of Shedinger's readings are
    omissions. As we saw above (in reading 2, the omission of
    "land"), omissions are very weak as evidence, and are highly
    unreliable in Diatessaronic studies as genetic markers. As with
    "trivial" readings, so too the problems with omissions are
    well-documented in the literature—not just of Diatessaronic
    studies, but also of textual criticism. But once again,
    Shedinger shows no awareness of this.</p>
         <p rend="nn">
            <anchor xml:id="P24"/>[24] The
    third and final problem we will address is the defective
    philological and lexical work, which eliminates about ten of
    Shedinger's readings. If there is any place in Diatessaronic
    studies where scrupulous honesty and care are required, it is
    here. The reason is that Diatessaronic research is a two-act
    play involving lexical agreements and disagreements. The first
    act of the play consists of noting textual <hi rend="italic">disjunctions</hi>:
    one searches for readings where the Diatessaronic witnesses
    differ from the standard gospel text. Here are some of the
    differences Shedinger finds; they eventually result in
    "Diatessaronic" readings: reading 1, "ruler" (= Matt 2:6b) and
    "king" (= Diatessaron); reading 10, "adultery" (= Matt 19:18,
    par.) and "fornication"/"impure" (= Diat.); 25, "robbers" (=
    Matt 21:13, parr.) and "thieves" (= Diat.). It is to be granted
    that in English these words are different, but it is also
    evident that their semantic ranges are very, very close.
    Shedinger is making very fine, very precise distinctions here;
    he is distinguishing very rigorously even between synonyms
    ("thieves" and "robbers," for example). Therefore, at the very
    outset, one must question whether such rigid distinctions can
    be made. Most lexicographers would say "no," because what one
    is probably registering is simply different translations of the
    same word: the German "Fleisch" can be translated into English
    as either "meat" or "flesh," and both translations are
    correct.</p>
         <p rend="nn">
            <anchor xml:id="P25"/>[25] But
    there is also a second act in the play of Diatessaronic
    studies: after identifying the points of variance from the
    standard text, one then looks to see if there are
    <hi rend="italic">conjunctions</hi> among the Diatessaronic witnesses—if
    <hi rend="italic">multiple</hi> Diatessaronic witnesses contain the
    <hi rend="italic">identical</hi> variant. This <hi rend="italic">multiple testimony</hi> is
    necessary to prevent a unique reading in a single witness being
    called "Diatessaronic." Finally, to insure against the
    influence of "local texts" (which might have influenced
    multiple Diatessaronic witnesses in a particular geographic
    region—say, in Syria/Syriac, or in Italy/Latin), support for
    the proposed Diatessaronic reading should be found in
    <hi rend="italic">both</hi> the Eastern <hi rend="italic">and</hi> the Western witnesses.</p>
         <p rend="nn">
            <anchor xml:id="P26"/>[26]
    Given the rigor Shedinger employed to distinguish between the
    text of the gospels and the Diatessaronic witnesses (recall,
    for example, that he distinguished "robbers" from "thieves"),
    one would expect him to be equally rigorous when searching for
    agreements among Diatessaronic witnesses. That is not, however,
    what we find. In reading 10 (Matt 19:18, parr.), where the
    Greek reads "adultery," Shedinger finds an ambiguous word in
    the Arabic Harmony (which he says can mean either "adultery" or
    "fornication"); in the West, he finds "fornication" in some
    Vetus Latina manuscripts, and "impure" in two related Middle
    Dutch Harmonies. Shedinger construes "impure" and "fornication"
    as the same variant. Something other than "adultery"
    ("fornication"? "impure"? one is never informed precisely what)
    is the Diatessaronic reading. But any observant reader will
    ask: If our author distinguishes between "king" and "ruler,"
    between "thieves" and "robbers," then must he not also
    distinguish between "fornication" and "impure," and regard
    <hi rend="italic">them</hi> as <hi rend="italic">two</hi> distinct variants? This question does
    not seem to have occurred to anyone connected with this book.
    Furthermore, since the reading of the Arabic Harmony is
    ambiguous, and <hi rend="italic">may</hi> be the standard Greek reading, how
    can Shedinger claim it as Eastern support for whatever
    "Diatessaronic" reading he proposes? The answer, of course, is
    that he cannot.</p>
         <p rend="nn">
            <anchor xml:id="P27"/>[27] This
    same insensitivity to lexical differences is displayed again
    and again, and the result is always the same: a "Diatessaronic"
    reading. For example, in reading 13 (Matt 27:9-10) one
    Diatessaronic witness reads "I was valued," and two (related)
    witnesses read "I was bought"; despite their differences
    ("bought" is not "valued"; one can "value" something without
    "buying" it), Shedinger pronounces a conjunction of witnesses
    here, and, of course, a "Diatessaronic" reading is the result.
    Or consider reading 8 (Matt 13:35 [the Greek reads "I will
    utter"]), where Shedinger says that "I will bring to light" and
    "I will reveal" and "I will make clear" all represent a single
    "Diatessaronic" variant.</p>
         <p rend="nn">
            <anchor xml:id="P28"/>[28] What
    is going on here? It is really quite simple: Shedinger is using
    two different sets of standards when making lexical
    comparisons. When he wants to find differences, his standards
    are rigorous ("thieves" are not "robbers"; a "king" is not a
    "ruler"). But when he wants to find agreements, his standards
    are so loose that they defy the lexica ("bought" is the same as
    "valued"; "impure" is the same as "fornication"). This is not
    only unacceptable lexicography, it is also methodologically
    dishonest: <hi rend="italic">one</hi> set of standards should be used.</p>
         <p rend="nn">
            <anchor xml:id="P29"/>[29] The
    lexical problems do not end there, however; "Diatessaronic"
    readings are sometimes manufactured out of elementary lexical
    blunders. Here are two examples. In reading 23 (Matt 4:6, par.
    Luke 4:11) Shedinger claims that the reading of the Diatessaron
    was "arms" against what he considers the standard Greek reading
    "hands." The problem is that the text of Matthew (and Luke)
    reads, "...On their <hi rend="gr">
               <hi rend="italic">ceirwn</hi>
            </hi> they
    will bear you up..." This is a quotation of Ps. 91:12, where
    the LXX also reads <hi rend="gr">
               <hi rend="italic">ceirwn</hi>
            </hi>.
    Shedinger concludes that "arms" is the Diatessaronic reading
    because the Syriac word <hi style="letter-spacing:1">
               <hi rend="italic">dr<hi rend="sup">c</hi>'</hi>
            </hi>—which J. Payne
    Smith defines as "arm" (<hi rend="italic">A Compendious Syriac Dictionary</hi>
    [the "little Payne Smith"; Oxford 1903], p. 98)—is found in
    some Diatessaronic witnesses (in Matthew in Syr<hi rend="sup">s.c</hi>
    and in Luke in Syr<hi rend="sup">p</hi>; "arms" is also read in the
    Arabic and Persian Harmonies). Against this, other
    Diatessaronic witnesses in Syriac (Syr<hi rend="sup">s</hi> in Luke and
    Syr<hi rend="sup">p</hi> in Matthew) read <hi rend="italic">yd</hi>
    ("<hi rend="italic">hand</hi>,...<hi rend="italic">forepaw</hi>; <hi rend="italic">the axle</hi> of a wheel
    [<hi rend="italic">N.B.</hi>!]; <hi rend="italic">the arm</hi> of a seat or throne
    [<hi rend="italic">N.B.</hi>!]; <hi rend="italic">a handle</hi> [<hi rend="italic">N.B.</hi>!]..." [Payne
    Smith, p. 186; the italics are hers]). In support of his
    conclusion that "arm[s]"—<hi style="letter-spacing:1">
               <hi rend="italic">dr<hi rend="sup">c</hi>'</hi>
            </hi>—is the reading
    of the Diatessaron, Shedinger writes that "it is not easy to
    reconcile [the Syriac] <hi style="letter-spacing:1">
               <hi rend="italic">dr<hi rend="sup">c</hi>
               </hi>

    <hi rend="gr">
               <hi rend="italic">ceiroV</hi>
            </hi> [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>]" (p.
    96).</p>
         <p rend="nn">
            <anchor xml:id="P30"/>[30] This
    statement is simply not true of the Greek <hi rend="gr">
               <hi rend="italic">ceir</hi>
            </hi>—and remember that Tatian was working
    from the Greek gospels. Reference to any Greek lexicon will
    show that <hi rend="gr">
               <hi rend="italic">ceir</hi>
            </hi> is polysemous,
    and can mean <hi rend="italic">either</hi> "hand" <hi rend="italic">or</hi> "arm" (see,

    <hi rend="italic">abnegabis</hi> [<hi rend="italic">abnegaveris</hi> in <hi rend="italic">k</hi>])." Although
    he should have abandoned the reading at this point—for
    "oppress" is not the same as "deny"—Shedinger forges ahead, and
    pronounces a "Diatessaronic" reading.</p>
         <p rend="nn">
            <anchor xml:id="P35"/>[35] The
    problem is that, just like <hi rend="gr">
               <hi rend="italic">ceir</hi>
            </hi>
    in the previous example, <hi rend="gr">
               <hi rend="italic">aposterew</hi>
            </hi> is polysemous. Reference to a
    Greek lexicon will show that although the <hi rend="italic">first</hi> meaning
    of <hi rend="gr">
               <hi rend="italic">aposterew</hi>
            </hi> is "defraud," its
    <hi rend="italic">second</hi> meaning is "refuse" or "deny"; it is, for
    example, also used in I Cor. 7:5, which is commonly translated
    as "do not <hi rend="italic">deny</hi> (<hi rend="gr">
               <hi rend="italic">aposterew</hi>
            </hi>) your wives." It is true that the
    majority of Vetus Latina MSS (and the Vulgate) read <hi rend="italic">fraudem
    feceris</hi> (so MSS <hi rend="italic">aur</hi> 
            <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 
            <hi rend="italic">d</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">ff<hi rend="sup">2</hi>
            </hi> 
            <hi rend="italic">l</hi> 
            <hi rend="italic">q</hi>; MS <hi rend="italic">f</hi> reads
    <hi rend="italic">fraudem facies</hi>), rendering the <hi rend="italic">first</hi> meaning of
    <hi rend="gr">
               <hi rend="italic">aposterew</hi>
            </hi> ("defraud"). But
    <hi rend="italic">abnegabis</hi> is an equally good—and, in some respects,
    better—translation of the Greek, rendering the <hi rend="italic">second</hi>
    meaning of <hi rend="gr">
               <hi rend="italic">aposterew</hi>
            </hi>, "refuse,
    deny." We say "better" because, from a strictly linguistic
    standpoint, <hi rend="italic">abnegabis</hi> is (1) a <hi rend="italic">single</hi> Latin word
    translating a <hi rend="italic">single</hi> Greek word (such things were
    important to the ancients), and (2) the <hi rend="italic">ab-</hi> prefix of
    <hi rend="italic">abnegabis</hi> displays parallel compositional morphology
    with the <hi rend="gr">
               <hi rend="italic">apo-</hi>
            </hi> prefix of
    <hi rend="gr">
               <hi rend="italic">aposterew</hi>
            </hi>. (As an aside, your
    reviewer would note that it is interesting—and perhaps
    significant—that our two oldest Vetus Latina MSS [<hi rend="italic">a k</hi>]
    read <hi rend="italic">abnegabis</hi>, while the more recent ones—and the
    Vulgate—read <hi rend="italic">fraudem fecit</hi>. This suggests
    <hi rend="italic">abnegabis</hi> is the older translation.)</p>
         <p rend="nn">
            <anchor xml:id="P36"/>[36]
    Shedinger's claim, then, that the Latin reading
    <hi rend="italic">abnegabis</hi>—the sole Western support for his proposed
    "Diatessaronic" reading—represents something other than the
    standard Greek of Mark, is simply false. For evidence of a
    "Diatessaronic" reading, then, one is left with "oppress," a
    reading that is found only in three late Diatessaronic
    witnesses (the Peshitta, and the Arabic and Persian Harmonies),
    all from the East, and all derived from a Syriac
    <hi rend="italic">Vorlage</hi>. The evidence suggests, then, that this reading
    is most likely a relatively late variant, part of a "local
    text" that circulated only in the East.</p>
         <p rend="nn">
            <anchor xml:id="P37"/>[37]
    These sorts of errors—in a book whose subtitle announces a
    "Philological Analysis"—are beyond comprehension. Did no one on
    the doctoral committee know that <hi rend="gr">
               <hi rend="italic">ceir</hi>
            </hi> can mean both "hand" and "arm"? Did it
    occur to no reader at CSCO that if "robbers" were being
    distinguished from "thieves," then one also ought to
    distinguish—if for nothing else than consistency's sake—between
    "valued" and "bought"?</p>
         <p rend="nn">
            <anchor xml:id="P38"/>[38] The
    book has other flaws, as well. The command of current
    literature is defective. Although this book was published in
    2001, Migne is used for Justin Martyr's text, not the critical
    editions of Goodspeed (1914) or Marcovich (1997); Sievers'
    sometimes-defective second edition (1892) of Codex Sangallensis
    is used rather than Masser's excellent new edition (1994).
    Although Shedinger relies very heavily on your reviewer's
    handbook <hi rend="italic">Tatian's Diatessaron</hi> (1994), he displays no
    awareness of a substantial chapter titled "Using the
    Diatessaron" (pp. 357-425). This chapter begins with a list of
    potential "Problems" awaiting the novice researcher. The first
    "problem" listed is "Arguing from omissions" (pp. 359-360); the
    second is "Arguing from trivial readings" (360-361); the fifth
    is "Arguing from what may be 'local texts'" (364); the seventh
    is "Arguing from grammatical, syntactic, or orthographic
    trivia" (365-367); the eighth is "Arguing from a dubious
    translation" (367-368). Of course one does not have to read
    this chapter to gain these insights; anyone reading the
    literature listed in Shedinger's bibliography would have come
    to the same realizations, although it would have taken longer
    and required that one laboriously order the material one's
    self.</p>
         <p rend="nn">
            <anchor xml:id="P39"/>[39] A
    prerequisite for reliable and proper use of a Diatessaronic
    witness is a thorough understanding of its
    transmission-history. Although Shedinger used Giuseppe
    Messina's edition of the Persian Harmony, he apparently failed
    to notice Messina's analysis of the text, for in the
    "Introduction" to his edition Messina addresses the subject of
    Shedinger's book: the OT quotations in the (Persian)
    Diatessaron (pp. lxviii-lxxvi). Messina (* 1893-† 1951) was the
    world's expert on this text. In the process of preparing his
    edition, Messina concluded that the Persian translator, as he
    translated from Syriac into Persian in the thirteenth century,
    frequently "improved" the OT quotations by referencing the
    <hi rend="italic">Targumim</hi> and/or the Hebrew Bible in a Semitic language.
    Messina's textual examples (two of which parallel pericopes
    examined by Shedinger) are unambiguous and definitive.
    Therefore, Shedinger cannot use the Persian Harmony as he does,
    for Messina demonstrated half a century ago that its OT
    citations have frequently been revised to agree with texts much
    later than the Diatessaron. Even if these eight pages in
    Italian escaped our author's notice, it is odd that he also
    missed an English <hi rend="italic">précis</hi> of them in a book he frequently
    cites.</p>
         <p rend="nn">
            <anchor xml:id="P40"/>[40] In
    the end, one wonders how much of the bibliography was actually
    consulted, for Shedinger's bibliography gives the following
    entry: "Plooij, Daniel, <hi rend="italic">Traces of Syriac Origin of the
    Old-Latin Diatessaron</hi>. Amsterdam: n.p., 1927." Anyone
    attempting to locate this book from Shedinger's reference will
    come up empty-handed. That is because it is an article: "Traces
    of Syriac Origin of the Old-Latin Diatessaron," in
    <hi rend="italic">Mededeelingen der koninklijke akademie van
    wetenschappen</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Afdeeling letterkunde</hi>, deel 63, serie
    A, no. 4 (1927), pp. 101-126. Whether he actually consulted the
    article or not (a glance at the title page—which bears the
    pagination "101"—reveals instantly that the work is an article,
    not a book), the full, correct reference was (once again)
    available to Shedinger in the bibliography of a monograph he
    frequently cites.</p>
         <p rend="nn">
            <anchor xml:id="P41"/>[41] One
    could go on. Everyone has lapses of judgment; everyone makes
    mistakes—even Homer nodded. But that is not the issue. Here the
    errors are so frequent and so fundamental that this volume can
    contribute nothing to scholarship. What it says that is true
    has already been said elsewhere, with greater clarity and
    perspective. What it says that is new is almost always wrong,
    plagued—as we have shown above—with philological, logical, and
    methodological errors, and a gross insensitivity to things
    historical (both within the discipline, as well as the
    transmission-history of texts). Reading this book fills one
    with dismay and despair. It is shocking that a work which does
    not rise to the level of a master's thesis should be approved
    as a doctoral dissertation; how it found its way into print is
    unfathomable. One shudders to think of the damage it will do
    when, in the future, it is cited by the ignorant and the
    unsuspecting as "demonstrating" what it has not.</p>

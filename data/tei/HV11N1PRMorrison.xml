            <anchor xml:id="P1"/>[1] During
    his long association with the Peshitta Institute, Konrad Jenner
    has warmly welcomed Peshitta scholars from around the world and
    stimulated their research. This volume celebrates the fruits of
    his efforts. It begins with his academic biography and an
    abstract of each article. As the title of the volume indicates,
    the articles treat textual questions, translation techniques,
    and the history of the Peshitta�s reception.</p>
         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P2"/>[2] The
    volume opens with Pier G. Borbone�s study of a funerary tile
    from Chifeng (ca. 350 km north-east of Beijing) that contains a
    Syriac inscription of Ps 34:6. This inscription is compared
    with that on the Fangshan stone and the Peshitta text. By way
    of conclusion, Borbone wonders if �the quotations of Ps 34:6 in
    the Chifeng and Fangshan bears witness to the use of decorated
    Syriac <hi style="font-variant:small-caps">Mss</hi> in the
    Far East� (p. 10). In another text critical contribution,
    Sebastian Brock, returning to his Isaiah edition in the
    <hi rend="italic">Vetus Testament Syriace,</hi> discusses a text of unknown
    provenance that was added to Peshitta ms 17a1 and 17a4. He
    translates this text and discusses its curious additions. Janet
    Dyk and Percy van Keulen study the Peshitta translation of 2
    Kgs 24:14 to illustrate the relationship �between translation
    strategy and the requirements of the language system, both at
    the level of the choice of words and at the level of phrase
    structure� (p. 56). Jan Joosten adduces evidence to show that
    the Hebrew text behind the Peshitta in Deut 1:44 (�and chased
    you as bees driven out by smoke�) is the more original reading
    than the MT (�and chased you as bees do�). Arie van der Kooij
    questions the role that <hi style="font-variant:small-caps">Ms</hi> 9a1 can play in
    establishing the earliest Peshitta text. After discussing
    several of its readings he concludes that the value of 9a1 �as
    a witness of the earliest (attainable) text is limited indeed�
    (p. 76). Marinus D. Koster considers the possibility that the
    Lectionary <hi style="font-variant:small-caps">Ms</hi> 10l1
    together with <hi style="font-variant:small-caps">Ms</hi>
    5b1 represent an earlier stage of the Peshitta (closer to the
    Hebrew). His results for Genesis are �unequivocal�: �there is
    no relationship whatsoever of 10l1 with 5b1 and its additions
    8/5b1 and 10/5b1� (p. 84-85). The situation does not change for
    other books of the OT. Micha�l N. van der Meer examines the
    Peshitta reading in Jos 1:7 and concludes that the translation
    of <hi lang="SYR"
                dir="rtl"
                style="font-size:16.0pt;font-family:'Estrangelo Edessa'"
                xml:lang="SYR">ܢܡܘܣܐ</hi> for Hebrew <hi lang="HE" dir="rtl" style="font-size:16.0pt" xml:lang="HE">התורה</hi> was influenced by
    the context. Lucas Van Rompay focuses on a version of Syriac
    Judith discovered in Kerala twenty years ago (the Trivandrum
    <hi style="font-variant:small-caps">Ms</hi> ). When
    compared with the Peshitta, this <hi style="font-variant:small-caps">Ms</hi> is longer, closer to the
    Greek, and reflects a different state of the language. It turns
    out to be a revision of the Peshitta with help from the Greek.
    Van Rompay dates the Peshitta text prior to the fifth-century
    while the Trivandrum <hi style="font-variant:small-caps">Ms</hi> , because of its
    similarities to the Syro-Hexapla and the Harklean version of
    the Gospels, reflects a sixth- or seventh-century text. A
    curious insertion that identifies Nebuchadnezzar with the
    Persian king Cambyses is �a response to those critics who, on
    the basis of its historical errors, were willing to dismiss the
    book of Judith as irrelevant� (p. 228).</p>
         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P3"/>[3] On the
    question of translation technique, Gillian Greenberg�s study of
    lexical choices in Isaiah and Jeremiah reveals that Peshitta
    translators �apparently felt free to deviate occasionally from
    a word-for-word rendering of their Vorlagen� (p. 62). Donald M.
    Walter shows Peshitta <hi style="font-variant:small-caps">Ms</hi> 7a1 and related
    <hi style="font-variant:small-caps">Mss</hi> of Jeremiah
    represent a deliberate revision (as he has already shown in 1
    and 2 Kings). Takamitsu Muraoka studies the particle
    <hi lang="SYR"
                dir="rtl"
                style="font-size:16.0pt;font-family: 'Estrangelo Edessa'"
                xml:lang="SYR">ܐܝܬ</hi> and concludes that its use as a �pure copula
    was not totally foreign to the �spirit� of the Syriac language
    and its development was reinforced by constant exposure on the
    part of some Syriac writers to Greek� (p. 134). Wido van
    Peursen considers the discourse structure and clause hierarchy
    in Sirach 14:20-27 and concludes that his clause hierarchical
    analysis �leads to an unequivocal division of this section into
    three units� (p. 148). Eep Talstra and Janet Dyk suggest how
    computer assisted research can do more than simply imitate
    �classical instruments.� Without a doubt, Syriac readers hope
    that their expectations for the computer can be realized in the
    near future.</p>
         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P4"/>[4] On the
    question of text reception history, David Lane�s article
    reminds us of how much we miss his insights and wit. He studies
    the origins of the �Rogation of the Ninevites,� a popular
    devotion among Syriac Christians in Kerala, to reveal the use
    of scripture in this liturgy. Bas ter Haar Romeny examines the
    reception of Peshitta Isaiah among the Syriac Fathers. His
    careful discussion of the Syriac commentary tradition
    underscores the challenges of identifying Peshitta citations
    and the importance of such citations for understanding the
    textual history of the Syriac versions within the cultural
    history of Syriac Christianity. Harry F. van Rooy examines the
    Syriac text of the Psalms in the shorter of the two Syriac
    versions of Athanasius� Greek Commentary on Psalms. He
    concludes: �In the case of the text used in the shorter version
    of the commentary, traces can be found of the text used in the
    longer version, as well as the text of the Peshitta and the
    Syro-Hexapla� (p. 174). Alison Salvesen responds to questions
    posed by Konrad Jenner in his 1993 paper at the Peshitta
    Symposium regarding the nature of Jacob of Edessa�s version of
    the OT. She considers three passages from this version and
    concludes that Jacob�s notion of �correction� was �to amplify
    the Peshitta text with secondary readings from the Greek, or to
    replace difficult sections in it with less ambiguous phrasing
    from the Septuagint� (p. 188). Piet Dirksen traces the recent
    developments in the reception of the Peshitta through a concise
    history of the Peshitta Institute and a review of the research
    accomplished through its impetus.</p>
         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P5"/>[5] This
    volume presents the current state of Peshitta research to a
    beloved scholar who has been a vital stimulus through his
    graceful presence at the Peshitta Institute in recent decades.
    This reviewer would like to add his voice to this chorus of
    gratitude to Konrad Jenner for his kind welcome to me in Leiden
    over the years. Ad moltos annos!</p>

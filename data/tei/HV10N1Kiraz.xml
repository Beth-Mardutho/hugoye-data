         <div type="abstract">
            <p>The term “Syriac Computing” was
    coined in 1992 and took shape in 1995 when the First
    International Forum on Syriac Computing was held in conjunction
    with the Second Syriac Symposium in Washington, DC. The term
    was applied to computer-related activities and projects which
    support Syriac studies. Syriac computing, however, began much
    earlier though on a small scale. On the 10th anniversary of
    <hi rend="italic">Hugoye</hi> and the 15th anniversary of its parent, Beth
    Mardutho, whose contributions to Syriac computing are well
    known, this paper aims to outline the history of Syriac
    computing and offer some considerations for the
    future.</p>

         <head xml:id="HV10N1Kiraz3">Computational Lexicography</head>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P1"/>[1] The
    first project that is known to me which employed computer
    systems for the study of Syriac falls within the domain of
    computational lexicography, and is only known through oral
    tradition. Stanislav Segert, former Professor at University of
    California, Los Angeles (UCLA) from whom I learned this in the
    mid 1980s, heard that someone at UCLA had encoded
    Brockelmann’s <hi rend="italic">Lexicon Syriacum</hi> on a mainframe
    computer system back in the 1960s. He attempted to trace down
    the data during his tenure, but was unable to find anything.
    One can speculate that at minimum these data contained a
    transcription of the Syriac lexemes in the <hi rend="italic">Lexicon</hi>,
    maybe with Latin correspondences as well. It is unknown if more
    linguistic data tagging was applied, such as morphological
    information. The data must have been entered using punch cards.
    Nothing is known about the intention of the project; it may
    have been simply a study aid.</p>

         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P2"/>[2] Later
    lexicographical projects aimed at the generation of
    concordances, primarily to biblical texts. These are discussed
    below in chronological order.</p>
         <head xml:id="HV10N1Kiraz4">The Göttingen Project</head>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P3"/>[3] In 1970,
    an ambitious project began in Göttingen to publish
    concordances to Biblical texts. The project was called Der
    Göttinger Syrischen Konkordanz, and used Fortran IV as its
    programming language.<ref target="#FN1">1</ref> The resulting concordances were
    subsequently published.<ref target="#FN2">2</ref>
         </p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P4"/>[4] The data
    model of the Göttingen project was a simple one. Tables
    were saved in flat files, where each line in a file represented
    a record. Fields in each record were fixed-length. Entering
    data was a challenge in its own right. Someone who must have
    known Syriac, or at least the Syriac alphabet, transcribed data
    on data cards. The data was then entered, by someone who did
    not have to know Syriac, using a traditional keyboard used to
    generate a punch card. The punch card was then fed to an IBM
    mainframe computer. Syriac text was entered using simple
    transcription (one-to-one mapping from Syriac letters to
    ASCII).</p>
         <head xml:id="HV10N1Kiraz5">The Way International Project</head>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P5"/>[5] Also in
    1970, and probably unknown to the Syriac studies community at
    the time, The Way International, a “nondenominational,
    nonsectarian Biblical research, teaching and fellowship
    ministry” (as it describes itself on its web site), began
    an ambitious project to create a Syriac concordance to the
    Syriac New Testament. The Way was motivated by George
    Lamsa’s unfounded claims that the Peshitta is superior to
    the Greek New Testament and represents an original Aramaic
    version of the New Testament.<ref target="#FN3">3</ref> During a period of 15 years, The
    Way managed to encode the entire Syriac New Testament, with a
    comprehensive lexical database. The concordance<ref target="#FN4">4</ref> that came out of
    the project was a mere word list, despite the fact that the
    data model was sufficient to create a concordance as detailed
    as the one produced later by Kiraz.<ref target="#FN5">5</ref> The Way managed to publish
    other useful tools from the project: an edition of the New
    Testament in the Estrangelo script,<ref target="#FN6">6</ref> an inter-linear
    Syriac-English edition of the Peshitta New Testament,<ref target="#FN7">7</ref> and an
    English-Syriac index.<ref target="#FN8">8</ref> At the time, The Way initially made these
    publications available to individuals who were not members of
    their organization. I managed to obtain a set!</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P6"/>[6] The data
    model employed here was based on a relational database. The
    data were later made available through the Ancient Biblical
    Manuscript Center (Claremont, CA). The Center received this
    data on a single magnetic reel-to-reel tape containing twelve
    data files. The format was created on an IBM System 38
    computer. The files were downloaded onto sixteen 364K, 5
    ¼" floppy disks in a PC environment with the help of the
    Academic Computer Center at the Claremont Graduate School. Each
    record type was represented in a flat file, one record per
    line. Fields were fixed-length. The data was later utilized by
    Kiraz in the SEDRA database project (see below).</p>
         <head xml:id="HV10N1Kiraz6">Borbone / The Peshitta Institute</head>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P7"/>[7] During
    the 1980s, Pier Giorgio Borbone developed a computational
    system with which he produced a number of concordances to
    Biblical texts. Description of this system can be found in
    various papers.<ref target="#FN9">9</ref> The Borbone system has been developed further
    and is currently being used for the generation of the Leiden
    Peshitta concordance, of which one volume has already
    appeared.<ref target="#FN10">10</ref>
         </p>
         <head xml:id="HV10N1Kiraz7">Kiraz’s SEDRA Database</head>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P8"/>[8] The
    initial work of George Kiraz’s lexical work goes back to
    1984 when he began encoding existing lexica in relational
    databases. The first attempt was to encode an Arabic-Syriac
    version of Costaz’s dictionary.<ref target="#FN11">11</ref> Only the letters
    Olaph-Dolath were entered at the time. In a second attempt
    during 1990, Kiraz tried getting an international group of
    volunteers to encode Margoliouth’s Syriac-English
    dictionary through Alaph Beth Computer Systems. The system was
    called in Syriac <hi rend="italic">sedra</hi> “array” as
    databases are considered arrays of data. The acronym SEDRA at
    the time stood for “Syriac Electronic Data Research
    Archive.”<ref target="#FN12">12</ref> In this case too, very little was achieved. On
    March 2, 1988, Kiraz signed an agreement with the Ancient
    Biblical and Manuscript Center and incorporated its data into
    SEDRA. The system was used to publish a detailed concordance to
    the Syriac New Testament, and a pedagogical word list to assist
    students in learning New Testament Syriac.<ref target="#FN13">13</ref> Recently, Logos
    Research Systems incorporated SEDRA in its Scholar’s
    Library.<ref target="#FN14">14</ref> In addition, a team of international scholars
    are currently using SEDRA to generate an interlinear to the
    Syriac New Testament. SEDRA is available for download from the
    Beth Mardutho web site (<ref target="http://www.bethmardutho.org/">http://www.bethmardutho.org</ref>). A number of
    online tools have already been implemented using SEDRA.<ref target="#FN15">15</ref>
         </p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P9"/>[9] SEDRA
    went through three incarnations. SEDRA I (1989) derived from
    the database provided by The Way International through the
    Ancient Biblical and Manuscript Center. As flat files were not
    necessarily efficient for modeling databases, the relational
    database was converted for use in db_VISTA,<ref target="#FN16">16</ref> a database
    management system that provided a programmable interface in the
    C programming language for writing database applications. In
    the next incarnation, SEDRA II (1990), additional tables and
    fields necessary for the generation of Kiraz’s
    <hi rend="italic">Concordance</hi> were added. Moreover, the entire text of
    the New Testament was vocalized and pointed, punctuation marks
    were added, and the text was normalized to represent the BFBS
    edition of the Syriac New Testament,<ref target="#FN17">17</ref> as the text used
    by The Way was based on other manuscripts, primarily from the
    British Museum.<ref target="#FN18">18</ref> To accomplish the vocalization and pointing
    process, a program was written that skipped over words which
    had been already vocalized.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P10"/>[10]
    Initial <hi rend="italic">bgdkpt</hi> letters were always marked with a
    <hi rend="italic">qushshaya</hi> point; an algorithm was written to convert
    the <hi rend="italic">qushshaya</hi> into <hi rend="italic">rukkakha</hi> if the preceding
    word, if any, ended in a vowel and was not followed by a
    punctuation mark. The dot on the feminine object pronominal
    suffix was not included in the pointing, and is to be added by
    another algorithm based on the existing morphological data. The
    same applies to <hi rend="italic">seyame</hi>. Many of the online tools that
    generated NT texts from downloading SEDRA ignored these
    features and hence produced texts without <hi rend="italic">seyame</hi> and
    the feminine marker.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P11"/>[11] The
    next incarnation of the project was SEDRA III (1991). The first
    change was the move from a relational model to a network model
    where ordered, one-to-many parent-child relations provided ease
    for concordance generation. The technical aspects of this model
    have been described in detail elsewhere.<ref target="#FN19">19</ref> SEDRA III
    contains 2,050 roots, 3,559 Lexemes, 31,079 word forms and
    6,337 English meanings (particular to the context of the New
    Testament).</p>
         <head xml:id="HV10N1Kiraz8">Brigham Young University’s Bar Bahlul
    Project</head>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P12"/>[12] In
    early 1998, ISPART (then CPART) commissioned G. Kiraz to
    implement a linguistic database of the Syriac language that can
    be used as a tool to implement search engines of Syriac texts.
    Central to the creation of a searchable Syriac text was an
    electronic lexicon compounded with a morphological generator.
    As Syriac is a highly inflected language, it is not possible to
    enumerate all of the Syriac words that may occur in texts.
    Kiraz proposed that a linguistically motivated lexicon be
    created, accompanied with a morphological generator that would
    create all, or as many as possible, inflected Syriac words, and
    named the project after the famous 10th century lexicographer
    Bar Bahlul.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P13"/>[13] The
    electronic lexicon was built in Access Format, and populated
    with roots and lexemes with many morphological attributes. The
    database contains abstract information from which a fuller
    lexicon can be generated using a morphological generator. The
    morphological generator is expressed in ASCII files according
    to a special format. In addition to deriving all verbal forms
    for each root based on information provided in the electronic
    lexicon, the morphological generator creates forms with object
    pronominal suffixes, possessive suffixes, and prefixes.<ref target="#FN20">20</ref>
         </p>
         <head xml:id="HV10N1Kiraz9">The Comprehensive Aramaic Lexicon</head>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P14"/>[14] In
    the 1980s, The Comprehensive Aramaic Project was born under the
    direction of Stephen Kaufman. The project is ambitious and aims
    at covering all dialects of ancient Aramaic. This is probably
    the first project involving Syriac wherein the lexical aspects
    of the project are primary, and concordance generation is
    secondary (i.e., concordance helps in compiling a lexicon).</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P15"/>[15]
    Various publications dealing with Aramaic dialects other than
    Syriac have already come out.<ref target="#FN21">21</ref> The publication of a
    concordance to the Old Syriac Gospels has just been
    published.<ref target="#FN22">22</ref> More information on CAL can be found on the
    project’s web site at <ref target="http://cal1.cn.huc.edu/">http://cal1.cn.huc.edu</ref>.</p>

         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P16"/>[16]
    Until the 1970s and even the early 1980s, publishing Syriac
    texts used traditional methods such as movable type, and
    machine-set types (e.g., the Syriac types produced in the 1920s
    by American Linotype, and the Estrangelo type produced by the
    British Monotype Corporation in 1954).<ref target="#FN23">23</ref>
         </p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P17"/>[17] With
    the advancement of computers, institutions began looking for
    ways to use computer technology to print Syriac texts. The
    first publications that employed computer technology for the
    production of the text were the concordances of the
    Göttinger Syrischen Konkordanz project mentioned above.
    The text was produced on a plotter, an output device that draws
    pictures and drawings using one or more pens, usually used by
    the engineering community for architectural drawings. This
    system was not used, to the best of my knowledge, beyond the
    project’s publications.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P18"/>[18]
    Another early project, one that made use of a more advanced
    technology, was initiated by the Assyrian Church of the East in
    the early 1980s. The Church’s Literary Committee
    commissioned Purdy and Macintosh to produce a high-resolution
    digital phototypesetting system. The term “digital”
    here needs to be qualified. The device, and the software that
    was implemented on the device, were indeed digital (i.e., a
    special-purpose computer). The actual output of the device,
    however, was a photographic one. This was advantageous at the
    time as photographic type produced better quality than digital
    type. The device’s photographic results were of the
    highest quality, at a resolution of up to 2602 elements per
    inch. In addition to Syriac, the device handled English and
    Arabic, catering for the need of the Church. The Syriac fonts
    were designed by the Church’s team and included one
    Estrangelo and one East Syriac type. The device was announced
    in 1985. The Church produced a beautiful lectionary using this
    system and a number of publications. Such devices proved to be
    quite expensive, which was a factor in their limited
    distribution. The general user had to wait until the
    popularization of personal computers, and the availability of
    Syriac digital types for these platforms.</p>
         <head xml:id="HV10N1Kiraz11">The DOS Era</head>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P19"/>[19] With
    the release of the IBM Personal Computer in the early 1980s,
    the age of personal computing really began. Individuals were
    able now to obtain such machines. By the mid 1980s, PCs were
    competing with the Apple Macintosh system, and to a lesser
    extent with the Atari system. This period witnessed a number of
    attempts by various individuals to implement Syriac fonts for
    various platforms. It is difficult here to give an account of
    all such efforts for the lack of documentation. Instead, I
    shall outline here my personal experience in developing Syriac
    fonts, mentioning the work of others when possible.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P20"/>[20] I
    began looking into the problem of Syriac fonts and word
    processing in 1984. My first attempts to represent a Syriac
    letter digitally revolved around hard-coding a representation
    of each glyph manually. I began by drawing an 8-column grid on
    a piece of paper. The choice of eight was because a byte, the
    unit of storing information in computers, consists of eight
    binary bits. I then drew the letter in the grid. For each row,
    a filled cell was assigned 1 and an empty was assigned 0, and
    these were then put together to form an 8-bit byte as shown in
    Figure 2. The collection of bytes (one per row) were then
    represented in the C programming language as an array; e.g.,
    the letter <hi rend="italic">Beth</hi> was represented as follows:</p>
         <p>int Beth[14] = { 0x00, 0x00, 0x3E, 0x41, 0x01, 0x0E, 0x00,
    0x00 };</p>
         <p>
            <graphic url="HV10N1Kiraz_02.jpg" rend="img" mimeType="image/jpeg"/>
         </p>
         <p>Figure 2. Crude binary
    representation of <hi rend="italic">beth</hi>. Binary numbers shown in black
    and red; hex numbers are shown in blue.</p>
         <p>This crude attempt produced ugly output. The lack of a word
    processor that would communicate with such a representation of
    fonts made the result useless.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P21"/>[21] In
    1985, I came across two products from a Colorado-based company
    called Data Transforms Inc.: Fontrix™ and
    Printrix™. The former product allowed the user to type
    text on a graphic screen using bitmap fonts. The input method
    allowed left-to-right as well as right-to-left writing. What
    made it interesting is that it came with a font editor that
    allowed the user to create new fonts. The Printrix product
    allowed the user to print larger documents avoiding the
    graphical screen. Fontrix and Printrix had a number of serious
    limitations. The font editor did not allow scanned images,
    forcing one to rely on manually drawn glyphs. Marks could not
    be placed above or below base glyphs. As the input was drawn on
    a graphical screen, one could not edit the text without having
    to delete it first. There was no text wrapping either. Despite
    these deficiencies, I produced a few crude fonts for private
    use as shown in Figure 3. Independently, Touma Issa produced a
    Syriac font in Fontrix with the help of his father Corepiscopos
    Butros Touma, and used it to print church banners in 1986.</p>

    1986 Gamma Productions of California issued version 3.0 of its
    multi-lingual word processor Multi-Lingual Scholar™
    (MLS). This software was truly multi-lingual in the sense that
    if the user was typing in a particular language, the
    typographical rules of that language applied. Indeed, it
    remained for PC-based systems the only unchallenged
    multi-lingual word processor until very recently when Microsoft
    released its multi-lingual operating system Windows 2000. MLS
    came with Latin, Cyrillic, Greek, Hebrew, and Arabic, with the
    possibility of adding other languages. Its importance to Syriac
    resided in the fact that MLS came with a font editor that
    allowed the user to create new fonts, indeed, new languages.
    The font editor was able to read scanned images; hence, one was
    able to design high-quality fonts based on books published from
    metal types. The word processor worked bi-directionally. One
    was able to place up to three marks above and below a letter
    (ample for Syriac), and the font allowed for twenty such
    marks.</p>

    Alaph Beth Computer Systems, a company that I founded in 1986
    and was operational until the early 1990s, produced a suite of
    Syriac fonts for MLS. Two Estrangelo fonts, one similar to the
    Monotype design, and the other based on a type originally
    designed by W. Drugulin of Leipzig ca. 1880; one Serto font
    modeled after a type whose original design dates back to a type
    associated with the famous diplomat and printer of Arabic,
    Savary de Bréves, before 1614; and one East Syriac font,
    based on a type by Drugulin ca. 1880, designed with helpful
    comments from Mar Emanuel Emanuel of the Church of the
    East.<ref target="#FN24">24</ref>
         </p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P24"/>[24] MLS
    used the bitmap font technology; i.e., drawing glyphs by pixels
    similar to my early crude attempt but using a more
    sophisticated font editor. This meant that a font was designed
    for a specific point size; another size would require designing
    a new font (usually copying the old font and editing it).
    Additionally, as each printing device had a different
    resolution (i.e., printed a different number of pixels per
    inch), each font at each size had to be designed for various
    printer solutions. 300 dots-per-inch (dpi) laser printers, 240
    dpi 24-pin dot matrix printers, and 180 dpi 9-pin dot matrix
    printers in both draft and quad-density modes.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P25"/>[25] MLS
    had a number of shortcomings. Formatting commands had to be
    typed within the text. No file could be larger than 64K bytes,
    including formatting commands. This meant that a complicated
    document, such as my <hi rend="italic">Concordance to the Syriac New
    Testament</hi> (1990), could not be more than five or six pages
    long. The 4,640-page <hi rend="italic">Concordance</hi> had to be split into
    928 files, but MLS had the ability to link each document to a
    “previous” and “next” document,
    creating a chain of documents. (Luckily, I had my
    concordance-generation software create and link the 928 files
    so that with one print command I was able to print the entire
    text). While such limitations would be unacceptable to the
    modern computer user, the user of the 1980s was satisfied to
    have such a multi-lingual capability, with a high-resolution
    output.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P26"/>[26] The
    MLS Syriac fonts were used in a number of other scholarly

    books with these fonts. The fonts appear in journals, wedding
    invitations, and even tombstones! A screen shot appears in

    During the 1990s, users started shifting from the DOS-based
    operating system to the more user-friendly Windows operating
    system. At the time Microsoft had different language-based
    operating systems. A Middle East version supported
    right-to-left writing. During this period, a number of fonts
    were produced by various people. Fonts for the standard Windows
    operating system were limited as users had to type texts
    backward, or use a utility program that switched the text for
    them. Those designed for the Middle East Windows version worked
    perfectly. In essence, the font designers designed an Arabic
    font, replacing Arabic glyphs with their corresponding Syriac
    glyphs. There was one problem that was ingeniously overcome by
    the font designers: The letters <hi rend="italic">Sodhe</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Taw</hi>
    are right-joining in Syriac but their counterparts in Arabic
    are dual-joining. As the rules of joining letters was
    hard-coded in the operating system, the fonts used the Arabic
    <hi rend="italic">ta-marbuta</hi> position for <hi rend="italic">Taw</hi>, and a similar
    letter for <hi rend="italic">Sodhe</hi>. The font methodology of the time was
    using TrueType fonts. These were outline fonts rather than
    bitmaps. The font designer had to define the shape of a glyph
    in terms of Bezier curves using a user-friendly font tool. One
    design is good enough for all sizes and resolutions. The
    computer takes care of figuring out the size of the font. One
    popular font was <hi rend="italic">suryani2</hi> whose origins I do not
    know.</p>

    During this period, Yannis Haralambous designed Sabra,<ref target="#FN27">27</ref> a
    collection of outline fonts and macros for use in the
    T<hi style="vertical-align: sub">E</hi>X typesetting
    languages. The project was part of a wider activity under the
    auspices of the ScholarT<hi style="vertical-align: sub">E</hi>X project. The encoded text was
    processed by T<hi style="vertical-align: sub">E</hi>X—X<hi style="vertical-align: sub">E</hi>T, the bidirectional version of
    T<hi style="vertical-align: sub">E</hi>X. A preprocessor,
    written as a set of macros and directives, allowed the user to
    encode texts in a more user-friendly fashion. The Haralambous
    fonts included all scripts. His Serto script was the first to
    use fine ligatures based on manuscript tradition (e.g.,
    changing the angle of Gomal depending on if the following
    letter is Lomad, `E or otherwise). I am not aware of how many
    publications made use of this system. I used it to produce my

            <anchor corresp="P31"/>[31] By
    2000, Microsoft decided to collapse its different
    language-based operating systems into one, and hence
    multi-lingual computing took a new shape with the release of
    Windows 2000. Coupled with this, a consortium of companies
    proposed a new font format called OpenType. These would be
    TrueType fonts with additional information built into them.
    Whether a letter is right-joining or dual-joining would now be
    stored in the font (not hard coded in the operating system).
    The distance of a diacritical point can be defined per glyph
    and that also can be saved in the font. Ligatures, kerning and
    other typographical data can all be part of the font now. The
    font designer will no longer be at the mercy of the operating
    system (as long as the operating system renders OpenType
    technology properly).</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P32"/>[32] Paul
    Nelson, Sargon Hasso and I embarked on putting specifications
    for Syriac OpenType fonts, and the results were the fonts in
    the Meltho font package, available as a free download from
    <ref target="http://www.bethmardutho.org/">http://www.bethmardutho.org</ref>. Alas, we have never
    documented in detail the technical aspects of the Meltho fonts.
    OpenType technology brought Syriac font design to a new level,
    and it would be useful to document this not only for practical
    reasons, but also for historical purposes. In brief, the fonts
    contain rules that specify the position of each letter, the
    distance of each mark from each glyph, and many additional
    rules that fine-tune the appearance of fonts. For instance, a
    kerning rule will distance a final Nun from a Dolath if the Nun
    hits the Dolath as depicted in Figure 5. Other rules may
    elongate the line joining letters. Such fine-tuning rules may
    be specified using left and right context regular expressions.
    The rules are usually specified by the user graphically and may
    be compiled as finite-state machines.</p>

    only other sets of fonts I am aware of that were designed under
    this methodology were the East Syriac fonts by Dr. Isho Marcus
    and Rabi Daniel Benjamin. The former has been involved in font
    design for decades and in fact was instrumental in the Assyrian
    Church of the East system mentioned above. The latter comes
    from a family of printing tradition in Iraq.</p>

    Since the inception of computer science, standards have emerged
    to ensure compatibility in platforms and applications. This
    became more important with the ubiquitous usage of computers
    world wide. One such standard is Unicode, replacing the old
    ASCII standard for storing texts in computers.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P35"/>[35]
    Windows 2000 dictated that any supported script must be part of
    the Unicode standard. This led Paul Nelson, Sargon Hasso and I
    to embark on writing a detailed proposal for the Unicode
    Consortium.<ref target="#FN29">29</ref> The proposal was sent to a number of scholars,
    who also wrote recommendation letters to the Unicode
    Consortium.<ref target="#FN30">30</ref> The proposal was submitted to the Unicode
    Consortium on February 27, 1998 and a unanimous resolution was
    passed on that day to accept it. Syriac became officially part
    of Unicode 3.0 in 2000<ref target="#FN31">31</ref> and occupied the 0700-074F slots.
    The standard defined 14 punctuation marks, 29 letters (the 22
    letters, Garshuni letters, CPA Pe, a dotless Dalath/Rish, and a
    Yudh-He Yahweh ligature), and numerous diacritical marks and
    points. A new addition was the Syriac Abbreviation mark, a
    control letter that marks the beginning of an overstrike
    abbreviation mark.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P36"/>[36] In
    2002, Nicholas Sims-Williams and Michael Everson proposed the
    addition of six additional Syriac letters for use in Sogdian
    and Persian,<ref target="#FN32">32</ref> which were incorporated into Unicode 5.0 in
    2007.<ref target="#FN33">33</ref> Syriac letters used for Malayalam Garshuni

    There are other standards in which Syriac appears. For
    instance, the language name is now part of ISO 639 which
    provides codes for all languages. Syriac is assigned to
    “Sy” in the two-letter codes and “Syr”
    in the three-letter codes.</p>

    Giving a detailed history of web sites or listing known ones in
    chronological order—despite the short history—is
    not an easy task. Electronic archives of early versions of
    sites, even those that are still active, no longer exist, and
    their creators in most cases did not have a reason to keep a
    record. While this is somewhat harmless, it should alert us to
    the fact that today’s web site may not be there tomorrow.
    This becomes a serious problem in the case of content-based
    sites such as the soon-to-become-available eBethArké
    library. How do we guarantee that digitized forms of unique
    material (such as manuscripts and archives, as opposed to
    printed books) will be kept safe for generations to come?</p>

    proper web server, Touma Issa hosted the site on his personal
    Windows 3.1 desktop using special software called Windows httpd
    that allowed the computer to serve web pages. He had to keep
    the desktop turned on 24/7. The URL was on the Murdock

    After 1996 the number of scholarly and community based sites

    “Syriac” yields 1.7 million pages (compare with a
    search done in 2005 which resulted in 300,000 pages). Google
    now gives suggestions based on what users search. The top
    search strings that users utilize which begin with Syriac are:
    Syriac Orthodox Church, Syriac Orthodox, Syriac Church, Syriac

            <anchor corresp="P50"/>[50] An
    optical character recognition (OCR) system that can cope with
    the various Syriac scripts is a desideratum. It will help us
    scan hundreds of texts not as images, but as searchable texts.
    This will also open the way for text-tagging projects along the
    lines of similar projects for Greek and Latin. The field is
    lucky to have William Clocksin<ref target="#FN37">37</ref> who has been working in the
    past few years on such a system. It is hoped that soon a
    user-friendly application can be hosted online that will allow
    users to upload images of texts and download them in Unicode
    searchable and editable form.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P51"/>[51]
    Another desideratum is a general knowledge-base that embodies
    an encyclopedia in the traditional sense, but also would link
    to bibliographical and manuscript-catalog databases. To these
    one can add a book review database, and a colophon database.
    Imagine if in a simple search, one could find everything that
    was published on a Syriac author, a list of the author’s
    works, the manuscripts containing those works and their
    colophons! The design of such a system is not too difficult and
    can be achieved in a very short period of time. What is
    time-consuming is populating the database. In the absence of
    funding, one may have to resort to a Wikipedia type
    encyclopedia where the users populate the data themselves.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P52"/>[52] If
    one is allowed to dream, one can add another desideratum: a
    linguistic database of the language that would include a
    computational lexicon and a natural language engine. The data
    model behind the computational lexicon needs to cover not only
    typical fields that are found in paper-lexica (variant
    orthographies, dialectical variants, historical spellings,
    collocations, idiomatic phrases, etc.), but also grammatical,
    morphological and phonological data that give flexibility for
    future applications. For instance, there has been hardly any
    system in previous lexical projects that encodes phonological
    information, and while most would cater to morphological
    paradigms, probably none marks things like transitiveness. Of
    equal importance are semantic and thesaurus-type information.
    These would not only allow the user to search the lexicon based
    on concepts (rather than mere roots, lexemes or word forms),
    but also would allow the building of semantic relations and
    hierarchies.<ref target="#FN38">38</ref> Such a system would allow for writing
    applications to assist in the grammatical tagging of texts, and
    we might as well drop a spelling checker there.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P53"/>[53]
    Multi-media can also play a role in projects. One project that
    comes to mind is a comprehensive recording of the Beth Gazo
    melodies according to various traditions. Syriac Orthodox
    Resources and Beth Mardutho have already digitized the
    recordings of Patriarch Jacob III and a few others, but a
    larger enterprise is needed to create a comprehensive
    searchable database that makes use of audio and texts.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P54"/>[54] Each
    person probably has his or her own wish list. Would you like
    your iPod to display Syriac?</p>

         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P1"/>[1] The
    field of Syriac studies, which is undergoing such a period of
    growth at present, is much less highly developed than the
    general field of the study of Christianity in Late Antiquity.
    When one recalls that Patristics, itself, is much less highly
    developed than Classical Studies (a fully mature discipline),
    one realizes that students of Syriac have a very long way to go
    before they can enjoy the pleasure of turning to a shelf full
    of dependable resources covering the entire range of their
    interests. Much has been learned, but obtaining access to the
    fruits of this scholarship continues to be a major
    stumbling-block to the interested reader. Without the scholarly
    equipment enjoyed by those involved in other areas, students of
    Syriac must embark on arduous searches if they are to locate
    (or establish the absence of) earlier work on a topic that has
    engaged their attention. There is no standard source
    comprehensive enough to provide answers for common questions
    that arise with great regularity.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P2"/>[2]
    Sebastian Brock has done yeoman service in collecting
    bibliographical information on Syriac Studies, from which we
    have all benefited, but he can hardly be expected to perform
    all this labor on his own, and the increase of activity in
    Syriac Studies continues to make this burden heavier. Several
    new journals have been founded to publish studies relating to
    Syriac materials, theological and historical journals are
    showing an increased level of interest (still insufficient
    interest, to my mind) in including articles relating to Syriac
    subjects, and the publication of a number of books and
    monographs has made the field more widely recognized. Scholarly
    work involving Syriac, meanwhile, continues to be published
    around the world, often in sources that are difficult for many
    to obtain.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P3"/>[3] The
    bibliographical difficulties connected with the study of
    Ephraem are perhaps the most acute of those attached to any
    writer of Syriac. Ephraem the Syrian is the most widely known
    Syriac figure among scholars of related fields. Because of
    this, his works have drawn attention from a broad range of
    people, and so have begun to be studied by them in conjunction
    with other authors from other language traditions, as well as
    for their usefulness for scholars in related disciplines. This
    is a very desirable thing for which Syriac scholars have
    striven for many decades, but it means that articles relating
    to Ephraem appear now in journals where they would never before
    have been considered. Progress and increased recognition have
    meant that Ephraem Studies have become more difficult to
    follow.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P4"/>[4] Kees den
    Biesen has stepped into this difficult situation and offered a
    volume which will certainly become a standard on the shelf and
    in the hands of every student of Ephraem the Syrian. Over the
    course of a number of years, at the cost of a great deal of
    labor, he has gathered information on the publication of
    editions of Ephraem in Syriac, on the ancient language
    translations, on the translations into modern languages, and on
    secondary works: articles and chapters in books, as well as
    scholarly monographs. The wealth of information contained in
    this book will make the study of Ephraem, and obtaining
    knowledge of what other scholars have done, much easier in the
    future.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P5"/>[5] The
    study of Ephraem the Syrian has a long and active history and
    the size of this volume reflects that. den Biesen lists no
    fewer than 1800 titles of various sorts in the main body of
    this work. In the first part of the volume, these 1800 titles
    have been organized by kind and topically into seven
    sections.  The first section offers references to
    treatments of Ephraem in the introductions to Patristic and
    Christian Theology, in encyclopedias, lexica and dictionaries,
    in manuals of Patrology, Theology and in the other earlier
    bibliographies. The second section in the numbering contains
    sources on Ephraem’s life, the texts and translations of
    them, as well as studies and biographies of the author. The
    third section includes a listing of editions of Ephraem’s
    works in Syriac in the main editions. Works of Ephraem in
    anthologies are also included. The fourth section covers the
    ancient language traditions. The fifth section deals with text
    editions, translations and studies of the various works of
    Ephraem. These subdivide into <hi rend="italic">Madrāšē</hi>,
    <hi rend="italic">Mēmrē</hi>, Commentaries on the Old Testament,
    Commentaries on the New Testament, prose works, Ephraem Graecus
    and Ephraem Latinus. The sixth section deals with secondary
    studies of the works of Ephraem arranged by topics. These
    topics include, but are not limited to: general studies of
    Ephraem, studies of his symbolic theology, theological
    hermeneutics, his poetry, his treatment of the Diatessaron and
    the text of the Bible, his exegesis of scripture, his
    Christology and Trinitarian doctrine, his theology of Paradise,
    his ideas of Christian life, his Mariology, his relations with
    the other religions of his time, and so on. (This choice of
    topics clearly reflects the trends in activity in the field.)
    The seventh section relates to translations of Ephraem’s
    works into modern languages. Some of these are: Arabic,
    Armenian, Dutch, English, French, German, Italian, Russian, and
    Swedish.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P6"/>[6] The
    second and major part of the book contains the references
    themselves, listed alphabetically by author or editor. 
    This part is also subdivided into sections: the first section
    deals with the editions of Ephraem, the second with
    “titles exclusively dealing with Ephrem”, the third
    with “titles partly dealing with Ephrem”, and the
    fourth with “titles incidentally dealing with
    Ephrem”. Six appendices list the contents of the various
    volumes in older, published editions of Ephraem works. These
    include Assemani's great Roman edition, Overbeck’s volume
    of Rabbula, Ephraem and Balai, and Lamy’s edition of
    Ephraem hymns and sermons, as well as others not so well known.
    These will be particularly useful for those of us who must
    order most of our material from libraries at other
    institutions.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P7"/>[7] den
    Biesen’s arrangement of his information allows the reader
    to search for works by the name of a particular scholar or by
    the topic the piece treats. For example, one can look for an
    edition of a particular hymn of Ephraem or to see what editions
    a particular scholar has produced.  One can also begin
    from the catalogue of Ephraem’s work and find, in the
    list of his collected or single works, mention of the various
    printed editions, of modern translations of the work and of
    secondary studies dealing with it.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P8"/>[8] One of
    the most useful elements in den Biesen’s work is that he
    has noted not only the translations of Ephraem published in
    separate volumes of collections of translated patristic works,
    but also in journal articles (including even partial
    translations of works).  This greatly increases the
    usefulness of this work and the accessibility of Ephraem for
    teachers and students.  It is now possible to discover,
    for example, if a particular one of the <hi rend="italic">Hymns on Fasting</hi>
    has been translated and where that translation may be
    found.  This is certain to make more young students and
    scholars innocent of Syriac able to include Ephraem in their
    work and reading. For an example chosen at random: on page 34,
    in reference to the “Hymns on Mary”, the volume
    lists Syriac texts edited by Brock, Lamy, Mingana and Rahmani;
    a Latin translation by Lamy; modern translations by Rahmani,
    Beck, Brock, Caraza, Ricciotti, Amann, Ortiz de Urbina and
    Starowiejski; and studies by Vona and Ortiz de Urbina, each
    with the title number it carries in the main listing.  (It
    is difficult to explain these categories to those who have not
    seen the volume, but the system is briefly explained by den
    Biesen on pages 17 and 18 and anyone with the volume in hand
    will quickly find his way through the arrangement.) Truly this
    is a mine of information!</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P9"/>[9] This is
    not the sort of book one reads, but I have made use of this
    volume over the several months since it came into my hands. I
    have found it to be, thus far, accurate and dependable in all
    the details of the entries I have used. Of course, a work like
    this is never finished, as the forward by Sebastian Brock
    reminds us, and the author has condemned himself to being the
    recipient of reminders and notices of works by Ephraem scholars
    for the rest of his life. Students of the work of Ephraem can
    only hope that his willingness to perform this labor for us has
    not been extinguished by the great effort involved in producing
    the volume and that he will continue to collect the notices,
    include them in his categories, and issue revised volumes
    periodically into the foreseeable future.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P10"/>[10] I do
    not think that any serious theological library, whether of an
    undergraduate college, university or seminary can allow this
    volume to be left out of its collection. Its usefulness is
    certain for students of Ephraem. I can only hope that
    specialists in the study of other Syriac authors will feel the
    challenge this volume silently offers and set themselves to
    work on producing companions to it, dedicated to other figures
    from the Syriac-speaking Church.</p>

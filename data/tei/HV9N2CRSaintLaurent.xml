         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P1"/>[1] In
    February, 2006, Dorushe, an international group of students of
    Syriac and affiliated with Beth Mardutho: Syriac Institute,
    sponsored a meeting for graduate students of Syriac
    Studies. The theme of the meeting was “Syriac
    Pedagogy,” and it took place at Catholic University of
    America.  Graduate student Ann Seville organized the
    event, and different students and professors from several
    countries presented papers. The faculty guest key-note speaker,
    Prof. Susan Ashbrook Harvey from Brown University, spoke to us
    about practical skills for Syriacists pursuing an academic
    career. She generously shared personal reflections and tips for
    the next generation of Syriac enthusiasts. She encouraged
    us to build strong networks amongst ourselves and to
    collaborate on projects and research questions. Other
    special guests included Profs. Sydney Griffith and Phillip
    Rousseau, and they kindly welcomed us to their center for Early
    Christian Studies and Semitics at Catholic
    University. Prof. Shawqi Talia, also from Catholic
    University, wrote for us a beautiful poem in Neo-Aramaic: a
    blessing for our academic efforts. Prof. Joel Walker from the
    University of Washington shared his comments and words of
    wisdom for professional development. George Kiraz spoke to us
    also about the latest in Computing Technology for our field and
    gave us a workshop on Meltho Fonts. Prof. Michael Sokoloff from
    Bar-Ilan University shared his recent work on the CAL and
    Brockelmann Syriac Dictionary project. The conference
    generated concrete plans for future development of our field
    and produced thoughtful reflection on the changes that Syriac
    Studies has seen in the last twenty-five years. Following
    is a summary of the papers that students and professors
    presented, with gratitude from the organizers for the
    stimulating dialogue that was generated.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P2"/>[2] David
    Michaelson, from Princeton University, presented a paper on
    “Developing a Syriac Database.”  He proposed
    that a Syriac database comparable to the <hi rend="italic">Thesaurus Lingue
    Grecae</hi> (TLG) could also be created for Syriac
    texts. He also suggested that an Electronic Bibliography
    of Syriac Studies could incorporate and compile current
    bibliographies on Syriac topics into one, and in this way it
    could easily be updated electronically. This electronic
    bibliography could also include a section on dissertations on
    Syriac topics. The group then discussed how to undertake such
    projects. We proposed that the best idea would be to divide the
    work amongst willing students who could then enter in the data
    manually. George Kiraz told us that it would be easiest if we
    commit to entering a little bit of information daily. Over
    the course of a year and divided up amongst a dedicated group,
    such a database could be achieved.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P3"/>[3] Michael
    Penn, professor of Religious Studies from Mount Holyoke College
    in Massachusetts, was unable to attend the conference. His
    paper, however, was read <hi rend="italic">in absentia</hi>. The topic,
    “Beyond Add and Stir: Teaching Syriac
    Christianity,” was an analysis that made suggestions
    concerning how one can integrate Syriac topics into
    introductory courses on Early Christianity. He offered
    some examples of syllabuses that he has used in his teaching to
    bring Syriac into “mainstream” courses on
    Christianity.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P4"/>[4] Jonathan
    Loopstra, a graduate student from Catholic University,
    presented a paper on integrating Syriac into Seminary
    Curricula. Jonathan focused particularly on the use of
    Electronic Resources such as <hi rend="italic">eBeth Arké,</hi> the
    Syriac Digital Library Project, and the International Syriac
    Language Project as a means of providing Syriacists with
    resources needed for smaller seminary settings. He
    suggested how digital media can facilitate the wider
    distribution of important Syriac texts and translations to
    colleagues and students.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P5"/>[5] Young
    Kim, a graduate student from the University of Michigan, shared
    his own personal narrative of what had led him into Syriac
    studies, and he explained how this incorporation of Syrian
    Christian history had enhanced his training in Late Antique
    Studies. This led to a discussion concerning the issue of
    the lack of Syriac teachers at many institutions of higher
    education.  We discussed places were Syriac can be
    learned, including Prof. Joseph Amar’s Summer Syriac
    Institute at the University of Notre Dame.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P6"/>[6] Linda
    Wheatley-Irvine, a professor from the University of Illinois,
    then ushered us into the field of Art History with her
    presentation on “Teaching Early Syriac Christianity with
    images and the Concept of Visuality.” We discussed the
    concept of the Visual Culture and how this notion fits well
    with the emphasis in Syrian Literature on sight. We saw
    also her beautiful images from Tur Abdin, and discussed the
    importance of better integration of art history and material
    culture into courses treating Christianity in the Syrian
    Orient.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P7"/>[7] Dan King
    from Cardiff University then spoke on the “Translation of
    Greek into Syriac: Models for Cultural Networking.” 
    Dan has been focusing on Translation Studies for his
    dissertation. He showed how the changing methods of
    translation technique in the West Syrian church reflect the
    ways they thought about theology and philosophy and interacted
    with all other cultural and historical developments, especially
    the relationship between the Greek and Syriac worlds. He argued
    that the translator was the “power-broker” in this
    situation, defining and regulating the attitudes of the
    faithful towards an alien culture and thereby to their own as
    well. He showed, moreover, how translation itself became
    part of the christological battle-ground in the early Syrian
    churches.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P8"/>[8] Ophir
    Münz-Manor, from Hebrew University in Jerusalem, spoke on
    the relationships of Syrian Christian Hymnography to Rabbinic
    Hymns: “From Ephrem to Yannai - The Rise of Late Antique
    Hymnography.” He discussed Ephrem’s hymnal
    structure and content, <hi rend="italic">madrashe</hi> and <hi rend="italic">memre</hi>, and he
    related them to Jewish counterparts by Yannai. This paper
    posed interesting questions on the mutual influence and
    dependency of these hymnographers.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P9"/>[9] Scott
    Girdner, a graduate student from Boston University, spoke on
    Christian-Muslim interaction in his paper: “The Potential
    for Syrian Orthodox Apologetic Literature in Presenting the
    Development of Mu‘tazilite <hi rend="italic">Kalām</hi>: The Debate
    of the Abbasid Caliph al-Mahdī and Timothy I in its
    context.” This talk raised methodological questions
    concerning the representation of Muslims in Syrian Christian
    Literature.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P10"/>[10]
    Conference attendants were also treated to a tour of a Syriac
    Exhibit in the Mullen Library, led by Semitics librarian Monica
    Blanchard. We also participated in a Syrian Orthodox prayer
    service on Sunday morning.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P11"/>[11] The
    success of the first Dorushe conference has encouraged us to
    make this an annual meeting.  David Michaelson of
    Princeton University has agreed to organize our next meeting
    the weekend of April 14, 2007. This will be held at Princeton
    University in New Jersey. Further information and an
    official announcement is forthcoming.</p>

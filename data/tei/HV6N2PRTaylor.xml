            <anchor corresp="P1"/>[1] This
    volume is a revised Ph.D. dissertation completed at the
    University of Cambridge in 1997 under the supervision of
    Geoffrey Khan. In it Williams analyzes selected features of the
    syntax of the Syriac text of 1 Kings, occasionally also making
    observations about the text-critical use of the Peshitta for
    the study of the Hebrew Bible. This is a study that is
    insightful, well organized, and carefully executed. It makes a
    very useful contribution to Peshitta studies, providing a
    thorough examination of the Syriac text of 1 Kings from the
    standpoint of syntax. Since Williams' focus is limited to a
    particular book of the Syriac Bible, his conclusions will need
    to be complemented by similar work in the rest of the Old
    Testament before being accepted as representative for the
    Peshitta in general.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P2"/>[2] Only one
    detailed study of the Peshitta of 1 Kings has previously
    appeared, that of J. Berlinger. Berlinger's work was
    text-critical in nature, dealing with the relationship of the
    Peshitta of 1 Kings to the Masoretic Hebrew text, the
    Septuagint, and the Targum. Interestingly, it was published in
    1897, exactly a century prior to the completion of Williams'
    dissertation. The appearance of this new study of 1 Kings is
    therefore welcome, since many advances have been made in Syriac
    scholarship over the past century since Berlinger's work
    appeared, the most obvious of which is the now nearly complete
    Leiden edition of the Peshitta. This critical edition provides
    a more solid footing for textual analysis than was possible in
    Berlinger's day.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P3"/>[3]
    Williams' monograph is organized into twelve chapters. In the
    first chapter the author surveys earlier work in the areas of
    Peshitta studies and Syriac syntax, particularly as they affect
    research in 1 Kings. He then takes up a study of the following
    areas of Peshitta syntax: the genitive; the use of "all"; the
    direct object; the conjunction "and"; the verb; speech
    formulae; infinitives; prepositions; demonstratives; and the
    word "behold." Williams explains his twofold rationale for
    selecting these areas as follows: either they are areas where
    his approach differs from that of other scholars, or they
    happen to be areas that have not received sufficient attention
    previously. A final chapter summarizes the author's
    conclusions. Throughout this volume the author regularly takes
    into account the syntactical contributions of the following
    five scholars: Th. Nöldeke, R. Duval, I. Avinery, T.
    Muraoka, and J. Joosten.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P4"/>[4] In what
    is perhaps a too brief introduction of only six pages Williams
    touches on some general matters related to study of the
    Peshitta and its syntax and translation technique. Here he
    agrees with the consensus of modern scholarship that the
    Peshitta is a primary version translated from a Hebrew
    <hi rend="italic">Vorlage</hi> that was quite close to the Masoretic text. He
    makes no suggestion as to whether this translation was
    originally made for a Jewish or a Christian community, and on
    the question of dating he goes no further than to suggest that
    the translation was made sometime in the first three centuries
    A.D. His comments on the purposes and history of syntactical
    research are also quite brief. To some extent this brevity is
    countered by his interaction with the secondary literature
    later in the book, but it would have been helpful to have a
    more thorough overview at the outset of the volume.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P5"/>[5] In a
    number of places Williams is able to correct certain
    syntactical conclusions drawn by earlier scholars. For example,
    he shows that Avinery's conclusion that the three constructions
    used in Syriac for the genitive relationship mark degrees of
    definiteness is not actually borne out by the evidence in 1
    Kings. Instead, a variety of other factors are involved in
    determining which of these constructions is used. He also shows
    that Nöldeke's view that degrees of determination are
    reflected in the several structures in Syriac for indicating
    direct objects is inadequate, at least in the case of 1 Kings.
    He also questions Avinery's view, based on a preference to
    express direct objects by the structure <hi rend="italic">verb + object suffix
    / l + nominal</hi>, that the Syriac translator of Exodus was
    different from the translator(s) of the rest of the Pentateuch.
    According to Williams, this choice is due instead to the high
    incidence in Exodus of descriptions of the making of cult
    furniture. It should not therefore be used as evidence for a
    different translator.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P6"/>[6] Williams
    also shows that the citation of the Peshitta in the apparatus
    of <hi rend="italic">BHS</hi> is at times inconsistent and even misleading,
    particularly in citations related to the presence or absence of
    the conjunction. Since in many such cases the use or non-use of
    "and" is based entirely on the requirements of Syriac style and
    has nothing to do with textual variation in the Syriac
    <hi rend="italic">Vorlage</hi>, textual critics should evaluate such readings
    at a deeper level than that of surface only.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P7"/>[7] Williams
    is also able to show that variation in the use of verb tenses
    in the Syriac translation as compared to those in the Hebrew
    text is often due not to textual causes but to Syriac idiom. In
    discussing the Peshitta verb forms in their relation to the
    Hebrew verbs of its <hi rend="italic">Vorlage</hi> Williams makes the
    interesting suggestion that the Peshitta may be helpful for
    understanding the meaning of the <hi rend="italic">wayyiqtol</hi> form in
    Hebrew, since this form was understood to be very different
    from the Syriac <hi rend="italic">waqtal</hi> form (p. 116). This is a hunch
    that deserves to be followed up in future grammatical research,
    even though it is possible that the translators may not have
    fully grasped the significance of this form.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P8"/>[8]
    Williams' conclusions on word order, particularly in speech
    formulae, demonstrate why caution is needed before suggesting
    that variation in word order is necessarily due to textual
    disturbance. The problem here is that while the Peshitta often
    imitates the word order of the Hebrew text, it equally often
    adjusts the word order to fit Syriac style. Likewise, the
    choice of prepositions is usually determined not by slavish
    imitation of the Hebrew, but by what is appropriate for Syriac
    idiom (cf. 165). In two instances (i.e., 1 Kings 8:29; 8:59)
    Williams finds puzzling the fact that the Peshitta reverses the
    order of the Hebrew terms found in a matched pair (p. 155).
    However, this reversal seems to be in keeping with a tendency
    that can be observed elsewhere in the Peshitta. I have
    documented numerous instances of this translation technique in
    the Book of Daniel. Other scholars have noticed a similar
    tendency in certain other books of the Peshitta as well.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P9"/>[9]
    Williams' general conclusion for the syntax of the Peshitta of
    1 Kings is that it is "a remarkably consistent translation"
    when consistency is defined not in terms of its Hebrew
    <hi rend="italic">Vorlage</hi> but in terms of the idiom of the Syriac language
    itself (p. 183). Although it follows the proto-Masoretic text
    closely, the Peshitta goes its own way whenever such departure
    is necessary for maintaining the naturalness of the Syriac
    idiom. In other words, the Peshitta "sets a higher premium on
    semantic rather than formal equivalence" (p. 184). This
    conclusion is consistent with what investigators have
    determined for other parts of the Peshitta as well.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P10"/>[10] The
    attention that has been given to the Peshitta over the last
    half-century or so is a welcome change to the pattern of
    neglect that prevailed previously. Much of this attention in
    recent decades has focused on text-critical concerns. Williams'
    attention to the area of syntax for a particular Old Testament
    book is a significant departure in a new direction, and the
    quantity of data that he has collected to support his
    conclusions makes this an important volume. What is still
    needed are similar works devoted to the remaining books of the
    Syriac Bible. Once that has been done in a comprehensive way,
    we will be in a better position to refine and in some cases
    correct the great grammatical tools created by generations of
    earlier scholars who in terms of available resources worked
    under less advantageous conditions.</p>

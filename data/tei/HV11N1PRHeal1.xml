         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P1"/>[1] Students
    of Syriac literature are once again indebted to Jerome Lund for
    providing an extremely useful <hi rend="italic">instrument de travail</hi>.
    Following on the heels of his concordance of the <hi rend="italic">Old Syriac
    Gospels</hi> (2004, <ref target="../Vol9No2/HV9N2PRTaylor1.html">reviewed</ref> by David G. K.
    Taylor in <ref target="../Vol9No2/index.html">
               <hi rend="italic">Hugoye</hi>
    9.2</ref>), this slim volume breaks new ground by being the first
    key-word-in-context (KWIC) concordance of a non-biblical Syriac
    text. Of course, we have the valuable word lists for the works
    published in the three <hi rend="italic">Patrologia Syriaca</hi> volumes (a
    pattern that carried over into some of the early Patrologia
    Orientalis fascicles), as well as the indices that accompany
    the editions of the industrious Werner Strothmann, but up until
    now we have no actual concordances for Syriac literary
    texts.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P2"/>[2] The
    primary value of a KWIC concordance is the convenient manner in
    which it allows one to explore and examine the language of a
    given text. Whether one wants to describe the linguistic
    complexion of a text, or to simply identify whether a certain
    word appears within that text, the first tool that one would
    chose is a concordance. At least this has been the case up
    until recently. Now, with the growth of the digital humanities,
    one often has the choice between a traditional concordance or
    an electronically searchable corpus. This is certainly the case
    for those working in biblical studies, or with the Dead Sea
    Scrolls, to name only two fields benefiting from both
    traditional concordances and searchable electronic corpora. It
    is also the case, moreover, for those scholars working with
    Bardaisan’s <hi rend="italic">Book of the Laws of the Countries</hi>,
    since the concordance under review “finds its origin in
    the database of the Comprehensive Aramaic Lexicon [CAL]
    directed by Dr. Stephen A. Kaufman” (vii).</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P3"/>[3] Though
    there is a genetic relationship between the CAL database and
    Lund’s concordance, the two resources are far from
    identical, or even equally useful. Lund has clearly done a lot
    of work with the data he obtained from CAL before presenting it
    for publication. He has imposed a rational order on his
    material, separating out personal (233-34) and geographic names
    (235-36), for example. Also, the creation of a concordance has
    obviously provided numerous opportunities to check and correct
    the data. Thus, many of the glosses in the concordance are
    improved over those provided on CAL’s KWIC Search, and a
    number of entries have been refined or corrected. Most
    importantly to this reviewer, however, are the substantial
    aesthetic advances made by the concordance. It is simply easier
    and more pleasant to find information in the concordance than
    through CAL’s database, at least as presently
    constituted. One can easily locate a lemma in the concordance,
    and quickly see the forms in which that lemma appears in the
    text, where it appears in the printed edition (by page and line
    number), and in what context.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P4"/>[4] It seems
    to this reviewer that Lund’s concordance should find a
    welcome home in every good university library, and will be
    coveted by all scholars working with early Syriac
    literature.</p>

                <div xml:lang="en">
                <p xml:lang="en">Most modern scholarship on the medieval Middle East bases
                    itself on the writings of elite scholars in the region’s major religious
                    traditions, authors who were generally focused on elaborating complex
                    systems of theology and ideology. In this book, Tannous argues that the
                    implicit world created by centering such sources neglects the
                    overwhelming demographic reality of the period: that Middle Easterners
                    were largely illiterate, largely agrarian “simple believers” (Syr. <hi
                        rend="italic">hedyoṭē</hi>; Ar. <hi rend="italic">ʿawāmm</hi>).
                    Remembering this population—and accounting for its halting, incomplete
                    transformation from the sixth to the eleventh centuries<note
                        place="foot" xml:id="ftn1" n="1"><p rend="footnote text"> The
                            titular and <hi rend="italic">passim</hi> division of this
                            period into ‘medieval’ and ‘late antique’ feels somewhat in
                            tension with the book’s attention to the continuities of these
                            two eras. See now Thomas Bauer, <hi rend="italic">Warum es kein
                                islamisches Mittelalter gab: Das Erbe der Antike und der
                                Orient</hi> (Munich: C. H. Beck, 2018), who prefers the
                            phrase “die islamische Spätantike.”</p></note>—requires a
                    historiographic turn towards a bottom-up history of the “lived religious
                    experience of all the region’s inhabitants” (p. 8).</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">The book consists of four parts. The first, “Simple
                    Belief,” asks a pointed question: “Did the society of the late antique
                    Middle East resemble something like an advanced seminar in patristic
                    theology” (p. 15)? The obvious (negative) answer reminds us that the
                    interconfessional rivalry often foregrounded in the historiography of
                    Christian late antiquity would not have been legible to many of the
                    inhabitants of that world. Accounting for this “layering of knowledge”
                    (p. 57), theological elites competed for the allegiance of simple
                    Christians through an anxious mix of doctrinal compromise and
                    pragmatism. </p>
                <p xml:lang="en">The second part, “Consequences of Chalcedon,”
                    considers some of the ramifications of the haziness of late antique
                    confessional identity. The discussion of the Canons of Jacob of Edessa
                    in Ch. 3 is a particularly vivid example of a learned churchman’s
                    difficulties policing confessional boundaries, inchoate boundaries that
                    he himself was engaged in drawing. Church leaders used a broad arsenal
                    of tools in the campaign to sway simple believers to their version of
                    orthodoxy, including debate and “theological streetfighters” (Ch. 4);
                    the sacraments, especially the Eucharist (Ch. 5); and education,
                    particularly secondary schooling in scholastic centers (Chs. 6 &amp; 7).
                    All of this was an attempt by the various confessions to create
                    “marginal differentiation” (p. 197), an advertising concept that Tannous
                    adopts to denote the strategies used by similar groups to stand out in a
                    crowded landscape of competitors. </p>
                <p xml:lang="en">Building on this approach, Part III (“Christians
                    and Muslims”) applies a similar analysis to the rise of the early
                    Islamic community. A religiously heterodox, under-catechized society was
                    the <hi rend="italic">Sitz im Leben</hi> for the Qurʾān, which is “a
                    reflection of and reaction to Christianity as it existed on the ground
                    in the seventh-century Ḥijāz” (p. 252). This account is not entirely
                    convincing. For all the merits of reframing the Qurʾān as a document in
                    conversation with simple believers, I wish more attention were paid to
                    the text’s own complex and confrontational theology, its nuanced
                    intertextuality with Syriac homiletic and liturgical works, and the
                    importance of Jews in Muḥammad’s community—in Tannous’ terms, to the
                    layering of knowledge within the seventh-century Ḥijāzī population.
                    Indeed, the Qurʾān is perhaps our best document for the theological
                    sophistication possible on the peripheries of the late antique
                    oecumene.</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">Whatever its roots, Tannous argues that the
                    ideology of earliest Islam, less developed than contemporaneous forms of
                    Christianity,<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn2" n="2"><p
                        rend="footnote text"> This is put rather starkly: “If Christian
                        orthodoxy in the seventh century can be compared to a perfectly
                        executed performance of a piece by Chopin (or Beethoven or
                        Mozart, depending on the Christian group), then we can hardly
                        say that Islamic orthodoxy even had a score in the same period”
                        (p. 261). More useful is J. E. Brockopp’s notion of Muslim
                        “proto-scholars”: see his <hi rend="italic">Muhammad’s Heirs:
                            The Rise of Muslim Scholarly Communities, 622–950</hi>
                        (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2017).</p></note> was
                    not the reason for the political success of the nascent Muslim
                    community. Most people in the lands of the early Islamic empire(s) would
                    have been ignorant as to the specific propositional contents of
                    Muḥammad’s message (Ch. 10), and conversion was driven more often by
                    temporal concerns than by matters of religious conviction (Ch. 11).
                    Moreover, the process of conversion was slow: Tannous asserts that
                    Muslims were a numerical minority in the Middle East “at least until the
                    Mamluk period” (p. 340). </p>
                <p xml:lang="en">The consequences of this religious inertia were
                    profound. Lived Christianity was a fact of daily life for almost all
                    medieval Middle Easterners, particularly in more rural areas. And much
                    like the Christian elite, Muslim scholars’ anxiety over the reality of
                    nebulous communal boundaries resulted in a raft of measures to try to
                    create in practice the separation that the theologians articulated in
                    theory. Such efforts, taken together with innumerable continuities
                    between pre-Islamic and Islamic practices (Ch. 8 &amp; pp. 419–428),
                    indicate the ways in which the Middle East changed Islam, rather than
                    the more frequently interrogated effects of Islam on the Middle East.
                    Such a viewpoint historicizes Islam as a process, one linked intimately
                    to the large groups of simple Christian believers who peopled much of
                    region. </p>
                <p xml:lang="en">In the final part (“The Making of the Medieval
                    Middle East”), Tannous examines some of the most important loci for
                    Muslim-Christian connections: religiously heterogeneous families, daily
                    interactions, monasteries, festivals, converts (and the traditions they
                    brought with them), and prisoners of war (Ch. 14). He concludes (Ch. 15)
                    with a challenge to modern scholarship: can we let go of the idea that
                    the rise of Islam represented a “mass ideological change,” abandoning
                    the “sectarian” conception of medieval Middle Eastern history as Arab
                    Muslim history? And in so doing, could we do greater justice to what
                    life, particularly ordinary life, was like? Lastly, there is a very
                    useful appendix on Tannous’ approach to the sources and the problem of
                    authenticity.</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">Despite, and perhaps because of, the scope of the
                    book, there are topics the reader wishes received more attention. I will
                    limit myself to two points. First, Egypt. Albeit Tannous states that he
                    will focus mostly on “Syria, Palestine, and Iraq,” (p. 7), given the
                    book’s ambitious title a more thorough account of Egypt would have been
                    welcome. Egyptian evidence, though contradictory, complicates the book’s
                    argument for a slow Islamization lasting until the rise of the Mamluks
                    in the 13<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> century.<note place="foot"

                    affiliation (to the point of maintaining a registry of converts and
                    branding the hands of monks to control their movement).<note

                    wishes more use were made of the documentary wealth of Egyptian papyri
                    as an unequalled window into the daily lives of Christians and Muslims
                    alike.</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">Second, Tannous’ meticulous analysis of the textual
                    sources of both the Syriac and Arabic traditions is unfortunately not
                    turned to the panoply of relevant material evidence from the period.
                    Apart from passing references, the physical record receives short
                    shrift. Given the inevitable difficulties of recovering ordinary voices
                    from elite sources, this is a significant oversight. Tombstones,
                    graffiti, textiles, ceramics, images, coins, and the like all offer a
                    unique perspective on discourses of religious identification.<note

                            from Tannous’ extensive bibliography. David Frankfurter’s <hi
                                rend="italic">Christianizing Egypt: Syncretism and Local
                                Worlds in Late Antiquity</hi> (Princeton: Princeton
                            University Press, 2018) is a useful companion read demonstrating
                            the value of such sources.</p></note> The inclusion of such
                    objects within Tannous’ analysis would have brought it closer to the
                    communities it seeks to describe.</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">These suggestions aside,
                    <hi rend="italic">The Making of the Medieval Middle East </hi>offers
                    an eloquent and provocative corrective for traditional histories wherein
                    “the experience of a great deal of the region’s population is relegated
                    to a bit part and minor role in the telling of the region’s story, or
                    simply falls through the cracks” (p. 499). This is a tour de force of
                    scholarship, meticulously researched but also approachably lively. Our
                    understanding of the complex lives of the late antique and early
                    medieval worlds is much richer for its having been written.</p>

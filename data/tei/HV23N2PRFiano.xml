				<p> This volume collects papers originally presented at an international congress
					held in Rome in 2011, on the topic of “paths of knowledge” in the
					Syro-Mesopotamian world between the third and ninth centuries. The eighteen
					contributions are preceded by a Preface and by an Introduction which helpfully
					groups them thematically (p. 12; though with the mistaken mention of an author
					not present in the book and the omission of another one who is). In this brief
					review I will limit myself to a minimal summary of all the essays. </p>
				<p> Paolo Bettiolo’s “Le scuole nella Chiesa siro-orientale: <hi rend="italic"
						>status quaestionis</hi> e prospettive della ricerca” (pp. 17–46) focuses on
					the East Syrian scholastic model (late fifth to eighth centuries). The author
					sets up a typology of exegetical-theological schools, examines the link
					connecting them to Christian elites and to East Syriac monastic learning, and
					highlights the role of Theodore of Mopsuestia in their training. In “Storia di
					Roma – storia di Antiochia: la storiografia romana tardoantica riflette una
					prospettiva antiochena?” (pp. 47–58), Susanna Elm discusses the Antiochene
					setting of the writings of the fourth-century historians Eutropius and Festus in
					relation to their treatment of Rome’s expansionism toward Persia at the time of
					Julian and Jovian. Elm suggests that those authors’ cautious attitude toward the
					Roman campaign may reflect an Antiochene perspective on the events. Elisabetta
					Abate, in her “Le catene della tradizione nella <hi rend="italic">Mišnah</hi>”
					(pp. 59–73), compares four passages of this Jewish compilation that articulate
					the “chain of transmission” of religious knowledge, adding an excursus about the
					institutional structure of the rabbinic movement. </p>
				<p> Aryeh Kofsky, in “Theology and Hermeneutics among Syriac Christianity, Greek
					Christianity and Contemporaneous Judaism (4<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>–5<hi
						rend="superscript">th</hi> Centuries): Paradigms of Interaction” (pp. 75–
						<pb n="427"/> 90), surveys the Christological views of Aphrahat and Ephrem.
					Kofsky interrogates “the influence of early Syriac Christianity on Greek Syrian
					Christianity and, further, on the school of Antioch” (p. 84), paying particular
					attention to those two authors’ “low anthropology and Christology” (p. 87). René
					Roux’s “Sapere teologico e sapere profano all’inizio del VI secolo: l’esperienza
					di Severo di Antiochia a Beirut” (pp. 91–103) describes Severus’s sojourn in
					Beirut (from 487 to 492) and his early contacts with Christian theology,
					dwelling especially on the influence of his study of Roman law upon his
					theological method. In “Libanius’ <hi rend="italic">Pro Templis</hi> and the Art
					of Seeing Syria through Rhetoric” (pp. 105–114), Edward Watts offers a reading
					of Libanius’s proposals for ending religious violence in <hi rend="italic"
						>Oration 30</hi> that emphasizes the limited sway the rhetorician held in
					Antioch at that time. Gerrit Jan Reinink, in “The School of Seleucia and the
					Heritage of Nisibis, the ‘Mother of Sciences’ ” (pp. 115–131), argues that it
					was the arrival of Mar Aba at Seleucia and the appointment of Ishai—both were
					students of Abraham of Bet Rabban, a teacher at the School of Nisibis—that
					propelled academic activities in the Sasanian capital. </p>
				<p> “Poesia e conoscenza nei <hi rend="italic">madrāšē</hi> di Efrem: fra Nisibi e
					dintorni” (pp. 133–148), by Emidio Vergani, explores among other things the
					metaphors used by Ephrem to refer to knowledge, as well as the limitations the
					Syriac theologian placed upon knowledge as a tool in the path toward salvation.
					In “Provvidenza, libertà e legame anima-corpo nella lettera 2 di Timoteo I a
					Rabban Boḵẖtīšōʿ, archiatra di Hārūn al-Rašīd” (pp. 149–175), Vittorio Berti
					investigates the contribution of theology and philosophy to medical science
					through a letter by Timothy I, patriarch of the Church of the East. Sabino
					Chialà, in “Lettura e cultura negli ambienti monastici siro-orientali” (pp.
					177–190), shows, based on both hagiographical and canonical evidence, that while
					reading was generally held in high esteem in the East Syriac monastic milieus, a
					contrary tendency may be noticed in the sixth-century spiritual reform of
					Abraham of Kashkar and in his followers. Chialà also analyzes <pb n="428"/> the
					course of studies completed by Rabban Bar ʿEdta at the Great Monastery of Mount
					Izla, as presented in his <hi rend="italic">Vita</hi>. Marco Demichelis, in
					“Baṣra, Cradle of Islamic Culture: An Analysis of the Urban Area that Was the
					Early Home of Islamic Studies” (pp. 191–220), details the political and cultural
					factors that led this city to become an even greater center of Islamic
					intellectual production than the capital Damascus. </p>
				<p> In “Biblical Predictions of the Prophet Muḥammad among the Zaydīs of Yemen (6<hi
						rend="superscript">th</hi>/12<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> and 7<hi
						rend="superscript">th</hi>/13<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> centuries)” (pp.
					221–240), Sabine Schmidtke calls attention to the links between different
					Yemenite Zaydi theologians’ treatments of biblical prophecies about the advent
					of the Prophet. Her treatment, which starts with the twelfth-century scholar
					Ḥusām al-Dīn al-Ḥasan b. Muḥammad al-Raṣṣāṣ, integrates untranslated passages of
					the authors’ treatises. David Thomas, in “Explanations of Christian Doctrines in
					the World of Early Islam” (pp. 241–252), provides an overview of
					Christian-Muslim theological dialogue in the early centuries of Islam. The
					author emphasizes the lack of mutual understanding between the two communities
					and shows how attempts at dialogue rapidly devolved into the exchange of
					formalized arguments, without any true engagement. Carmela Baffioni’s “Il
					‘computo delle proposizioni’ nel MS Esad Effendi 3638 e la tradizione
					siro-araba” (pp. 253–278) examines an anonymous text, titled <hi rend="italic"
						>On the Composition of the Premises</hi> and appended to the epistle about
					Aristotle’s <hi rend="italic">On Interpretation (Letter 12)</hi> composed by the
					Ikhwān al-Ṣafā (Brethren of Purity). Baffioni provides a translation of the <hi
						rend="italic">Composition</hi> (pp. 257–278) and explores various links to
					the Syriac and Arabic philosophical traditions. In “The Cross¬ing Paths of Greek
					and Persian Knowledge in the 9th-Century Arabic ‘Book of Degrees’” (pp.
					279–303), Alexandre M. Roberts provides an introduction to, and summary of, an
					unpublished treatise of genethlialogical astrology (i.e., astrology related to
					the fate of a newborn). Roberts indicates that the work presents itself as an
					heir to ancient Greek wisdom while being terminologically indebted to Sasanian
					culture (a culture <pb n="429"/> that, he argues, played an important role in the
					eighth- through tenth-century Greek-to-Arabic translation movement). </p>
				<p> With her “Teaching the Hearts: Rābi‘a al-‘Adawiya’s Role in the Spiritual
					Formation of the Intellectual Élite in Al-Baṣra, II Century of the Hegira”
					(pp. 305–319), Shirine Dakouri offers a portrait of a prominent eighth-century
					Sufi mystic, pondering the religious significance of her womanhood and the role
					of the “female element” (p. 305) in Sufism. The last two contributions, by
					editors Carla Noce and Claudia Tavolieri, are both devoted to the role of music
					in the third- through fifth-century education of women in Roman Syria. The two
					essays, which were conceived jointly, carry identical titles but different
					subtitles. Noce’s “Una vita tra silenzio e canto: alcune considerazioni sul
					ruolo svolto dalla musica nella formazione religiosa delle donne cristiane in
					ambito siro-occidentale” (pp. 321–349) discusses the dialectic between women’s
					silence and pious singing found in ancient Christian sources (rooted in biblical
					and Graeco-Roman traditions). Noce also re-reads the dossier of Paul of
					Samosata, identifying Antioch as a place where tensions between ecclesiastical
					factions revolved also around the use of liturgy and the role played in it by
					women. Claudia Tavolieri, in “Una vita tra silenzio e canto: l’importanza
					dell’educazione musicale delle donne in alcuni esempi tratti dalla letteratura
					siriaca” (pp. 351–373), tackles the interplay of music and female education by
					sampling Syriac works such as Ephrem’s <hi rend="italic">madrashe</hi>, the <hi
						rend="italic">Acts of Thomas</hi>, and the <hi rend="italic">Vita</hi> of
					Abraham of Qidun, additionally establishing connections with Christianity’s Old
					Testament background. In spite of occasional editorial oddities (some
					contributions contain a bibliography while others do not, and one lone
					contribution is followed by an abstract) and of some heterogeneity in the
					authors’ styles of presentation and academic modes, the collection holds
					together quite nicely. As a whole, the volume is successful in directing the
					reader’s attention to the forms, institutions, and avenues for the transmission
					of knowledge within and across the diverse religious and linguistic cultures of
					the Syro-Mesopotamian region. </p>

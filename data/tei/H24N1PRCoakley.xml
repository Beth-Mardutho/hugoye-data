                <p xml:lang="en">Ishoʿdad of Merw’s commentaries on the New Testament gospels
                    were edited and translated into English by Margaret D. Gibson and published
                    in three volumes in a generous format by Cambridge University Press in 1911.
                    This work is well known and respected, and one’s first question on seeing
                    the present new edition of the commentary on John is why it should be
                    needed. The editor Johan D. Hofstra explains this in his introduction (text
                    vol., pp. xiii–xv) under three heads. First, new Syriac texts have been
                    published since 1911, in particular some that are possible sources for
                    Ishoʿdad’s work. Secondly, the text of the commentaries is known from more
                    manuscripts now than in 1911, while Mrs. Gibson (for all her “enormous
                    achievement”) made mistakes in collating the manuscripts she did have.
                    Thirdly, her translation is not always “accessible”; that is, it does not
                    always make clear the meaning of the Syriac. We can consider these points in
                    reverse order here. </p>
                <p xml:lang="en">Mrs. Gibson’s translation of Ishoʿdad is on the whole
                    correct word by word, and Hofstra has done well to follow, as he most often
                    does, her choice of English equivalents. Frequently enough, however,
                    Ishoʿdad’s meaning eluded her, and Hofstra has found it, or at least come
                    closer to it. To take one example, on John 1.14, Ishoʿdad comments on the
                    phrase “glory as of the Only-begotten”:</p>
                <p rend="H Quote Block">This addition and position of <hi rend="italic"
                    >dolath</hi> (“of”) is suitable … for from what he says on the one hand
                    without addition; He has taught us one nature and person, of <hi
                        rend="italic">the Word</hi> and of His
                    <hi rend="italic">flesh… </hi>(Gibson). </p>
                <p rend="H Quote Block">And he (the evangelist) said it (very) well with the
                    addition, that “dalat”… If now, instead of it, he had spoken without
                    addition, he would be teaching us one nature and hypostasis of “the Word”
                    and of his “flesh” (Hofstra).
                </p>
                <p xml:lang="en">Hofstra’s translation rightly captures the commentator’s
                    christological aversion, typical of East Syrian authors, to “one nature” or
                    “one hypostasis (<hi rend="italic">qnoma</hi>)” in Christ. </p>
                <p xml:lang="en">Occasionally, the reader may wonder if Ishoʿdad’s
                    compressed comments have still been elusive. On the enigmatic 153 fish in
                    John 21.11, Hofstra translates: </p>
                <p rend="H Quote Block">Origen (says) it symbolizes the Holy Trinity. By the
                    fifties and the three it symbolizes also the Psalms of David, a hundred and
                    fifty in number; and by the three (it symbolizes) the three praises which
                    they add to the Psalms from the Law and the Prophets.</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">This does not quite catch the Syriac. “By the fifties and the
                    three” is part of Origen’s alleged Trinitarian explanation: 153 = <hi
                        rend="underline">3</hi> x 50 + <hi rend="underline">3</hi>. And the
                    Psalms are 153 including the 3 odes (<foreign xml:lang="syr"
                        >ܬܫܒ̈ܚܬܐ</foreign>, not “praises”) that are added in the liturgical
                    Psalter. (Ishoʿdad usually stays away from allegorizing details of the
                    gospel story, although a similar comment to this one comes on John 19.23
                    where he quotes Ephrem on the treatment of Jesus’s garments by the
                    soldiers.) </p>
                <p xml:lang="en">Hofstra lists and describes fifteen manuscripts,
                    including the three which Mrs. Gibson had used. His detailed descriptions
                    leave nothing to be desired, recording scribal characteristics, and counting
                    and listing variant readings large and small. Most readers will probably
                    take the details as read and skip to the <hi rend="italic">stemma
                        codicum</hi> (p. lxix) which, although not a strict stemma, organizes
                    the manuscripts into families. Following this classification, the editor
                    chooses five as his “base manuscripts” (p. lxxxv). The choice is not clearly
                    explained, but seems to rest on the others, in particular those that derive
                    from Alqosh, reflecting a revised text. In any case, the base manuscripts
                    include the two oldest codices, Berlin 81 (1490) and Saint Petersburg Syr.
                    33 (16th cent. in its older part), neither of which was accessible to Mrs.
                    Gibson in 1911.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn1" n="1"><p
                        rend="footnote text"> But she used them in her later volumes, on
                        Acts and the catholic epistles (1913) and the Pauline epistles
                        (1916). Photographs of the Petersburg ms. (borrowed and photographed
                        in Cambridge!) is now Cambridge University Library ms. Or. 1750.
                        Photographs of the Berlin ms. are likewise in the archives of
                        Westminster College, Cambridge, WGL2/2.</p></note> But they also
                    include ms. Harvard Syriac 131 (formerly Harris 130) on which she based her
                    edition; and this means that Hofstra’s text is not very different from hers.
                    All the same, among the tabulations in his introduction I wish there were
                    one that pointed out the places, or at least the important ones, where his
                    text does differ from Mrs. Gibson’s. (The long table of “errata in Gibson’s
                    edition” on pp. lxx–lxxxiv does not do this, but only lists readings where
                    she misread one or other of her manuscripts, something that hardly seems
                    worth recording now.) Although the text may not be a major issue for the
                    whole commentary, there are occasions where the translation can be
                    significantly affected by variants in the principal manuscripts. When
                    Caiaphas pronounces that it is better for one man to die for the people than
                    that the whole nation should perish (John 11.50), was it Ishoʿdad’s view
                    that he spoke by the gift of the Holy Spirit (Hofstra), or not (Gibson)? At
                    the last supper (on John 13.18), does Jesus eat the passover with his
                    disciples (Gibson) or does he only eat by himself after them (Hofstra)? In
                    these two cases, it is a question whether to read <foreign xml:lang="syr"
                        >ܠܘ</foreign> “not” with some of the manuscripts. In the same passage
                    (on v. 27), did Judas go out (<foreign xml:lang="syr">ܐܙܝܠ</foreign>,
                    Hofstra) to bring in the Jews, or was he moved (<foreign xml:lang="syr"
                        >ܐܙܝܥ</foreign>, Gibson) to do so? Hofstra may be right, on the textual
                    evidence and even on the sense of the passages, to correct Gibson; but these
                    matters are arguable, and there ought to be footnotes in the translation to
                    call attention to the alternative possibilities. </p>
                <p xml:lang="en">It may be in place to comment here in passing on the
                    sentence-punctuation and diacritical pointing of Hofstra’s Syriac text. He
                    says (p. lxxxv), “The edition generally follows the punctuation of the base
                    manuscripts.” But this rule, even if strictly applied, does not prescribe
                    the punctuation where these six manuscripts differ. Editors are generally
                    allowed some freedom here;<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn2" n="2"><p
                        rend="footnote text"> The received wisdom of R. Draguet is that for
                        any text, even one edited from a single manuscript, the editor may
                        impose “une ponctuation normalisé.” See his “Une méthode d’édition
                        des textes syriaques” in <hi rend="italic">A Tribute to Arthur
                            Vööbus</hi>, ed. R. H. Fischer (Chicago 1977), 13–18, specif.
                        15–16.</p></note> but I found that Hofstra often chose punctuation
                    that was unnecessarily against the grain of the translation.<note
                        place="foot" xml:id="ftn3" n="3"><p rend="footnote text"> Reading is
                            also not helped by the punctuation in Peeters’s Syriac font, which
                            has become curiously tiny. The single and double points ought to be,
                            as they were in past publications, of the same boldness as the
                            letters. </p></note> With diacritical marks, the text “retains the
                    points meant to distinguish homographs and the points used to distinguish
                    perfect tense verbs from participles.” It is no fault of Hofstra’s that
                    there is no set of such points that is accepted by all editors, but there
                    would be no harm in being more liberal with these, especially since
                    vocalized East Syriac manuscripts make the choices clear. Such pairs as
                    <foreign xml:lang="syr">ܗ̇ܢܘܢ</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="syr"
                        >ܗ</foreign>̣<foreign xml:lang="syr">ܢܘܢ</foreign> should at any rate
                    always be included.</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">It is in the investigation of the sources that Ishoʿdad
                    used for his commentary on John that Hofstra makes his most valuable
                    contribution. His discussion occupies most (pp. xx–lxxii) of his
                    introduction to the translation volume. Mrs. Gibson’s translation had
                    pointed out only occasional contacts with Ephrem on the Diatessaron. J. R.
                    Harris in his introduction remarked on the much more important contribution
                    of Theodore of Mopsuestia, whose commentary on John is available to us, as
                    it was to Ishoʿdad, in Syriac; but it seems this came as an afterthought to
                    her.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn4" n="4"><p rend="footnote text"> She
                        gives a table, without comment, on 221 “coincidences” between
                        Ishoʿdad and Theodore.</p></note> This contribution is now
                    thoroughly explored by Hofstra. It amounts by his reckoning to no less than
                    40% of the text of Ishoʿdad. Each of 371 instances of dependence on Theodore
                    is recorded in the footnotes to the translation. A similar treatment is
                    given to John Chrysostom, Gregory of Nazianzen, and Ephrem, Ishoʿdad’s other
                    three considerable (although far less so than Theodore) patristic sources.
                    This analysis facilitates the translation of many obscure passages in
                    Ishoʿdad. An example is his elaborate discussion of John 5.19ff. (“the Son
                    can do nothing … but only what he sees the Father doing”) where he comments,
                    “Are there four worlds then?” – that is, the two, present and future, that
                    the Father creates, and two more that would be created by the Son if we
                    supposed the Son did all that the Father did. The line of reasoning comes
                    from Gregory of Nazianzen, and it is explained clearly by Hofstra’s footnote
                    – only leaving one wondering how many readers of Ishoʿdad would ever have
                    understood his comment without this context. </p>
                <p xml:lang="en">Hofstra also considers Ishoʿdad‘s dependence on writers
                    in his own East Syriac tradition. He joins a long-running discussion on this
                    subject, and concludes, carefully, that Ishoʿdad used the works of both
                    Ishoʿ bar Nun and Theodore bar Koni directly; and among other occasional
                    sources, also the letters of Catholicos Timothy. Only notably missing in his
                    list of sources is Henana, whose commentaries were certainly known to
                    Ishoʿdad but who is not cited by him on John at all. It is possible that
                    some comments by this ambiguous figure may be concealed under the name of
                    the “Theophoroi” or the “Tradition of the School” of Nisibis; but since
                    Henana is repeatedly cited by Ishoʿdad on Matthew, it may be either that his
                    commentary on John was lost early on, or simply that his exegetical work
                    never extended to this gospel.</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">Hofstra’s detailed and painstaking volumes will
                    supersede Mrs. Gibson’s as the edition of choice for anyone using the work
                    of Ishoʿdad on John. This is particularly so with respect to the text,
                    although the reader may need to be alive to the apparatus for the sake of
                    variant readings not signalled in the translation. For the translation
                    itself, it may still be helpful sometimes to compare Mrs. Gibson. But for
                    the identification and analysis of Ishoʿdad’s sources, readers have now been
                    well served as never before.</p>

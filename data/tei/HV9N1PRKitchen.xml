    Trinitarian theology has been on the rise, with all manner of
    studies and theologies being offered befitting the complexity
    and subtlety of One God in Three Persons, the unique Christian
    concept in world religion. This contribution by Eugene F.
    Rogers, Jr., professor of religious studies at the University
    of North Carolina at Greensboro, while a very important one for
    anyone interested in the Third Person, would not fall normally
    within the scope of topics to be reviewed by this
    journal. Rogers, however, is eager to draw the
    perspectives of Eastern—and Syriac—Christianity
    into his field of vision.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P2"/>[2] Waiting
    on final proofs from the publisher of his previous book, Rogers
    found he had plenty of time to delve into works on the Spirit
    in translations from the Eastern traditions. In
    particular, Rogers really loves Ephrem, citing numerous hymns,
    and one section of the seventh hymn on the Virginity is cited
    three times in the volume. Many other Syriac authors make
    an appearance in Roger’s investigations: Balai, Bar
    Hebraeus, Jacob of Serug, Isaac of Nineveh, Philoxenus of
    Mabbug, Abdisho bar Berikha. Greek writers such as Gregory
    of Nyssa, Gregory Nazianzen, Athanasius and Cyril of
    Alexandria, Maximus the Confessor, and Romanos the Melodist,
    along with significant forays into the thought of Russian
    Orthodox theologians Pavel Florensky, Sergei Bulgakov, and Paul
    Evdokimov are not the usual fare for a Western
    systematic/constructive theologian.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P3"/>[3] Is this
    not the purpose for which all labors at translation have been
    intended: to provide other theologians and historians reliable
    source materials for their work? Rogers utilizes well the
    materials and assessments of other scholars. His favorite
    source is Sebastian Brock’s The <hi rend="italic">Holy Spirit in Syrian
    Baptismal Tradition</hi> (Poona, India: Anita Printers, 1998)
    from which the lion’s share of his Syriac citations are
    drawn.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P4"/>[4] One of
    Rogers’ other Eastern favorites is the life of Simeon
    Stylites, but it is the life as interpreted in several articles
    by Susan Ashbrook Harvey upon which he focuses. Admitting
    that he is making an atypical scholarly move, Rogers relies not
    upon the actual <hi rend="italic">vitas</hi> of Simeon, but upon
    Harvey’s secondary study [primarily “The
    Stylite’s Liturgy: Ritual and Religious Identity in Late
    Antiquity,” <hi rend="italic">Journal of Early Christian Studies</hi> 6
    (1998) 523-539], which shall be examined below.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P5"/>[5]
    Nevertheless, Rogers’ monograph is still firmly planted
    in the West. Despite the numerous Eastern (“outside
    the Modern West”) references, Augustine and Thomas
    Aquinas provide critical mass for the theology of the Spirit,
    while Robert Jenson, Donald Mackinnon, and Rowan Williams help
    guide Rogers in the thinking of the modern West. Behind
    all the scenes remains the presence of Karl Barth. Although
    Rogers firmly corrects Barth on several key points in the
    latter’s understanding of the Holy Spirit, it is apparent
    that Barth still provides the orientation for much of
    Rogers’ direction.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P6"/>[6] In the
    midst of his sabbatical reading, Rogers came to recognize that
    the Person of the Spirit has usually been neglected,
    sublimated, disembodied, and consequently depersonalized in
    modern trinitarian theological systems. He begins with
    Barth who, while appearing to be the champion of the Spirit, is
    one of the culprits for its subtle demise. Paraphrasing
    the famous line from the musical <hi rend="italic">Annie Oakley</hi>, Rogers
    captures the sense of Barth’s approach, “Anything
    the Spirit can do, the Son can do better!” Barth
    talks about the importance of the Spirit, but over the pages of
    <hi rend="italic">Church Dogmatics</hi> his Christocentric tendency nudges
    him to assign the real work of the Spirit to that of the
    Son. His language sometimes speaks of the Spirit being
    “the power of Christ,” reducing the Person to a
    function. Rogers concludes, “In the background,
    Barth is both the model and disappointment here.”</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P7"/>[7] Rogers
    sets out fourteen “Preliminary Theses,” providing
    the outline of his argument. Several can be helpful for us
    here. The second and third theses direct us to the New
    Testament witnesses that permit us to glimpse the
    intratrinitarian relations and interactions of the
    Persons. We are allowed such glimpses through the agency
    of the Spirit which then manifests these relations “in
    human beings as the conditions for the possibility of human
    participation in the trinitarian life.” The life of
    the Trinity is not just an idea about which we think and
    contemplate, but a reality in which human beings can and do
    take part.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P8"/>[8]
    Rogers’ essential summary of this interrelationship is in
    his fifth thesis: “The Spirit proceeds from the Father to
    rest on the Son.” He prefers the more active verb
    “to alight” rather than the passive “to
    rest.” The idea is filled out in the following sixth
    thesis: “Because the Spirit hovers over the waters at
    creation and rests on the body of the Son in the incarnation,
    the Spirit rests on bodies in excess of nature, or
    ‘paraphysically,’ to coin a word out of Romans
    11:24; not just in a way that re-befriends the physical, but
    also in a way that redeems, transfigures, elevates, and exceeds
    it.” For Rogers, it is the non-necessity, the
    excessiveness, superfluity, the grace and rest that
    characterizes and distinguishes the Spirit as a Person of the
    Trinity.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P9"/>[9] From
    here Rogers takes the reader on a rich, but complex tour
    amplifying the nature, character and adventures of the
    Spirit. Each section warrants time to savor and digest, so
    it is not a simple task to summarize all the insights and
    arguments elucidated. Yet it is possible to summarize the
    narrative of Rogers’ understanding of the Spirit, and
    narrative is the word.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P10"/>[10]
    “I propose that the Spirit is a Person with an affinity
    for material things. The Spirit characteristically
    befriends the body,” declares Rogers. The Spirit is
    therefore not just a function or power of the other
    Persons. A Person requires a narrative, a vita, and
    despite the perspective of some readers, there are plenty of
    narratives of and about the Spirit in the Old and New
    Testament. Rogers acknowledges that many of these
    instances involve the Spirit acting in concert with the Son, so
    he uses these primary narratives to frame his development of
    the Third Person: Resurrection, Annunciation, Baptism,
    Transfiguration, and Ascension/Pentecost.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P11"/>[11] The
    Spirit is often perceived as being inaccessible in a personal
    human sense, but Rogers objects that this is “not because
    she <hi rend="italic">lacks</hi> the qualities of a person; the Spirit is
    inaccessible because she <hi rend="italic">has</hi> the qualities of a
    person. She is not inaccessible because
    <hi rend="italic">im</hi>personal, but <hi rend="italic">as</hi> personal.” Who,
    after all, can really say that one knows completely another
    person with all our inner mysteries? It is the
    superfluity, the excessiveness of the gifts of the Spirit, that
    most marks the character of the Spirit; an
    excessiveness—what else is grace but excessive?—by
    which human beings are saved. So in the end the Spirit can
    do something better than the Son - rest.  “The logic
    of the Spirit is not of productivity, but of superfluity, not
    the logic of work, but of Sabbath. The Spirit like the
    Sabbath sanctifies.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P12"/>[12] A
    few notes on Rogers’ journey through the narratives of
    the Spirit.</p>
         <p>Resurrection: “The most remarkable trinitarian passage
    in the New Testament,” Robert Jenson observes, is Romans
    8:11—“If the Spirit of the One Who raised Christ
    Jesus from the dead dwells in your mortal bodies, you too shall
    rise from the dead.” Rogers peers inside the verse
    through several other exegetes and early writers, but his most
    important insight comes via Aquinas. “Nevertheless
    something is to be gained by Christ’s reception of the
    resurrection from the Father: The <hi rend="italic">exercise</hi> of raw
    power is not joinable, because unlike Christ human beings do
    not have that power as their <hi rend="italic">proprium</hi>; but the
    <hi rend="italic">reception</hi> of power is joinable, ‘because what
    God the Father did in Christ, he does also in
    us.’” Human beings become perfect, deified,
    not in their accomplishment, but in their reception of the
    Spirit’s gift.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P13"/>[13]
    Annunciation: The concept of the Spirit’s superfluity and
    excessiveness is perceived especially in Mary’s giving
    birth to Christ. One of Romanos the Melodist’s hymns on
    the Nativity utilizes the key phrase “<hi rend="italic">para
    phusin</hi>” that Rogers interprets as “excess of
    nature,” as opposed to many translators who render the
    phrase, “contrary to nature.” He rightly notes
    that it is this excessiveness of the virgin birth that some
    Protestants don’t like and feel uncomfortable about, for
    it is just too exorbitant, out of control, physically excessive
    (Rogers is Presbyterian). The last word on this excessive
    Annunciation Rogers gives to Jacob of Serug, “Mary gave a
    body for the Word to become incarnate, while Baptism gives the
    Spirit for human beings to be renewed.”(P. Bedjan,
    <hi rend="italic">Homiliae selectae</hi>, Vol. 1, <hi rend="italic">mēmrā</hi> 9,
    p. 204)</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P14"/>[14]
    Baptism: What happens at the River Jordan is to be primarily
    understood as an intratrinitarian event, in which other human
    beings may participate by their own baptism. The general
    problem of why did Jesus need to be baptized is answered by
    observing that while the Son does enjoy a divine attribute by
    right, there is no barrier to his receiving it also from
    another (the Spirit) in humility. This ability to receive
    from the Spirit also enables Christ to receive even from human
    beings. The Spirit relates to the Son by taking
    “something Christ does not need and presents it to him as
    gift,” while “Christ does not hold on to what is
    his but receives it from another as gift.”</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P15"/>[15]
    Rogers is enamored with Ephrem’s seventh hymn on
    Virginity [strophes 5, 6, and 14 are selected], placing it as
    his epigraph to the volume, examining it at the conclusion of
    Part I, and again here. The hymn identifies the oil used
    to anoint the baptized as “the dear friend of the Holy
    Spirit,” the oil painting the image of Christ onto the
    one baptized. “Christ has many facets, and the oil
    acts as a mirror to them all: from whatever angle I look at the
    oil, Christ looks out at me from it.” Human
    participation in baptism leads one back towards participation
    in the divine. Rogers cites Vladimir Lossky’s
    succinct observation, “The work of the Son deifies human
    nature, and the work of the Spirit deifies the human
    person.”</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P16"/>[16]
    Transfiguration: Rogers pulls together Romans 8 and
    Luke’s depiction of the Transfiguration to imply that
    only God can pray to God. When human beings pray they are
    caught up in the triune activity of the Persons praying to one
    another. Prayer is what the Trinity does. Prayer does
    not “change God’s mind,” but is a
    transfiguration of human beings who do not know how to pray as
    they ought.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P17"/>[17] It
    is in liturgy that human beings are nourished and developed by
    the Spirit over time. Rogers turns to the life of Simeon
    Stylites as an example of how asceticism can be liturgically
    channeled to a positive end for both ascetic and
    community. Simeon’s <hi rend="italic">vitas</hi> witness how
    Simeon’s out of control severe asceticism caused
    continual dissension in his community, resulting inevitably in
    his expulsion. The local priest Mar Bas takes on Simeon
    and encourages both his athletic asceticism, pillar and all, as
    well as structuring his practices around the eucharist, the
    daily and annual liturgical calendar, preaching and teaching,
    healing and reconciling disputes. Rogers relays
    Harvey’s assessment that “Simeon began his
    pillar-standing as an attempt to escape people, but was
    transformed into the very center of liturgical life.... His
    body becomes spiritual, anticipating the spiritual bodies of
    heaven, taking on characteristics associated with the Holy
    Spirit—light, fire, incense, presence on the altar,
    formation of the seeker, production of the witness, gathering
    of the community.” Rogers concludes that Simeon,
    under his own authority was pathological, out of control, and
    therefore amorphous, while under the liturgical formation of
    the Spirit, he is unique and original not as an individual but
    to and for his fellows.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P18"/>[18]
    Ascension and Pentecost:  Rogers recognizes the problem in
    his re-construction of the narrative of the Spirit is that
    Pentecost does not take place in the life of Jesus, nor does
    the Ascension mention the Spirit. Yet, Rogers sees the two
    events forming an excellent example of how the Son defers to
    the Spirit in order to receive a gift.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P19"/>[19] It
    would be quibbling for <hi rend="italic">Hugoye</hi> readers with their
    special interests to require more of Rogers in utilizing the
    resources of the Eastern and Syriac churches, though it is true
    that many of his Syriac references are branches to his
    argument, not the roots. His constructive pneumatology is
    just that: a systematic endeavor to understand the Person of
    the Spirit in her intertrinitarian activities. I believe,
    nevertheless, that Rogers is part of a beneficent trend slowly
    developing in Western theological ranks that recognizes and
    utilizes the contributions and insights of Eastern Christian
    and Syriac theology and literature. Predictably, Ephrem is
    the writer most often selected. Jaroslav Pelikan, Hughes
    Oliphant Old, Robert Wilken, Carol Zaleski, and certainly
    others, have referenced Ephrem and other Syriac writers in
    recent writings with no pretensions to Syriac scholarship
    <hi rend="italic">per se</hi>, just pretensions to good theology. The
    more non-specialists in Syriac literature read these works in
    translation, the more we will learn in return. As Rogers
    would probably assent, there is ample roominess in the Spirit
    to accommodate all manner of readers of resources outside the
    modern West.</p>

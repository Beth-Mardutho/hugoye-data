         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P1"/>[1] This
    book is a revised edition of the author's <hi rend="italic">The Nestorians and
    their Muslim Neighbors</hi>, which was published in 1961. <hi rend="italic">The
    Nestorians</hi> was the first book devoted to the Modern
    Assyrians since A.J. Maclean and W.H. Browne's <hi rend="italic">The
    Catholicos of the East and his People</hi> (1892); it was full
    of information; and it had a sizable bibliography. All these
    facts quickly made it a standard work of reference, although,
    being published in a quiet scholarly series, it can only have
    had modest sales. Copies were anyhow scarce: twenty years ago
    the present reviewer had the experience of waiting in a queue
    for what was, apparently, the only one available on
    inter-library loan in Britain.</p>
         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P2"/>[2]
    Curiously, while the book was in demand from us ecclesiastical
    historians, it escaped the notice of other scholars. The
    explanation for this fact seems to lie in the library world.
    Cataloguers at the Library of Congress assign subject-headings
    when they make a record for a new publication, choosing from a
    fixed list. The list was (and still is) quite inadequate to
    deal with the Syriac churches and the ethnic groups
    historically represented by them. Even so, the list in force in
    1961 did contain the heading 'Assyrians', glossed as follows:
    'Here are entered works dealing with the modern adherents of
    the Nestorian Church as an element in the populations of both
    Asiatic Turkey and Iraq.'<ref target="#FN1">1</ref> While this is not a particularly
    good or clear definition, the heading fitted the book and ought
    to have been used. Perhaps the cataloguer took his cue from
    Joseph's own rejection of the name 'Assyrians'. In any case, he
    used instead only the heading 'Nestorians - history', which was
    not only dislikable in itself, but also far from the vocabulary
    of the modern Middle East. So in 1974-5 when the
    <hi rend="italic">International Journal of Middle East Studies</hi> published
    an article entitled 'The Assyrian affair of 1933', it was clear
    that neither the author (K. S. Husry) nor the journal's
    referees were aware of Joseph's book where the episode was
    fully treated, using some different sources. (Joseph published
    a useful reply to Husry later in the same journal.) Clearly
    <hi rend="italic">The Nestorians and their Muslim Neighbors</hi> deserved a
    re-issue with a new title. This we now have, and <hi rend="italic">The Modern
    Assyrians of the Middle East</hi> is in fact something better, a
    significantly revised edition. It is only sad to notice on the
    verso of the title page the new Library of Congress record with
    only the same subject-heading 'Nestorians - history'.
    Fortunately, one can now search library catalogues by keywords
    in the title!</p>
         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P3"/>[3] The new
    title deserves a moment's further notice. Besides catching the
    attention of a wider scholarly audience, perhaps it will also
    look more attractive to readers from the Assyrian community, by
    many of whom Joseph has been considered a renegade all these
    years because of the anti-'Assyrian' views found in the old
    edition. In his new Preface, Joseph expresses the hope that
    Assyrians will read the book - and may it be so. Enthusiasts
    for ancient Assyria will, however, find nothing to conciliate
    them. Once past the title page, the name 'Assyrians' is hardly
    used again until near the end of the book. Not only that, but
    the first chapter has been expanded into a full-scale
    engagement with those writers, almost all of whom are members
    of the community, who insist on the identification of the
    modern Assyrians with the ancient people of that name. Joseph's
    discussion is now the most comprehensive one on this subject,
    subsuming the classic article of J.-M. Fiey ('"Assyriens" ou
    "aram√©ens"?', 1965; Fiey was among those who did not know
    Joseph's work at the time).</p>
         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P4"/>[4] After
    the discussion of terminology and ethnography, we come to a
    sequence of chapters taking the history of the Modern Assyrians
    from late antiquity (briefly and under the odd title 'Early
    beginnings') to the present day. The chapters are slightly
    reorganized from the earlier edition and there is new
    documentation throughout, but the substance, except for what is
    new at the end, will be familiar to readers of the first
    edition. Here I shall not try to comb over this old ground, but
    I offer the following three remarks as a quick orientation for
    the new reader.</p>
         <p>1. I said above that Joseph's book is better known by
    ecclesiastical than by secular historians. Yet it is on
    diplomatic and political matters that Joseph is at his best,
    for example on the delicate legal status of the Assyrians under
    the Ottoman regime (pp. 59-60), and the complex unfolding of
    the Mosul question in 1921-5 (pp. 166-85). I wish we had the
    benefit of his analysis of the supposed promise made by a
    British officer to the Assyrians in 1918 that they would have
    their own homeland after the war; but this incident, which is
    still very important in the memory of the community, is only
    indirectly mentioned (pp. 146, 155).</p>
         <p>2. With matters religious, ecclesiastical and missionary,
    Joseph is less comfortable. The reader who is told that 'after
    the Council of Ephesus, those who adhered to the teachings of
    Nestorius organized their own church' which was subsequently
    'forced to move in the direction of Mesopotamia and Persia' (p.
    41, a statement admittedly at variance with most of the rest of
    the chapter) will naturally be somewhat wary of the treatment
    of ecclesiastical matters later on in the book. It is also an
    ominous sign that having banished the name 'Nestorian' from the
    title, the author retains it elsewhere in the book, even in the
    chapters covering the period after 1918 when it clearly
    includes people other than members of the Church of the East.
    For all that it may be a handy term, no theologically sensitive
    writer could do this.</p>
         <p>3. The treatment of missions in particular, which makes up a
    substantial part of the book, is a classic. The Assyrians were
    'previously untroubled by the kind of religious prejudices and
    conflicts that were set into motion' by the missions (p. 88);
    these missions were the agents of 'the political and cultural
    imperialism of the "Christian" powers' (p. 69); the
    missionaries did harm by 'refusing to recognize any truth or
    values in Nestorian beliefs and practices' (p. 95); and the
    'unseemly struggle' among the different missions was a scandal
    (p. 133). Praise for the missionaries is limited, more or less,
    to their role in the relief of suffering during World War I
    (p.140). This whole position, in my opinion, needs some
    correction. Briefly: most of the de-racinating and
    de-stabilizing attributable to the missions would have come
    anyway in the twentieth century, and they would have been worse
    if the missions had not prepared the Assyrians to meet the
    modern world. But it is not so much at that point where I would
    fault Joseph (and others). It is rather that he is hardly
    interested in the <hi rend="italic">primary</hi>, religious work of the
    missions (there are no tabulations of parishes, schools, books
    printed, etc. - they would be dull, to be sure), but only in
    the secondary, social and political, effects of this work.
    Those scholars, on the other hand, who put in long hours in
    missionary archives reading reports of the day-to-day
    activities of missionaries, do not usually emerge with the
    censorious judgment given by Joseph. Is that just because we
    become comfortable and sympathetic with the people whose
    correspondence we are reading? Or is it that something is being
    neglected by the others? In my opinion, the reader should keep
    in brackets the more general statements that Joseph makes about
    missions to the Assyrians until we have, for example, a more
    comprehensive history of the American ABCFM/Presbyterian
    mission than anything presently available.</p>
         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P5"/>[5] The last
    two chapters (9 'Between mutually hostile neighbors' and 10
    'From missions to ecumenism') are substantially new in this
    edition. These chapters do not very easily come under the
    subtitle 'encounters with Western Christian missions,
    archaeologists, and colonial powers', but they are certainly
    valuable, having a good deal of material that is not readily
    available elsewhere. Ch. 9 includes an account of the recent
    history of the Kurds, with whose affairs the Assyrians are now
    so closely connected. (The Assyrian party in Kurdistan is
    Zo<hi rend="sup">
               <hi rend="small">c</hi>
            </hi>a
    (<hi rend="italic">zaw<hi rend="sup">
                  <hi rend="small">c</hi>
               </hi>a</hi> 'movement'), not Zo'a.)
    But these chapters are selective too, and if the idea is to
    bring the history of the Assyrians down to date there should be
    something more than the occasional sentence about Assyrians in
    the diaspora, and something about modern Assyrian literature
    and culture. Ch. 10 has a discussion of the exercise of
    'rethinking missions' that has gone on in postcolonial times,
    and a section entitled 'The Roman Catholic Church and Islam',
    neither of which is particularly relevant to the Assyrians. The
    second half of the chapter takes the history of the Church of
    the East from its low point in the 1930s to the important
    doctrinal agreement of 1998 with the Roman Catholic Church,
    which serves as a sort of happy ending to the whole study.</p>
         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P6"/>[6] The
    bibliography has been greatly expanded, although some of the
    new entries are not very helpful, e.g. books on the remote
    biblical background and on religious pluralism, and many
    encyclopedia articles. Macuch's <hi rend="italic">Geschichte der sp√§t- und
    neusyrischen Literatur</hi> (1976) appears, but nothing in
    modern Syriac has been added to the few titles in the first
    edition, not even Jacob bar Malek Ismael, <hi rend="italic">The Assyrians and
    the Two World Wars</hi> (Tehran 1964); nor anything significant
    in Arabic since 1961. German readers will be surprised not to
    see P. Kawerau, <hi rend="italic">Amerika und die orientalishen Kirchen</hi>
    (1957) or any of the books of Gabriele Yonan, especially
    <hi rend="italic">Assyrer heute</hi> (1978), or the articles of Martin Tamcke.
    The useful book of John Guest on the Yezidis, <hi rend="italic">Survival among
    the Kurds</hi> (2nd ed. 1993) is also an omission.</p>
         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P7"/>[7] John
    Joseph's last book <hi rend="italic">Muslim-Christian relations and
    inter-Christian rivalries in the Middle East: the case of the
    Jacobites in an age of transition</hi> (State University of New
    York Press, 1983) was unpleasantly marred by the absence of
    copy-editing, and I hoped that the obvious remedies would have
    been applied to this one. Alas, they have not been, and the
    number of errors in spelling, grammar, punctuation, etc., is
    well above what should ever be associated with the names of
    John Joseph and E. J. Brill.</p>
         <p rend="n">
            <anchor xml:id="P8"/>[8] To sum
    up: Joseph's <hi rend="italic">Modern Assyrians</hi> is not a book that
    displaces others, but it is welcome and valuable alike to those
    who have, and those who have not, used the earlier edition. It
    is still the best discussion of the political history of the
    Modern Assyrians and still the richest bibliographical guide to
    the subject, its discussion of the international politics after
    World War I is particularly thorough, and it is absolutely
    required reading for anyone wishing to understand the debate
    over the identity of the 'Assyrians'.</p>_______<lb/>

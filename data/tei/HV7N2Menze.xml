            <p>The Eucharist formed the visible boundary
    between Chalcedonians and non-Chalcedonians in the fifth and
    sixth centuries. Non-Chalcedonian texts emphasize the
    difference of the Eucharists, but this does not necessarily
    imply that it was a widely accepted view. This paper analyzes
    the understanding of the Eucharist among parish priests and the

    of the non-Chalcedonians and that communion forms the visible
    boundary between Chalcedonians and non-Chalcedonians. Taking
    the Eucharist from the hands of an "orthodox"—i.e., a
    non-Chalcedonian—priest is part of practicing the right

            <anchor corresp="P3"/>[3] However,
    these texts reflect only how the clergy, especially the
    bishops, wanted to present the sacrament of the Eucharist to
    the laity, not what the supposed recipients thought of it. It
    may be therefore worthwhile to circumvent the idealized image
    of the Eucharist that hagiographic texts present by analyzing
    the interactions of the average non-Chalcedonian layperson with
    his (parish) priest. The local priest represented the church,
    and what he taught the laity would certainly shape their
    understanding of the Eucharist.<note place="foot" xml:id="#FN7" n="7">

             Although certainly very influential on a local
    level, village priests are not well represented in the sources.
    As R.I. Moore, <hi rend="italic">The first European Revolution, c.
    970-1215</hi> (Blackwell: Oxford, c2000), 60 rightly states for
    the village priest in Europe: "At most periods in European
    history the parish priest is a figure as poorly documented as
    he is obviously influential."

            <anchor corresp="P5"/>[5] Some
    villages did not have a priest at all who could instruct the
    laity about the importance of the Eucharist. In that case, the
    canons ruled that the deacon should take the offerings from the
    villagers, and go to the nearest village in which a priest
    lived. He should ask the priest to consecrate the bread, and on
    his return the deacon should hand it out to the
    villagers.<note place="foot" xml:id="#FN13" n="13">

                </note> However, according to John of Ephesus’
    story of <hi rend="italic">Simeon the Mountaineer</hi>, not every village had
    its own deacon, and was also not enthusiastic to change this.
    When in 515 CE Simeon reached a quite prosperous village near
    the Euphrates, bordering to the territory of Claudias, and
    inquired about their church and how they would receive
    communion, some of the villagers laughed at him and said:
    "‘How, blessed sir, does the oblation that a man receives
    profit him? For what [purpose] is the oblation?’"<note place="foot" xml:id="#FN14" n="14">

                </note>
    Nevertheless, these shepherds felt quite offended when Simeon
    asked them if they were Jews. They wholeheartedly considered
    themselves to be Christians although they had been cut off from
    the sacraments for years. The shepherds even related to the
    saint that people lived in the mountains who did not know what
    a church was, and most of their fellows had only seen one at
    the time they were baptized as children or when their own
    children were baptized. The neighboring village still had a
    church, but it was no longer in use, and one of the villagers
    told Simeon that they would receive the Eucharist only if they
    had business in a village which had a priest: "‘If not,
    no one here has this concern for the oblation.’" John of
    Ephesus, of course, intends to point out the villagers’
    outrageous unchristian behavior in order to make the
    achievement of his saint—who installed himself as priest
    in the second village—even greater. Nevertheless, it is
    obvious that not every village had a priest and it is necessary
    to ask why.</p>

    answer may be found if it is possible to find out who became a
    priest and how. It was important that prospective members of
    the clergy be taught the Scriptures, and John of Ephesus,
    recording the achievements of John of Tella, was anxious to
    point out that the bishop of Tella was very careful in
    selecting his candidates for the priesthood. John of Tella was
    "performing the ordinations after careful investigation and
    many testimonies given, subjecting every man to a careful
    examination and test in reading the Scriptures and repeating
    the psalms, and ability to write their names and
    signatures."<note place="foot" xml:id="#FN15" n="15">

    Therefore a well-to-do man who became priest would make the
    local church more powerful, while at the same time he would
    increase his own social status. As priest he became a respected

    which believed that people could be possessed by demons and

    was influential as he could suspend people from communion
    temporarily, or even excommunicate or anathematize them. The

    anathematize people out of vengeance or for other personal

    villagers must have been aware of these problems. Therefore the
    question remains: why did the villagers nevertheless accept
    rather unsuitable candidates for the priesthood? An answer may
    lie in the advantages a well-to-do priest brought to the
    villagers. They would be rewarded twice: immediately after the
    installment as the new priest would enable the villagers to
    arrange a banquet in order to celebrate the recent ordination.
    In fact, they could profit also in the long run as the
    well-to-do priest may have endowed the church with his own
    money and therefore lighten the burden of the villagers who
    usually had to contribute to the church’s expenses. As
    John of Tella reminds the priests, the hospitality for
    strangers, but also the care of the poor, orphans and widows
    was a joint-partnership of church, priest and

    These texts demonstrate the need for basic knowledge concerning
    the sacramental life of the church as well as some
    clerics’ desire to learn what they needed to know. The
    essential problem remains that priests and deacons could not
    learn their profession in the cathedral of their bishops
    because their bishops were in exile. Bishops like John of Tella
    had to send instructions by letter from exile. These letters
    also show the concern of the exiled non-Chalcedonian bishops:
    would the priests stand by their bishops or convert under
    pressure from the Chalcedonians? Several canons deal in part
    with clergy who had been at some point in the service of the
    Chalcedonians; they distinguish between clergy who were
    ordained by non-Chalcedonians and "joined the heretics
    […] by necessity or by transgression,"<note place="foot" xml:id="#FN51" n="51">

    nobles and clergy thought "‘[i]f the imperial edict

             John of Tella’s strong opposition to

    Chalcedonian and non-Chalcedonian bishops alternated several
    times, as had certainly been the case in Tella, then this
    instability must have left theologically less trained lower
    clergy numbed and confused about which Eucharist was orthodox.
    They may have accepted the different christological preferences
    of their overlords without opposition.<note place="foot" xml:id="#FN56" n="56">

             Nothing is said about non-Chalcedonian names

    Chalcedonian names. 
         </p>
                </note> The
    non-Chalcedonians were threatened by the fact that Chalcedon
    was now backed up by an imperial edict which, as quoted above,
    made an impact on the nobles and clergy of Tella. It is highly
    likely that the lower clergy in most towns in the
    East—left behind by their non-Chalcedonian
    bishop—first accepted the <hi rend="italic">libellus</hi> as the canons

                </note> That would mean
    that "defections," or rather the shifting of loyalty, may have
    been more common among the average priests than it was among
    bishops and monks. In this situation the average priest may not
    have been able to live up to his supposed duty to give
    spiritual guidance to the laity and advise them on the
    sacrament of the Eucharist.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P20"/>[20] In
    conclusion, the high cosmological boundary between
    Chalcedonians and non-Chalcedonians drawn in hagiography was
    more permeable in everyday life in the cities and villages in
    the East. Some villagers were completely cut off from the
    sacrament, and did not have the desire to get a priest who
    would take away the tenth of their harvest. In their
    understanding, baptism was crucial and would make them
    Christians regardless of whether they took the Eucharist or
    not. Other villagers probably did not know much about the
    Eucharist because it is likely that their priests did not know
    much about this sacrament either.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P21"/>[21] The
    addressees in Severus’ letters were certainly not the
    average laity, but aristocrats who obviously cared for the
    Eucharist. They wanted to receive the sacrament from someone
    who was like the saints they knew from reading the
    non-Chalcedonian hagiographic accounts—someone like Peter
    the Iberian. They believed that this would ensure the validity
    of the sacrament, certified by the celebrant who, like Severus
    of Antioch, lived up to the standards set in hagiographic
    accounts. Other non-Chalcedonians may have also seen a division
    between Chalcedonians and non-Chalcedonians but, like the
    nobles and clergy in Tella, considered the imperial edict
    paramount. It was therefore the bishops who tried to draw a
    clear line, and enforce the understanding of the "orthodox"
    Eucharist as necessary for salvation, but the demarcation often
    had less impact on their followers than the bishops may have
    wished.</p>_______<lb/>

             John of Tella’s strong opposition to
    Chalcedon is clearly visible in
    his—unpublished—letter to the monks around Tella
    which he probably wrote on his installment as bishop of this
    city: BL Add. 14549, 219b-226b (see note 6 above). <ref target="#FNRef54">

             Only Sophronius is mentioned by name; for
    Sophronius see E. Honigmann, "The original lists of the members

    Chalcedon" (<hi rend="italic">Byzantion</hi> 16 [1942/3]), 51 and 70.

         <p>
             Nothing is said about non-Chalcedonian names
    in the diptychs, but as John apparently erased "only" some
    names from the diptychs, there must have been also
    non-Chalcedonian bishops before John who did not erase
    Chalcedonian names. <ref target="#FNRef56">

         <p>
             It is not clear, however, if clergymen who
    remained in the city were always employed under the new bishop.
    For obedience to higher clergy, intended of course only for
    non-Chalcedonians towards a non-Chalcedonian bishop, see John
    of Tella, <hi rend="italic">Canons</hi> 25, in The Synodicon, ed.

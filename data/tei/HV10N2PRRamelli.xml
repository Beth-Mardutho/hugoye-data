         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P1"/>[1] This
    rich and fine book (a revision of the author's doctoral
    dissertation) provides an intellectual and institutional
    history of the scholastic culture of the Church of the
    East—above all of the School of Nisibis—in the late
    antique and early Islamic periods. The work sheds light on the
    development of Christian <hi rend="italic">paideia</hi> in Late Antiquity and
    the rise of the Babylonian Jewish academies, and exposes the
    importance of the East-Syrian school movement as the background
    to the intellectual culture to come, a point that has not yet
    been fully appreciated.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P2"/>[2] The
    present study is all more valuable in that the East Syrians,
    called "Nestorians" by their enemies, continue to exist all
    over the world, in the Middle East, in South India, and in the
    Diaspora, e.g. in the U.S.A. (especially in the Midwest), in
    Australia, and in Sweden. Thus it is entirely appropriate that
    in a "Note on Transliteration, Spelling, and Terminology"
    (xiii-xiv) the author, in line with S. Brock, "The
    ‘Nestorian’ Church: A Lamentable Misnomer,"
    <hi rend="italic">Bulletin of the John Rylands Library of Manchester</hi> 78
    (1996) 23-36, sensibly rejects the denomination "Nestorians"
    for the East Syrians, and also declares his preference for
    "Miaphysite" rather than "Monophysite," according to the
    terminology adopted by Lucas van Rompay. These in fact are more
    accurate denominations, and at the same time much more
    respectful.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P3"/>[3] After a
    useful Chronology from AD 363 to 1020 (xv-xvi), the
    Introduction (1-21) provides valuable guidelines for the
    readers. First of all, Becker sketches the history of the
    passage of the exegesis and scholarly practice from the School
    of the Persians of Edessa to the School of Nisibis, and follows
    the development of this school along with its leaders. He notes
    that the East-Syrian scholastic culture grew at the same time
    and in the same place as that of one of the main cultural
    products of the late antique and early Medieval Near East, viz.
    the Babylonian Talmud. The author remarks that in ancient
    Mesopotamia Jews and Christians spoke the same language, lived
    under the same rulers, and shared the same Scriptures and
    mystical and eschatological speculation. In particular, a full
    comparative study of the School of Nisibis and the Rabbinic
    academies of Babylonia is still a <hi rend="italic">desideratum</hi>. This
    is, according to the author, due largely to the model of the
    "Parting of the Ways" between Judaism and Christianity, which
    prevented scholars from a joint investigation of Jewish and
    Christian institutions of learning in Late Antiquity. (I note
    that a good contribution to criticism against a too sharp
    "Parting of the Ways" model is to be found in the miscellaneous
    work edited by the author himself and Annette Yoshiko Reed,
    <hi rend="italic">The Ways that Never Parted: Jews and Christians in Late
    Antiquity and the Early Middle Ages</hi>, Tübingen 2003).
    In the introduction Becker also presents the main intellectual
    historical source for the School of Nisibis and one of the
    chief sources for the School of the Persians in Edessa, a
    source on which a good part of this book depends: the <hi rend="italic">Cause
    of the Foundation of the Schools</hi> by Barhadbshabba, of the
    sixth century, which combines different traditions, from
    Ephrem, Theodore of Mopsuestia, Evagrius of Pontus, and
    Neoplatonism. In this text, all historical figures are
    understood in pedagogical terms, which is a fundamental
    feature.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P4"/>[4] Becker
    remarks that the educational system was alike for Christians
    and non-Christians in late antiquity, although some Christian
    schools had particular characteristics, e.g. those run by
    Justin, Clement, and Origen—but there, too, classical
    culture and philosophy were present and alive and the author
    correctly observes that it is doubtful whether Origen himself
    was attempting to develop a completely autonomous Christian
    culture. On this point, I would add some important
    contributions: H. Crouzel, <hi rend="italic">Cultura e fede nella scuola di
    Cesarea con Origene</hi>, in <hi rend="italic">Crescita dell'uomo nella
    catechesi dei Padri</hi>, Rome 1987, 203-209; M. Rizzi, "Il
    <hi rend="italic">didaskalos</hi> nella tradizione alessandrina, da Clemente
    alla <hi rend="italic">Oratio Panegyrica in Origenem</hi>," in <hi rend="italic">Magister.

    G. Zecchini, Milan 1999, 177-198; Gregorio il Taumaturgo (?),
    <hi rend="italic">Encomio di Origene</hi>, ed. Id., Milan 2002; J.W. Trigg,
    "God's Marvelous Oikonomia: Reflections of Origen's
    Understanding of Divine and Human Pedagogy in the Address
    Ascribed to Gregory Thaumaturgus," <hi rend="italic">Journal of Early
    Christian Studies</hi> 9 (2001) 27-52; L. Lugaresi, "Studenti
    cristiani e scuola pagana," <hi rend="italic">Cristianesimo nella Storia</hi>
    25 (2004) 779-832; A. Grafton — M. Williams,
    <hi rend="italic">Christianity and the Transformation of the Book</hi>,
    Cambridge-London 2006, 22-132; J. Tloka, <hi rend="italic">Griechische
    Christen, Christliche Griechen</hi>, Tübingen 2006,
    25-126. As an example of a fruitful transmission of the liberal
    arts to the Middle Ages, the author mentions Cassiodorus’
    <hi rend="italic">Institutiones</hi>, and we might also recall
    Boethius’ treatises and Martianus Capella’s <hi rend="italic">De
    Nuptiis Philologiae et Mercurii</hi> (cf. e.g. my <hi rend="italic">Marziano
    Capella</hi>, Milan 2001), which was studied and commented on
    throughout the Middle Ages (editions, essays and commentaries
    in my <hi rend="italic">Tutti i commenti a Marziano Capella: Scoto Eriugena,
    Remigio di Auxerre, Bernardo Silvestre e anonimi</hi>, Milan
    2006). According to Becker, in fact, the classical
    <hi rend="italic">paideia</hi> was destroyed not by the Christians, but by
    the barbarians, and for this reason classical culture in the
    East remained more stable and endured longer than in the West
    of the Roman empire; the East-Syrian school movement developed
    outside the Roman empire, but was based on classical
    <hi rend="italic">paideia</hi> and the Scriptures, just like the Christian
    <hi rend="italic">paideia</hi> that grew inside Roman territory. The <hi rend="italic">Book
    of the Laws of Countries</hi>, e.g., by Bardaisan (or perhaps
    by his school, we might add; see e.g. my "Linee generali per
    una presentazione e per un commento del Liber legum regionum,
    con traduzione italiana del testo siriaco e dei frammenti
    greci," <hi rend="italic">RIL</hi> 133 [1999] 311-355) is a philosophical
    dialogue written on the model of the Platonic dialogues: in it,
    the Christian character of Bardaisan argues against the
    determinism of the stars.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P5"/>[5] The
    first chapter, "Divine Pedagogy and the Transmission of the
    Knowledge of God: The Discursive Background of the School
    Movement" (22-40), examines the tendency, well attested in the
    Syriac milieu and most evident in the <hi rend="italic">Cause</hi>, to
    understand Christian belief and practice in pedagogical terms,
    and the conversion to Christianity as a kind of pedagogical
    conversion. The first roots of pedagogical imagery go back to
    the very beginning of Christianity, where in the Gospels Jesus
    is a master with his disciples, and Judaism, according to
    Josephus, had <hi rend="italic">hairéseis</hi> named after the Greek
    philosophical schools. Justin, Clement, and Origen understood
    Christianity in pedagogical terms: for Origen, I note that this
    conception is closely linked to the role of the Holy Spirit, on
    which I now refer to M. Beyer Moser, <hi rend="italic">Teacher of
    Holiness</hi>. <hi rend="italic">The Holy Spirit</hi> 
            <hi rend="italic">in Origen’s
    Commentary on the Epistle to the Romans</hi>, Piscataway, NJ
    2005. Becker exemplifies how the Peshitta tends to develop a
    pedagogical terminology, which of course facilitated the
    pedagogical reading of Scripture, e.g., with prophets as
    masters with their own schools, etc. Becker illustrates the
    imagery of pedagogy in several Syriac authors, especially
    Ephrem and Jacob of Sarug. Another aspect that seems to have
    been influential is that scribes in the Syrian area were more
    self-conscious than the Greek ones. In documents such as the
    <hi rend="italic">Acts of the Persian Martyrs</hi>, or the <hi rend="italic">Life of John
    of Tella</hi>, moreover, we find conversion to Christianity as
    a passage from one school to another, and Zoroastrianism
    described as the "school of the Magi," and Christianity as
    "discipleship of Jesus," implying much study, so that from
    outside it could even be misunderstood as "sadness."  This
    finds, I believe, an interesting parallel in several Latin and
    Greek sources on early Christians and the accusations of
    <hi rend="italic">tristitia</hi> brought against them, which also involved
    the philosophers, especially the Stoics. See my
    "<hi rend="italic">Tristitia</hi>. Indagine storica, filosofica e semantica
    su un'accusa antistoica e anticristiana," <hi rend="italic">Invigilata</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">Lucernis</hi> 23 (2001) 187-206.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P6"/>[6] In the
    second chapter, "The School of the Persians (Part 1): Rereading
    the Sources" (41-61), the author challenges scholars’
    traditional assumption that the School of Nisibis is an
    immediate and direct descendant of the School of the Persians
    of Edessa. A critical reading of the evidence for the School of
    the Persians rather suggests that we know much less about this
    institution than was previously supposed, since both sources
    and scholars tended to project the sixth-century School of
    Nisibis onto fifth-century Edessa, and the sources themselves
    are often problematic, dependent on one another, contradictory
    and influenced by polemics of their own time. Becker usefully
    distributes them into three groups: 1) West-Syrian sources,
    involved in Miaphysite propaganda opposed to the so-called
    Nestorians and to Chalcedonians as well, such as the letter of
    Simeon of Bet Arsham, which is the earliest source (loosely)
    connecting Ibas to the School of the Persians and contains
    inaccuracies, or Jacob of Sarug’s Letter 14, an
    apologetic document, and again, the <hi rend="italic">Chronicle of
    Edessa</hi>, the <hi rend="italic">Chronicles</hi> of Ps. Dionysius of
    Tell-Mahre and of Michael the Syrian, and John of
    Ephesus’ hagiographical work; 2) Costantinopolitan
    sources, i.e. Theodore Anagnostes and the <hi rend="italic">Life of Alexander
    the Sleepless</hi>, in which the relevant passage is
    interestingly suggested by the author to be an extrapolation
    from the Acts of the "Latrocinium" Council of Ephesus (449),
    and 3) East-Syrian sources: the <hi rend="italic">Cause</hi> and the
    <hi rend="italic">Ecclesiastical History</hi> by Barhadbshabba, attentively
    compared by the author, and the <hi rend="italic">Chronicle of Arbela</hi>,
    which directly connects Ibas to the School of the Persians,
    which is probably not correct.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P7"/>[7] In the
    third chapter, "The School of the Persians (Part 2): From
    Ethnic Circle to Theological School" (62-76), Becker places the
    sources for the School of the Persians in a better framework,
    more appropriate to fifth-century Edessa, beginning with the
    only source prior to the closure of the school (489), the Acts
    of the "Latrocinium" Council of Ephesus of 449. It emerges that
    this school seems more similar to a loosely knit study circle
    than to an institution; moreover, the Acts mention three
    "schools" in Edessa that subscribed against Ibas the bishop:
    those of the Armenians, of the Persians, and of the Syrians.
    This suggests that the School of the Persians had a somewhat
    ethnic aspect, that Ibas was not closely associated to this
    school, as it is often assumed, and that the school itself was
    not generally known for its dyophysite leanings. It is likely
    that toward the middle of the fifth century the schools in
    Edessa did not have easily identifiable theological positions,
    but were essentially ethnic groupings, maybe voluntary
    associations similar to the Latin <hi rend="italic">collegia</hi> and the
    like: "school" might have been a somewhat metaphorical
    designation, like the Greek <hi rend="italic">hairesis</hi>, that was applied
    to the Greek philosophical schools, and also to the Christians,
    and to the Jewish groups of the time of Josephus. In the V
    century, many people came to Edessa both from Persia and from
    Armenia, such as Moses of Chorene: the author sensibly
    considers him trustworthy when he declares that he travelled to
    Edessa and employed its archives, as Eusebius had done in the
    previous century (see my "Possible Historical Traces in the
    <hi rend="italic">Doctrina Addai</hi>?", <hi rend="italic">Hugoye</hi> 9,1 [2006]
    §§ 1-24).</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P8"/>[8] Only
    shortly before its closure, according to the <hi rend="italic">Cause</hi> and
    the <hi rend="italic">Ecclesiatical History</hi> by Barhadbshabba, the School
    of the Persians was divided into a tripartite hierarchy, very
    similar to the arrangement of the Greco-Roman educational
    system (<hi rend="italic">mhagyana</hi> = <hi rend="italic">magister ludi</hi> or
    <hi rend="italic">harenarius</hi>; <hi rend="italic">maqryana</hi> = grammarian;
    <hi rend="italic">mphashqana</hi> or exegete = <hi rend="italic">rhetor</hi>,
    <hi rend="italic">philosophus</hi>). Another remarkable point made by the
    author is that there was only one exodus from the School of the
    Persians in Edessa to Nisibis, which occurred in 489 after the
    closure of the school itself by order of the Emperor Zeno.
    Vööbus was led to suppose two exoduses—one in
    471 by Narsai, and the other, larger, in 489—by reading
    the same event, described in the <hi rend="italic">Cause</hi> and in the
    <hi rend="italic">Ecclesiastical History</hi>, as two different facts. At the
    end of the chapter, Becker observes a couple of things that may
    be significant and should stimulate further comparative
    studies: 1) the closure of the School of the Persians by order
    of the emperor Zeno displays a deep affinity to that of the
    School of Athens forty years later, in 529, by order of the
    emperor Justinian. 2) In many different sources, this event is
    described with the same terminology: all say that the school
    was "uprooted," just as several sources pun on the name of
    Nisibis while saying that the same School of the Persian was
    "planted" (<hi rend="italic">nsb</hi>) there. Becker also suggests exploring
    whether any ethnically-based intellectual circles developed in
    other intellectual centres in late antiquity, such as Athens,
    Jerusalem or Beirut, which would be very interesting to
    investigate.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P9"/>[9] In the
    fourth chapter, "The School of Nisibis" (77-97), Becker
    carefully analyzes the evidence for the School of Nisibis, its
    foundation, its daily life, and its curriculum. Among its
    models were contemporary cenobitic institutions, the School of
    the Persians in Edessa, and maybe also the local school led by
    the interpreter Simeon of Kashkar in Nisibis when the new
    school was founded, perhaps incorporating students of
    Simeon’s school. The author also examines various sets of
    canons of the School of Nisibis, valuable for reconstructing
    its daily life and the organization of teaching. and presents
    the literary production of the scholars attached to the School:
    commentaries, in <hi rend="italic">memre</hi> and then in prose, where also
    the "Alexandrian" allegorical technique crept in; liturgical
    works, treatises and "causes." Illuminating comparisons with
    the organization of other schools are also provided, and the
    author rightly insists on the close parallelism between the
    school year and the liturgical year.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P10"/>[10] The
    intellectual life of the School of Nisibis is the focus of
    chapters Five through Seven, and is reconstructed on the basis
    of the examination of the <hi rend="italic">Cause</hi>. In particular, the
    fifth chapter, "The Scholastic Genre: the <hi rend="italic">Cause of the
    Foundation of the Schools</hi>" (98-112), addresses the
    question of the literary genre of the <hi rend="italic">Cause</hi>, which is
    relevant to the understanding of study at the School of
    Nisibis: it seems that the <hi rend="italic">Cause</hi> is associated with
    the explication of the Christian liturgical cycle, which
    suggests that the school year was seen as part of the holy
    calendar, and that study itself was conceived as a form of
    liturgy. The author recalls first of all that only recently has
    the <hi rend="italic">Cause</hi> been given scholarly attention, in studies
    such as D.S. Wallace-Hadrill, <hi rend="italic">Christian Antioch</hi>. <hi rend="italic">A

    <hi rend="italic">Cause</hi> and the problem of its relationship to the
    <hi rend="italic">Ecclesiastical History</hi> of Bar<hi rend="&#34;u&#34;">h</hi>adbshabba ‘Arbaya, and that of
    its authorship by Barhadbshabba d-Halwan, who may be the same
    as the former, Becker observes that the literary genres that
    seem to be present in the <hi rend="italic">Cause</hi> are: the "cause"
    genre, derived from the classical <hi rend="italic">aitia</hi> and mainly
    represented in the Syriac tradition by the "causes of
    festivals," which explained the origins of a celebration and
    its theological ground; the protreptic tone, derived from the
    protreptics to philosophy, and then to Christianity; the
    collective biography, and the scholastic "chain of
    transmission" found in the "successions of philosophers" (on
    which see documentation e.g. in my "Diogene Laerzio storico del
    pensiero antico tra biografia e dossografia, ‘successioni
    di filosofi’ e scuole filosofiche," in <hi rend="italic">Diogene
    Laerzio, Vite e dottrine dei più celebri filosofi</hi>,
    ed. G. Reale, Milan 2005, XXXIII-CXXXVIII) and later of
    apostles and bishops, and also in Rabbinic sources: most
    interestingly, Becker points out a terminological similarity
    between the <hi rend="italic">Cause</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Avot</hi> Becker also
    provides a better translation for the title of the
    <hi rend="italic">Cause</hi>: rather than <hi rend="italic">Cause of the Foundation of the
    Schools</hi>, he proposes <hi rend="italic">Cause of the Establishment of the
    Session of the School</hi>, a rendering that is well grounded
    in Syriac and helps us to understand the writing as an opening
    and official address to the students and teachers of the School
    of Nisibis.</p>

    Chapters Six and Seven analyze the contents of the
    <hi rend="italic">Cause</hi> and place it within its cultural context. The
    sixth chapter, "The Reception of Theodore of Mopsuestia in the
    School of Nisibis" (113-125), demonstrates that the
    <hi rend="italic">Cause</hi> depends on a sixth-century version of
    Theodore’s thought, attested not only in the East-Syrian
    Church, but also in Greek and Latin authors. The author
    recalls, first of all, the veneration for Theodore of
    Mopsuestia in the East-Syrian Church, where he is the
    theological and exegetical authority par excellence, and in
    particular in the School of Nisibis, and the translations of
    his works into Syriac, which has turned out to be all the more
    valuable in that, after the condemnation of his doctrines in
    553, most of his writings have been lost in Greek, and are
    extant only in fragments. Thence, Becker interestingly develops
    the suggestion by Macina, Wallace-Hadrill, and Reinink, that
    the <hi rend="italic">Cause</hi> ultimately depends on Theodore’s idea
    of divine <hi rend="italic">paideia</hi>, and, after giving a brief account
    of his thought in general, he focuses on the pedagogical
    conception of history and of the relationship between God and
    humans, and illustrates how pedagogical terminology in the
    <hi rend="italic">Cause</hi> and in the Syriac translation of Theodore
    converge. I definitely agree with the author that we ought not
    to stress the opposition between Alexandrine and Antiochene
    exegesis (cf. e.g. my "Giovanni Crisostomo e l'esegesi
    scritturale: le scuole di Alessandria e di Antiochia e le
    polemiche con gli allegoristi pagani," in <hi rend="italic">Giovanni
    Crisostomo: Oriente e Occidente tra IV e V secolo</hi>. Atti
    del XXXIII Incontro di Studiosi dell'Antichità
    Cristiana, Roma, Augustinianum 6-8.V.2004, I, Roma 2005,
    121-162). Becker also states that the focus on the human being
    as the image of God in the <hi rend="italic">Cause</hi> is an extremely
    common Antiochene motif, which is absolutely correct; we may
    nevertheless observe that the so-called "theology of the
    image", which sees the human being as <hi rend="italic">eikōn tou
    Theou</hi>—according to <hi rend="italic">Genesis</hi> 1:26-27—is
    central and crucial also in the Cappadocians, and above all in
    Gregory of Nyssa, who inherited it essentially from Origen: and
    in fact, the three Cappadocians’ writings are well
    attested in Syriac, and Basil’s <hi rend="italic">Hexaemeron</hi>,
    continued by Gregory of Nyssa’s <hi rend="italic">De hominis
    opificio</hi>, was highly influential in Syriac literature and
    for an understanding of the book of <hi rend="italic">Genesis</hi>. In any
    case, the author is right that Theodore of Mopsuestia’s
    commentary on <hi rend="italic">Genesis</hi>, insofar as it can be
    reconstructed, seems to lie behind the <hi rend="italic">Cause</hi>’s
    understanding of <hi rend="italic">Genesis</hi> 1: the author of the
    <hi rend="italic">Cause</hi> puts Theodore’s notion of divine
    <hi rend="italic">paideia</hi> into more concrete terms, speaking not only of
    God who instructed the angels at creation and human beings
    throughout history, but even of classrooms and schools
    instituted by God. The author reasonably suggests that the
    connection between Theodore and the <hi rend="italic">Cause</hi> may have
    been Narsai, who studied Theodore in Syriac and, as far as we
    know, is the first who described creation as a school class
    with books, pens, etc., in similes.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P12"/>[12] The
    seventh chapter, "Spelling God’s Name with the Letters of
    Creation: The Use of Neoplatonic Aristotle in the
    <hi rend="italic">Cause</hi>" (126-154), studies the Neoplatonic
    interpretation of Aristotelian logic that crept into the
    East-Syrian Church from the beginning of the VI century onward.
    Becker shows how the <hi rend="italic">Cause</hi> uses this material to
    develop a natural theology that also contains reminiscences
    from Ephrem and Evagrius. Relying on Sebastian Brock’s
    noteworthy suggestions, the author challenges the widespread
    assumption that philosophical materials like Aristotle’s
    writings and Porphyry’s <hi rend="italic">Isagoge</hi> were imported
    into Nisibis by the Edessan School of the Persians after its
    migration. In fact, the evidence for such studies in
    fifth-century Edessa is thin, especially because it seems to be
    a mistake to place Probus, the early Syriac commentator and
    translator of Aristotle’s logical works, in Edessa in the
    V century. Aristotle’s logic, read through the
    Neoplatonists – as has been shown above all by R. Sorabji
    –, arrived at Nisibis later and through another way,
    probably thanks to direct contacts with Alexandria, as again
    has been suggested by Brock and confirmed by several other
    proofs.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P13"/>[13] Of
    course, Greek philosophy had been absorbed in the Syriac
    culture already since the days of Bardaisan (documentation in
    my "Bardesane e la sua scuola tra la cultura occidentale e
    quella orientale," in <hi rend="italic">Pensiero e istituzioni del mondo
    classico nelle culture del Vicino Oriente</hi>, eds. R.B.
    Finazzi - A. Valvo, Alessandria 2001, 237-255) and Ephrem (for
    the presence of philosophy in whose works see U. Possekel,
    <hi rend="italic">Evidence of Greek Philosophical Concepts in the Writings of
    Ephrem the Syrian</hi>, Louvain 1999). I suggest that we might
    even go back to Mara bar Serapion and his philosophical letter
    to his son, which might be very ancient: see my "Gesù
    tra i sapienti greci perseguitati ingiustamente in un antico
    documento filosofico pagano di lingua siriaca," <hi rend="italic">Rivista di
    Filosofia Neoscolastica</hi> 97 (2005) 545-570; D. Rensberger,
    "Reconsidering the Letter of Mara Bar Serapion," in <hi rend="italic">Aramaic
    Studies in Judaism and Early Christianity</hi>, Winona Lake
    2006, forthcoming (I am very grateful to the author for sharing
    his study with me). Another article on Mara's letter, its Stoic
    ideas and early date is forthcoming by Teun Tieleman and
    Annette Merz in a Festschrift for P.W. van der Horst. And of
    course Greek philosophy came also through Greek Patristic
    authors translated into Syriac – especially Platonism.
    The author tries to trace the philosophical background of the
    <hi rend="italic">Cause</hi>, especially in the initial sections of this
    writing, where general philosophical issues are put forward;
    and here both Ephrem’s and Evagrius’ influence is
    detected, and also, e.g., that of the Tree of Porphyry, read
    through later Neoplatonism and transferred from logic to
    metaphysics. Again the Neoplatonists, and Theodore of
    Mopsuestia, are reasonably supposed to lie behind the issue of
    the epistemological inaccessibility of God, also addressed by
    the <hi rend="italic">Cause</hi>, according to which, as a consequence, names
    can only be attributed to God by analogy. Once more, we may
    recall also Gregory of Nyssa, who held a mitigated form of
    apophatism that is central to his whole doctrine. Actually, the
    author himself remarks that some terminology of apophatism in
    the <hi rend="italic">Cause</hi> may derive from Evagrius, who knew the
    Nyssene very well. In sum, it seems to me that the author
    demonstrates quite finely that the philosophical background of
    the <hi rend="italic">Cause</hi> derives from both fifth-century Edessa and
    the spread of Greek philosophical literature in Mesopotamia in
    the sixth century. Some methodological indications by Becker
    are also valuable: much work is still required on the reception
    of Greek philosophical texts and ideas in Syriac, such as an
    edition of the earliest Syriac translation of Aristotle’s
    <hi rend="italic">Categories</hi>.</p>

    Chapters Eight and Nine recontextualize the School of Nisibis
    and the whole East-Syrian school movement in the frame of
    East-Syrian monasticism. The eighth chapter, "A Typology of
    East-Syrian Schools" (155-168), analyzes the sources for the
    various kinds of East-Syrian schools in late antique and early
    Islamic Mesopotamia, of which the evidence has not yet been
    gathered by any scholar. The main sources are the <hi rend="italic">Book of
    Chastity</hi> by Ishodenah of Basra, of the late eighth or the
    ninth century; the <hi rend="italic">Book of Governors</hi> by Thomas of
    Marga, of the ninth century, and the <hi rend="italic">Chronicle of
    Siirt</hi> (or <hi rend="italic">Seert</hi>, as it is often transcribed), of
    the tenth or early eleventh century. A division into three
    different groups is proposed by the author: independent
    schools, monastic schools, and village schools. The first group
    is represented first of all by the School of Nisibis itself,
    attested from the end of the fifth to the early seventh
    century, but also, e.g., by the School of Seleucia, independent
    of any monastery or church building, under the patronage of the
    Catholicos or even the Persian king. There were the School of
    Seleucia, too, founded by Paul the Reader, that of Kashkar,
    perhaps, that of Balad and that of Bet Sahde in Nisibis, about
    which we do not know whether it was meant to counter the School
    of Nisibis, as Fiey supposed. Our sources often are not so
    clear when they say there was a school in a monastery, since
    they tend to conflate monasteries and schools, and thus we do
    not know the extent to which the school was a formal
    institution. As for village schools, they were small and
    associated neither with large ecclesiastical centres nor with
    monasteries, but sometimes attached to the local church; some
    could even offer some exegetical teaching and advanced
    learning. Many were founded by Babai of Gbilta in the eighth
    century.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P15"/>[15] In
    the ninth chapter, "The Monastic Context of the East-Syrian
    School Movement" (169-203), the author argues that, on the one
    hand, although not all schools were connected to monasteries,
    the general phenomenon of East Syrian schools is impossible to
    understand outside East-Syrian monasticism: even the
    independent School of Nisibis was modelled on monastic life; on
    the other hand, the schools also developed into entities that
    were semi-distinct from the monasteries, because of the
    institutional and intellectual differences that existed within
    the East-Syrian Church. One meaningful instance is cited of
    monks who refused the institution of a school in their
    monastery, because of their conception of monastic life as more
    ascetic than cenobitic: in Syrian monasticism, more and more
    emphasis was put on prayer, silence and solitude, and the
    communal life of school and book learning were progressively
    felt as merely earlier stages of spiritual development. This
    was also due to the influence of Egyptian monasticism, which is
    closely studied by the author, who mentions the new rules for
    monks by Abraham of Kashkar, inspired by the Egyptian desert
    Fathers. The last stage, for which the author presents good
    evidence, is the explicit criticism of philosophy, bookishness,
    and the School movement in several monastic authors. Becker
    also illustrates many transformations in the Church of Syria
    from the fifth century onwards: early figures felt as
    heterodox, such as Bardaisan and Tatian, were forgotten or
    rejected; urban ascetics were put under the control of bishops
    and the others removed from cities; the religious history of
    Edessa was reconstructed as orthodox from the very beginning.
    The author also depicts the enormous influence of the Origenist
    Evagrius of Pontus on Syriac intellectual and religious
    culture. The map includes two other Syrian Origenists,
    Ps.-Dionysius the Areopagite and Stephen Bar Sudaili: I am not
    surprised that Origen’s chief doctrine, that of 
    apocatastasis, appears again in a later Syriac ascetic, Isaac
    of Nineveh. An appendix is devoted to the decline of the School
    of Nisibis at the beginning of the seventh century—the
    sources for it become sparse after the sixth—, and Becker
    hypothesizes that this might be connected to the controversy
    surrounding Hnana of Adiabene, who led the school in those
    days: the Barhadbshabba who wrote the <hi rend="italic">Cause</hi>, which
    comprises high praises of Hnana, may be the same as the one who
    signed the condemnation of Hnana and left the School of
    Nisibis: in this case, we should suppose a change in his
    attitude toward Hnana. This is entirely possible, since the
    <hi rend="italic">Cause</hi> was probably written before the outbreak of the
    controversy, which is, at any rate, particularly difficult to
    reconstruct: he too was charged with "Origenism," but this had
    meantime become so multivalent and vague an accusation that it
    is not clear what the point of the controversy was.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P16"/>[16] In
    the Conclusion (204-210), the author also indicates further
    areas of possible investigation, which surely would be
    fruitful: philosophical culture in the Sasanian empire, the
    conflict between East and West Syrians in Mesopotamia, the
    Armenian sources for the intellectual culture of fifth-century
    Edessa, or the nature of the "cause" genre. He also meditates
    on what emerges from his overall investigation and
    interpretation of the sources: in East-Syrian Christian
    schools, learning was not merely an intellectual act, and study
    was more than a purely mental activity. A significant example
    is that of Mar Narsai in Barhadbshabba’s
    <hi rend="italic">Ecclesiatical History</hi>, where his study practice cannot
    be separated from his asceticism, which is conceived in terms
    of imitation of the angels, that is, ceaseless worship of God,
    a liturgical activity. All this points to a holistic view that
    joins both the intellectual and the practical, performative
    side of life. The <hi rend="italic">Cause</hi> was a speech delivered to
    welcome students who entered the School of Nisibis and was
    aimed at presenting the whole history as a long succession of
    schools and to have each student feel a part of the cosmic
    order, performing his duty of study as a way of life. The
    author rightly sees this conception in line with the notion of
    ancient philosophy as a way of life, to which especially Pierre
    Hadot has recently called attention. This was true of Roman
    Stoicism, of the Hellenistic philosophical schools in general,
    but also of Pythagoreanism, for example (on which see, e.g.,
    the introduction by Francesco Romano to his edition,
    <hi rend="italic">Giamblico. Summa Pitagorica: Vita di Pitagora, Esortazione
    alla filosofia, Scienza matematica comune, Introduzione
    all’</hi> Aritmetica <hi rend="italic">di Nicomaco, Teologia
    dell’aritmetica</hi>, Milan 2006). This idea was kept up
    by the Christians, and it is particularly evident in the East
    Syrian scholastic movement, as the author finely illustrates.
    It is a pity that this important and sanctifying experience was
    restricted to only half of the Christians, just as it happened
    in Rabbinic schools as well, whereas already some Greek
    philosophical schools were open to women too.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P17"/>[17] The
    chapters are followed by the Notes, mostly devoted to
    bibliographical references and the indication of the sources,
    but also containing several valuable side-remarks (211-274).
    The Bibliography is selected but rich, relevant and up to date
    (275-286). In the last pages of the volume we find the Index
    (287-296), which is detailed and quite helpful, given the wide
    range of materials touched upon by the author in his treatment,
    and the Acknowledgments (297-298).</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P18"/>[18] This
    book definitely is a valuable contribution that is worth
    reading with close attention. Some pages in the Table of
    Contents do not correspond to those we find in the book itself
    (e.g. the Note on Terminology is not found on pp. xi-xii, as it
    appears in the Contents, but on xiii-xiv), but the volume is
    very carefully realized and excellent in its overall quality,
    both in its contents and arguments and in the arrangement and
    presentation of the materials. It deserves to be warmly
    recommended for the valuable insights it offers to scholars who
    study the development of Christian culture in the Syriac
    speaking world in its interactions with Greek philosophy,
    Judaism, and the birth of Islam. Sebastian Brock in his comment
    on the cover notes that it is particularly helpful to have a
    book that shows how the Middle East and Europe were intimately
    related from a cultural point of view before the separation
    brought about by the Arab conquests. This investigation will
    actually contribute to four fields often still considered as
    unrelated: Syriac studies, the study of the reception of Greek
    philosophy into Syriac and Arabic, Rabbinics, and the study of
    Christianity in late antiquity.</p>

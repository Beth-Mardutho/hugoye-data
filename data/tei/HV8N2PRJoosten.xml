         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P1"/>[1] Using a
    translated text in textual criticism creates many
    complications: before any collation can be made, the translated
    text needs to be ‘retroverted’ into the original
    language; only then can questions of relative priority and
    textual history be addressed. Retroversion is hard to
    accomplish and always leaves a margin of doubt. The problem is
    particularly palpable in textual criticism of the Old
    Testament, where chance has it that some of the main textual
    witnesses—notably the Septuagint—are translations.
    In OT research, the need to establish the ‘translation
    technique’ characterizing a given textual unit is well
    recognized (although perhaps not universally applied). A large
    body of research on the translation technique of the Septuagint
    exists, comprehending both theoretical considerations and
    extensive studies of detail.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P2"/>[2] Textual
    criticism of the New Testament is relatively less dependent on
    versional evidence. Thousands of Greek manuscripts are
    attested, representing a wide variety of textual types and
    reaching back as far as the second century. Nevertheless, the
    ancient translations of the New Testament do have something to
    offer. The roots of the Latin and Syriac versions go back to
    the second century (although the manuscripts are not earlier
    than the fourth century, and transmit much material that is
    later than the second century). These two versions also attest,
    often jointly, many readings that are absent from the Greek
    tradition or extant only in a small group of manuscripts
    (notably the famous codex D).</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P3"/>[3] As in
    the field of OT textual criticism, so in the NT, caution should
    be observed in using the versions. A reading attested in a
    version is not equivalent to a reading in a Greek manuscript.
    In certain cases, an apparent variant in a version may go back
    to a Greek variant; but one can never entirely exclude the
    possibility that the variant was created during the process of
    translation. Many striking deviations in the versions have no
    other source than the linguistic or stylistic requirements of
    the target language. The present study by Peter Williams is
    devoted to the identification of such translational deviations
    in the Old Syriac and Peshitta versions of the Gospels. Where
    detailed research can establish that a certain type of
    variation regularly occurs in the Syriac versions, these
    versions may no longer be quoted as evidence for the said
    variation in Greek manuscripts.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P4"/>[4] A good
    example is provided by one of the first investigations offered
    in the book, the addition of the name Jesus (pp. 24-37). There
    is a noticeable tendency in both the Peshitta and Old Syriac to
    add this name where the Greek has a mere pronoun. For instance,
    in Matt 4:21, the Greek manuscripts read: “he called them
    (i.e., the sons of Zebedee)”, but the Curetonian Old
    Syriac reads: “Jesus called them”. Since this
    tendency is very marked, it is methodologically unsound to
    quote the Syriac versions in support of Greek manuscripts
    having the same addition. In Matt 8:3, “he touched
    him”, many Greek manuscripts read: “Jesus touched
    him”. The latter reading is found also in the Peshitta
    and the Old Syriac. Yet there is no way of knowing whether the
    Syriac versions reflect a Greek text having the addition of the
    proper noun (in which case they would count as textual
    evidence), or whether the addition of the name Jesus was made
    by the translators (in which case the Syriac reading lays no
    weight in the scales). In Williams’ study, the addition
    of the name Jesus is fully documented and extensively
    discussed, leaving little room for doubt as to the
    text-critical implications of the phenomenon.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P5"/>[5] In six
    chapters, many other phenomena are studied in the same detailed
    way: addition and omission of proper nouns, common nouns and
    pronouns; changes regarding articles, particles and adverbs;
    grammatical variants such as alteration in number, person,
    voice or tense; questions of word order; variations in words of
    speech, and miscellanea. Some brief “rules for the use of
    Syriac in NT textual criticism” are spelled out in
    appendix 1, while a second appendix lists a large number of
    suggested corrections to the apparatus of Nestle-Aland’s
    27<hi rend="sup">th</hi> edition of the NT text.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P6"/>[6] The book
    will be very useful for the small number of specialists whose
    business it is to produce critical editions of the NT text. One
    may expect future editions of Nestle-Aland’s <hi rend="italic">editio
    minor</hi> to omit a large number references to the Syriac
    versions. In a few cases, the elimination of the Syriac
    witnesses may change the balance of probability and lead to
    some adjustment in the establishment of the critical text.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P7"/>[7] For all
    those who are not into the composing of critical apparatuses of
    the gospel text, the usefulness of the book is less immediate.
    Indeed, the kind of textual phenomena treated in this work
    almost never have exegetical implications. Since the mere
    pronoun ‘he’ and the proper noun
    ‘Jesus’ clearly have the same referent in Matt 8:3,
    the interpretation of the passage will change little whichever
    reading is adopted. This is not to say Williams’ work is
    uninteresting. Much can be learnt on the workings of the Syriac
    language, on the attitude of the Syriac translators to their
    source, on the history of the text of the New Testament. But on
    all these points, the reader must go, so to say, beyond the
    limits the book has set itself.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P8"/>[8] Nowhere
    in this monograph is it stated explicitly that the
    text-critical value of the Syriac versions of the gospels is
    small. Nevertheless, by disqualifying so many readings attested
    in the Syriac, the argument may in the end raise doubts as to
    the very worth of these versions. It is only justice, then, to
    point out that many striking readings occurring in the Peshitta
    and, especially, in the Old Syriac gospels cannot, in fact, be
    accounted for simply by their translation technique. A good
    example is found in John 3:18, where the Sinaitic Old Syriac
    alone reads ‘the chosen son’ against the Greek
    manuscripts’ ‘the only son’. Being
    either unattested in the Greek tradition, or attested only in
    codex D, many of these readings are regarded with utmost
    suspicion by textual critics of the NT. Yet it would be right
    to restore them to our critical apparatuses, so as not to lose
    sight completely of the potential contribution of the versions
    to the history of the text of the New Testament.</p>

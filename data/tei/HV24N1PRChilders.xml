                <p xml:lang="en">In this study of late antique eastern baptismal rites and
                    mysta-gogy, Nathan Witkamp addresses the relationship between Narsai of
                    Nisibis and Theodore of Mopsuestia. Specifically, Witkamp tests
                    long-standing presumptions of Narsai’s heavy dependence on Theodore, showing
                    that whereas Narsai relies on received traditions, he in fact draws on a
                    broad Antiochene heritage, to which Theodore also belongs, synthesizing the
                    inherited material into a creative treatment distinctive to him and
                    reflective of his own East Syriac context.</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">Theodore’s influence on the East Syriac tradition is
                    well known. However, influential studies have read Narsai as offer-ing
                    little more than a nearly wooden adaptation of Theodore’s baptismal
                    rite—perhaps even to the point that Narsai obscured native aspects of the
                    East Syriac baptismal rite for the sake of promulgating Theodore’s version.
                    In this important contribution, Witkamp probes the connections between the
                    two, attempting to clarify the true nature of Theodore’s influence on
                    Narsai. The study identifies and explores the distinctive features of
                    Narsai’s rite and mystagogy, thereby putting the study of Narsai’s
                    presentation on a more secure footing in its own right and illuminating the
                    practice and theology of baptism in the late antique East Syriac context. </p>
                <p xml:lang="en">The introduction lays out the <hi rend="italic">status
                    quaestionis</hi>, surveying scholarship and introducing the two authors
                    and their relevant works. Witkamp defines the aims of his research,
                    characterizing his method as “a critical comparative approach,” and
                    contras-ting it with the typically “harmonizing” approach to be found in
                    much of the existing scholarship. The value of his approach is that it
                    allows each source and its respective context to retain greater integrity
                    than harmonizing approaches do. The latter tend to privilege either a
                    specific author or a hypothetical, supposedly original rite that tends
                    actually to be a composite, constructed partly from the sources and partly
                    from a scholar’s suppositions, shaped according to certain presumptions
                    regarding the development of early baptismal rites.</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">Witkamp also analyzes other eastern source material,
                    particularly where instances of similarity between Narsai and Theodore
                    occur, seeking to determine whether the similarities may be due to the
                    influence of the common Antiochene tradition or other sources (e.g., <hi
                        rend="italic">Didascalia Apostolorum</hi>, Aphrahat) rather than because
                    of Narsai’s dependence on Theodore. Yet Witkamp does not employ other
                    sources reductively, in order to propose a parallel source theory; instead,
                    their use conveys the complexities of the late antique contexts, reminding
                    the reader that we have only a very incomplete portrait of the historical
                    realities and that many of the influences on liturgy and mystagogy were not
                    literary at all, but oral and performative. Treating each author
                    independently, and comparing them critically rather than harmonistically
                    within the larger context of possible influences, gives Witkamp a more
                    secure vantage point from which to analyze their relationship.</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">The first main section of the book defines the late
                    antique authors’ terms and delineates the structures of their rites, while
                    sections two and three thoroughly explore the rituals before and during
                    baptism, respectively. Each part focuses on different aspects of the
                    subject, but the author constantly brings the reader back to his principal
                    concern: critically comparing and contrasting Narsai and Theodore in order
                    to detect and characterize their relationship.</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">The first main section focuses on terminology and
                    structure. A study of the sources’ baptismal vocabulary raises questions
                    about the view that the eastern baptismal rite consisted of three
                    functionally distinct parts: pre-baptismal rituals, baptism, and
                    post-baptismal rituals. Instead, the rite basically falls into two major
                    parts: “rituals preceding the mystery/ies” and “rituals of the mystery/ies.”
                    For both Theodore and Narsai, the post-baptismal rituals are largely
                    transitional and should not be distinguished functionally from the second
                    part of the rite. Witkamp provides helpful charts laying out the structures
                    of the rites, helping the reader visualize the results of his comparative
                    analysis, namely: the rites of Theodore and Narsai have important
                    similarities but are also notably different; furthermore, features of
                    Narsai’s version (especially the absence of post-baptismal rituals) mark it
                    as more conservative and less developed than Theodore’s. In other words, it
                    is better to see Narsai’s rite as more primitive developmentally than
                    Theodore’s, rather than derivative of it. </p>
                <p xml:lang="en">Having established some key differences between
                    Theodore’s and Narsai’s rites and anchored the latter firmly in the early
                    stages of the East Syriac tradition, the remaining two sections of the book
                    work through the rituals according to their basic division: 1) rituals
                    functionally prior to baptism and 2) rituals functionally accompanying
                    baptism. Each chapter describes specific aspects of ritual in the two
                    authors, discussing their functions and explaining their meanings for each.
                    The author is attentive to minute details of ritual structure, roles,
                    postures, gestures, and the like, insisting that these things together help
                    constitute the meanings of the rituals. A study of the rituals in relation
                    to other sources allows Witkamp to contextualize them before comparing
                    Narsai to Theodore and proposing conclusions about the relationship between
                    them in each case. Where there is insufficient data to draw clear
                    conclusions, especially about influence, Witkamp is quick to point that out,
                    exhibiting an intellectual modesty that invites the reader to become
                    comfortable with uncertainty.</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">Overall, the analyses of sections two and three confirm
                    the results of the preceding structural analyses: that both late antique
                    authors participate in the same eastern tradition but that Narsai’s rite is
                    not dependent on Theodore’s and is in fact often quite different,
                    representing an earlier East Syriac tradition instead. Narsai essentially
                    sticks to the rite he has inherited, which in turn distinguishes the
                    theological meanings of the rituals from those of Theodore. For instance,
                    the different positions and functions of the lawsuit or exorcism in each
                    author construct the baptizand differently just prior to the mystery.</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">Even if Narsai does not depend on Theodore’s rite, in
                    his mystagogy Narsai borrows from Theodore’s interpretations of the rite,
                    sometimes in straightforward ways, but often more creatively and adaptively.
                    Narsai’s symbolism tends to be richer than Theodore’s, as we might expect
                    from Ephrem’s heir, but also his theological emphases frequently strike
                    their own tones. Narsai puts more emphasis on baptism as re-creation than
                    Theodore; unlike Theodore, he depicts baptism as marriage and God as an
                    artist painting a new portrait on the waters. For Narsai, the story of the
                    prodigal son is a baptism narrative. At times, even where their language and
                    imagery are similar, as when they both draw on the notion of the baptismal
                    process as a fiery one heated by the Spirit, the meanings can diverge
                    significantly—Theodore pictures the baptismal font as a fiery potter’s kiln,
                    whereas for Narsai it is a furnace in which metal is reforged. </p>
                <p xml:lang="en">The book accomplishes its task, effectively testing the
                    connections between the two authors and showing that they both draw on a
                    common tradition, but that each practices somewhat different rites, and that
                    Narsai is no slavish imitator of the Bishop of Mopsuestia. There can be no
                    doubt that Narsai knew and used Theodore’s interpretations, but he did not
                    do so systematically and he often shows himself to be an independent and
                    creative theologian, at times reflecting the East Syriac heritage that we
                    find in other sources and at times seeming to convey his own ideas and
                    emphases. Narsai’s own context and East Syriac heritage provide simpler and
                    more convincing explanations of his treatment of baptism than do theories of
                    heavy reliance on Theodore.</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">The book is based on the author’s doctoral dissertation
                    and still bears the evidence of its origins as such. The reader will detect
                    some redundancies, especially in the summary portions. Chapter structures
                    and section titles can become repetitive, though they also attest to the
                    careful method the author follows throughout. The author relies fairly
                    heavily on translations and secondary sources. Some of the introductory
                    discussions may be too basic for some readers; other readers, however, will
                    appreciate the introductions to the persons of Narsai and Theodore and to
                    unfamiliar Syriac sources, finding the discussions of liturgical scholarship
                    helpfully orienting. In any case, the dissertation vestiges do not detract
                    at all from the important contribution this book makes to the study of
                    Theodore and especially of Narsai, and to our knowledge of late antique
                    eastern baptismal practices and theology. No longer can scholars presume
                    that Narsai merely relies on Theodore, nor that Narsai is not a worthy
                    representative of his native East Syriac tradition. Not only must scholars
                    reckon with Witkamp’s conclusions—the methods of his work should also inform
                    future comparative liturgical scholarship. Students of liturgy, patristic
                    scholars, church historians, and scholars of late antiquity will find the
                    book instructive and helpful.</p>

                <p xml:lang="en">Daniel King’s book The Earliest Syriac Translation of Aristotle’s
                    Categories may be considered the first critical edition of a Syriac translation of
                    Aristotle’s works. Thus, it raises a number of questions of textual criticism that
                    may be discussed against the background of D. Gutas’ research in the field of
                    Graeco-Arabic studies. This article provides a critical review of the book and a
                    description of the new online publication of the anonymous Syriac translation of
                    Aristotle’s Categories in the HUNAYNNET database.</p>

                not merely an edition of the earliest Syriac translation of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Categories</hi> (dating from the first half of the sixth century) supplied with
                an extensive commentary and glossaries. Given that the later versions of Jacob of
                Edessa and Georg of the Arabs were familiar with the anonymous translation, King’s
                analysis of all three versions resulted in a study of the transmission, revision,
                and reception of this part of Arisotle’s <hi rend="italic">Organon</hi> in the
                Syrian Orient. Apart from considering the afterlife of the published text, King drew
                on the large number of Syriac translations of Greek philosophical works made during
                the 5th and the 6th centuries, thus providing historical and scholarly background
                for the published text. All this makes his book a profound study of the reception of
                Aristotelian logic by Syriac scholars from the 5th to the 8th century.</p>
            <p xml:lang="en">More than that, King’s book turned out to be the first attempt at a critical edition
                of a Syriac version of Aristotle’s logical texts. All previous editions of this kind
                were mostly faithful reproductions of a particular manuscript that were mainly based

                which based on two manuscripts, may not be considered a proper critical edition
                since the result of his text-critical analysis was rather disappointing. Unlike his
                predecessors, King decided not simply to reproduce the only surviving witness of the
                anonymous translation of the <hi rend="italic">Categories</hi>, but to make an
                attempt at the reconstruction of the original version of this translation. By doing
                this, King lent impulse to discussion of the principles for publishing Syriac
                Aristotle, i.e. for the critical assessment of Syriac manuscript witnesses and their
                relation to the transmitted Greek texts and to their historical and cultural
                background.</p>
            <p xml:lang="en">In 2016, the team of the HUNAYNNET research project, which included the present
                author, started to prepare a set of digital editions of Syriac and Arabic
                translations from the Greek.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn8" n="8"><p

                At this point in time, the database also contains the anonymous Syriac translation
                of the <hi rend="italic">Categories</hi>. The original idea of representing King’s
                edition in digital form has been superseded by the decision to publish the text on
                the basis of the codex, in which it has been preserved. In what follows, I will try
                to explain to what extent and why the HUNAYNNET online version differs from the
                version of King. </p>

                <head>1. D. Gutas on the Principles of Textual Criticism</head>
                <p xml:lang="en">In his 2010 edition of the Greek and Arabic versions of
                    Theophrastus’ <hi rend="italic">On First Principles</hi> (or <hi rend="italic"
                        >Metaphysics</hi>), Dimitri Gutas included an excursus on the “principles of
                    Graeco-Arabic textual criticism and editorial technique”.<note place="foot"
                        xml:id="ftn9" n="9"><p rend="footnote text"> D. Gutas, <hi rend="italic"

                        77–159.</p></note> For the evaluation of an Arabic translation from the
                    Greek, Gutas suggested differentiating three stages of transmission: (1) The
                    preserved manuscripts containing the Arabic text that go back to (2) the
                    “translator’s autograph or clean copy”, which is itself based on (3) a certain
                    Greek exemplar of the text.</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">While (1) is the preserved witness that may serve as the basis of the edition,
                    (2) and (3) are usually no longer extant. Thus, the purpose of the scholar is to
                    take his edition as closely as possible to (2) and, further, to use (2) to
                    establish the tenor of (3). In proceeding from (1) to (2), the editor can draw
                    not only on the extant copies of the Arabic translation, but also on the
                    received Greek text, which in many cases may serve as an important witness in
                    establishing the original readings in Arabic.</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">The analysis of the Arabic translation aims not only at detecting the Greek text
                    behind it (for which Gutas uses the siglum Ψ),<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn10"
                        n="10"><p rend="footnote text"> And Ψ* for the corrections to the Greek text

                            p. 95.</p></note> but also at disclosing the way in which the translator

                            manifestly due to the vicissitudes of transmission from one Arabic

                    Graeco-Arabic apparatus. However, in many cases the cause of disparities between
                    the Arabic and Greek versions remains indeterminable; but because they may be of
                    possible interest to the editor of the Greek text if they reflect a variant
                    Greek text, they are noted in the Greek apparatus with the abbreviation “Ar.” or
                    “Arab.” for the editor to evaluating. In other cases, some disparities may be
                    understood as products of the reception and interpretation of the Greek text
                    within the context of the Arabic tradition, in which cases Gutas suggests the
                    characteristic “ut intell. Arab.” (as understood by the translator) and “ut.
                    interpr. Arab.” (as interpreted by the translator).<note place="foot"

                    editions of Syriac translations from the Greek. King’s publication of the
                    anonymous Syriac version of Aristotle’s <hi rend="italic">Categories</hi>
                    (hereafter “Anon”) may be considered an attempt to apply them to Syriac
                    material. Though King was not familiar with Gutas’ edition of Theophrastus (both
                    books appeared in the same year 2010), he seems to have had the same aim in
                    mind. In the short note on “principles of the present edition”, the editor
                    writes: “Within the limits of the possible, I have tried to give the text as it
                    came off the desk of the translator himself, retaining all his own errors while
                    emending all errors that are clearly attributable to a later copyist within the
                    Syriac tradition”.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn15" n="15"><p

                <p xml:lang="en">Thus, King suggested to differentiate the three stages of the transmission
                    process, trying (a) by making conjectural emendations of the existing witnesses
                    to come as close as possible to (b) the translator’s autograph and on the basis
                    of the latter to analyze (c) the Greek version behind it. In the case of Anon,
                    we have only one extant manuscript, the famous BL Add. 14658.<note place="foot"

                    character of this dependence remains unclear, for in spite of numerous
                    similarities between the three versions there are a number of characteristics in
                    J and G that make them different from Anon. King, nevertheless, calls J and G
                    “revisions” of Anon,<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn18" n="18"><p

                <head>2. Two Difficult Points: A/A* and the Relation of Anon to J and G</head>
                <p xml:lang="en">Two questions seem to remain not quite clarified in King’s
                    analysis and these two points may potentially lead the reader of the book to
                    confusion — first, in the reconstruction of the translator’s autograph, and,
                    following from this, in the analysis of the supposed Greek exemplar used by the
                    translator:</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">1) The relation of the preserved textual evidence of the translation (as it
                    stands in the manuscript) to the translator’s autograph, i.e. the relation
                    between Stages 1 and 2 by Gutas.</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">2) The relation between Anon, on the one hand, and J and G, on the other, that
                    may cause a misreading of the transition from Stage 2 to Stage 3 by Gutas, i.e.
                    in establishing the Greek variants behind Anon.</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">The first problem appears at the formal level. King uses two sigla to refer to
                    Anon: “A” referring to the translator’s assumed original (cf. p. 170: “anonymous
                    version as printed in this volume”; p. 257: “assumed original”), and “A*”
                    referring to the manuscript (cf. p. 257: “as extant in BL Add. 14658”). The
                    siglum A*, however, is only introduced for the first time on p. 257, so that up
                    to this point it is siglum A that combines both meanings. For example, on p.
                    178, King notes that “A has <foreign xml:lang="syr">ܠܐ ܡܫܟܚܐ</foreign> ”, and
                    this is the variant found in the manuscript (i.e. in A*), while King amends it
                    to <foreign xml:lang="syr">ܡܕܡ ܟܠܐ</foreign> , the
                    variant that should properly be designated as A. Later on, on p. 259, King
                    comments on the same passage, attributing this time the reading <foreign xml:lang="syr">ܠܐ ܡܫܟܚܐ</foreign> to A*. But
                    since before p. 257 King does not distinguish the two sigla, A is made to stand
                    for both, and this lack of clarity between (Gutas’) Stages 1 and 2 may lead a
                    reader to confusion in the analysis of Stage 3, i.e. of the presumed Greek
                    original. E.g., on p. 212 we read: “6b36-7 [80vb] A omits any equivalent for
                    δόξει.” Since A remains undifferentiated on these pages, it is unclear whether
                    the commentary refers to the state of the manuscript (i.e. A*) or to that of the
                    translator’s copy (i.e. A).</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">The second problem stems from the assumption that J and G were not only familiar
                    with the version of Anon, but should be considered “revisions” of it. On the one
                    hand, this conclusion could provide further help with reconstructing the
                    translator’s version of Anon. On the other hand, the use of J and G in the
                    analysis of the characteristics of Anon and of the Greek text behind it conceals
                    the danger to assess J and G as mere witnesses of the text of Anon, rather than
                    as versions of their own.</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">In several instances, King demonstrates close similarity between the three
                    versions (though there are small details that still make them different), which
                    he interprets as proof of the “influence” of Anon on J and G, and of “an evident
                    line of continuity among the versions”<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn19" n="19"

                    However, what is the character of this influence and what is the nature of this
                    continuity? In other words, what was the purpose of both Jacob and George in
                    “revising” the text of Anon?</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">In his analysis of the relation between Anon, J and G, King does not dwell on the
                    question of the Greek <hi rend="italic">Vorlage</hi> behind J and G, although
                    this question seems to be of crucial importance for our understanding of the
                    relation between the versions. If we consider J and G to be the “revisions” of
                    Anon, this brings us to the question whether they ultimately go back to the same
                    Greek text as Anon or do they reflect work carried out on Greek manuscripts
                    other than the supposed basis of Anon?</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">On p. 84, King remarks that “G must have had his own Greek ms.”,<note

                    between the three versions in the commentary to the text corroborates this
                    thesis. However, given that Anon, J and G go back to different Greek mss, but at
                    the same time J and G demonstrate familiarity with Anon, should not Anon rather

                <p xml:lang="en">Anon, J, and G suggest different approaches to the Greek text that reflect
                    different translation strategies. In rendering the Greek term ὁμώνυμα, the three
                    versions share the same term <foreign xml:lang="syr">ܫܘ̈ܝܝ ܫܡܐ</foreign> . But,
                    while Anon and J first transliterate it (J’s form <foreign xml:lang="syr">ܐܡܘ̈ܢܡܐ</foreign> seems to be
                    closer to the Greek) and then further explain its meaning, G prefers to adhere
                    to the received Greek text. The adverb μόνον in the same phrase remains
                    untranslated in Anon, but it is present in both J and G. The word τὸ γεγραμμένον
                    is rendered as <foreign xml:lang="syr">ܗ̇ܘ
                        ܕܨܝܪ</foreign> in both Anon and G, while J prefers to use the feminine form <foreign xml:lang="syr">ܗ̇ܝ ܕܨܝܪܐ</foreign> to
                    reflect the neuter. Both Anon and J seem to have difficulties in understanding
                    the position and meaning of the phrase τὸ <foreign xml:lang="gr">ζῴῳ</foreign> εἶναι in the last sentence, but G
                    suggests a translation that is close to the received Greek text.</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">To sum up, J and G are not <hi rend="italic">based</hi> on Anon as on their main
                    source, but rather should be considered independent translations of the Greek
                    that <hi rend="italic">were familiar</hi> with Anon and <hi rend="italic">made
                        use</hi> of it as of an additional tool in understanding the Aristotelian
                    text. If this notion is correct, then J and G should be used with great caution
                    in understanding the transition from (Gutas’) Stage 1 to Stage 2, i.e. in
                    reconstructing the translator’s autograph, and subsequently, in moving to Stage
                    3, i.e. in establishing the Greek text behind Anon. Strictly speaking, we have
                    no criteria for establishing whether a supposedly “good” variant reading
                    preserved in J and G goes back to Anon and not to the translation activity of
                    Jacob and George.</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">It seems that this differentiation between the Greek <hi rend="italic"
                        >Vorlage</hi> of Anon on the one hand and the Greek text behind J and G on
                    the other is not clear, although the editor himself seems to be well aware of
                        it.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn24" n="24"><p rend="footnote text"> Cf.
                            note 21 above.</p></note> What a reader of the book finds is a
                    combination of the analysis of Anon with that of J and G, which makes an
                    impression (most likely not intended by the editor of the book) that J and G are
                    mere witnesses of the Syriac text of Anon together with the codex that has
                    preserved Anon for us.</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">King offers two kinds of explanations to the published text: first, the
                    “Commentary” on his Syriac edition, and second, the “Textual Notes” that contain
                    the Syriac-Greek critical apparatus. J and G appear as important evidence both
                    in the “Commentary” and in the “Notes”. The “Notes” have a subtitle: “Commentary
                    on the anonymous version of the <hi rend="italic">Categories</hi> together with
                    comparative notes on the versions of Jacob of Edessa and George of the Arabs”.
                    The subtitle shows that the editor was eager to make a distinction between Anon
                    and J &amp; G, so that the latter versions were originally consulted for the
                    purpose of comparison. Whatever the original intention of the editor was, it
                    seems that the outcome of his analysis was such close association between the
                    three versions, which does not allow for the reader to distinguish between their
                    witnesses both in the analysis of A/A* and in reconstructing the Greek text
                    behind it.</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">In the “Textual Notes”, this distinction seems to disappear even more. Here, the
                    editor states that his goal would be to discuss not only “textual matters
                    relating to the Greek <hi rend="italic">Vorlage</hi> of A” (i.e. Anon), but also
                    “a variety of other issues relating to the corruption of the present text of A
                    as we have it, and its relationship to J and G”.<note place="foot"

                    Though these two points are proclaimed as different objectives, they turn out to
                    be so closely connected in the following notes that the reader has little chance
                    to differentiate them. As a result, one easily gains an impression (which was
                    obviously not envisioned as such by the editor of the book) that J and G were
                    used to reconstruct the “translator’s autograph” in the “Commentary” and that
                    later on, the comparison between the “reconstructed” Anon, J and G turns out to
                    be much more dependent on the evidence of J and G, than to reflect the text of
                    Anon.</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">Additional difficulty in the commentary part of the book (i.e. both in the
                    “Commentary” and the “Textual Notes”) comes in the system of references. The
                    commentaries refer to the Bekker numbers and not to the page and line numbers of
                    the Syriac edition. This makes the localization of a particular passage
                    sometimes a difficult task for the reader, given that only every fifth Bekker
                    number appears in the margins of the Syriac text. This principle of organization
                    applied to the commentary part by King creates a number of difficulties for
                    readers who do not have the Greek text of the <hi rend="italic">Categories</hi>
                    in front of them, and it seems to reflect the editor’s intention to provide
                    access to the Syriac version for a specialist of the Greek text of the <hi
                        rend="italic">Categories</hi>.</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">It is also an interesting coincidence that the structure of the English
                    translation of the Syriac text matches nearly completely with the structure of
                    Ackrill’s English translation of the <hi rend="italic">Categories</hi> from the
                    Greek and thus does not reflect any elements of the internal organization of the
                    Syriac version. Rather, it makes an impression that the primary goal of the
                    English translation of the Syriac text of Anon would be to serve as an appendix
                    for the Greek text.</p>

                    King’s edition does not always provide sufficient information on “what is
                    known”. This turned out to be the main reason why the online edition of the Anon
                    in the HUNAYNNET is not based on King’s edition, but rather on the BL codex,
                    containing it.</p>

                    it is not quite clear whether a seemingly erroneous variant in the text is
                    really an error or an extravagant variant of translation, it seems that a more
                    secure way of dealing with this question would have been carefully to have
                    recorded all the changes to the text and to allow the reader to analyze these, a
                    principle that is maintained in the HUNAYNNET online edition of the text.</p>

                    denote the additions made to the text of the manuscript (hereafter: “ms”). The
                    supplementary elements have simply been inserted into the main text of the
                    edition, and in some cases their presence is explained in the critical apparatus

                <p xml:lang="en">98.8 The addition of <foreign xml:lang="syr"
                        >ܣܘܣܝܐ</foreign> is necessary because the preserved Syriac text is otherwise not

                        >ܦܠܢܝܬ</foreign> is a good solution, since it makes a minor correction to the
                    transmitted text and takes it closer to the Greek.</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">110.11 The correction <foreign xml:lang="syr"
                        >ܕܓܘܐ</foreign> to <foreign xml:lang="syr"
                        >ܕܓܘܢܐ</foreign> is necessary and it better reflects the Greek.</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">110.26 The same stands for the correction of <foreign xml:lang="syr">ܒܙܒܢܐ</foreign> to <foreign xml:lang="syr">ܒܙܢܐ</foreign>. The variant
                    in the ms can easily be explained as a scribal error and the emendation brings
                    the text closer to the Greek.</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">112.10 The correction <foreign xml:lang="syr"
                        >ܕܒܚܫܐ</foreign> takes the text closer to the Greek, and the form <foreign xml:lang="syr">ܒܢܝܫܐ</foreign> is a clear

                        >ܐܚܪܬܐ</foreign> seems to be necessary, for otherwise the Syriac text remains
                    incomprehensible. The second correction (<foreign xml:lang="syr">ܗܟܢܐ</foreign> to <foreign xml:lang="syr">ܚܕܐ</foreign>) looks more
                    problematic, for in the preserved form the Syriac makes sense and could simply
                    reflect the translators’ method of rendering the Greek.</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">To sum up, the listed corrections are necessary and were inserted into the main
                    text of the HUNAYNNET edition because:</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">1) the Syriac text makes no sense in its present state in the ms;</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">2) the correction requires a minimal change of Syriac, and it can be explained by
                    an error in the transmission of the Syriac text;</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">3) it is mostly based on the transmitted Greek text.</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">However, not all the editor’s corrections introduced into the main text of the
                    edition find sufficient support among the extant witnesses. As noted above, in
                    his reconstruction of the translator’s autograph, King seemingly makes active
                    use of J and G, though they may not be considered as “improved” copies of Anon,
                    but rather as independent translations.</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">A number of conjunctions seem to be rather far-fetched, and the reason for them
                    turns out to be the idea that the translator should have faithfully rendered the
                    received Greek text. However, Anon remains generally unstable in its use of
                    terminology and translation technique (cf. below, §4). As King stresses on p.
                    33, Anon “experiments extensively, makes frequent errors, and often
                    misunderstands the original…” Cf. p. 198: the translation technique of Anon is
                    “changing within a single passage”. These characteristics make the analysis of
                    Anon extremely complex, for a variant that looks like an error may in fact be
                    attributable to this changing technique.</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">In many cases, the corrections of the received Syriac text seem to be based on an
                    idea of how the Syriac translator <hi rend="italic">should have translated</hi>
                    the Greek original. This “should” reflects a modern concept of an editor who
                    thus reconstructs the text of the translation, but in many cases does not make
                    apparent the reasons for his choice. Many such corrections intending to improve
                    the work of the Syriac translator are not based on any clear evidence. For
                    example:</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">98.11 <foreign xml:lang="syr">ܡܫܟܚܐ</foreign> ms : <foreign xml:lang="syr">ܡܕܡ ܟܠܐ</foreign> ed. — On p.
                    178, the editor explains his conjunction by stating that “A’s text reverses
                    Aristotle’s meaning”. This statement suggests implicitly that the preserved
                    Syriac version contains a certain interpretation that does not match with the
                    transmitted Greek text.</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">104.26 <foreign xml:lang="syr">ܐܢܐ</foreign> ms : <foreign xml:lang="syr">ܐܢܬ</foreign> ed. — The
                    editor’s variant is based on the fact that the transmitted Greek text has 2nd
                    person sg. However, it remains possible that the Syriac translator 1) had
                    another variant in his Greek copy, or 2) preferred to change it for some
                    reason.</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">104.33 <foreign xml:lang="syr">ܐܘ̈ܣܝܣ</foreign> ms :
                        <foreign xml:lang="syr">ܕܐܘ̈ܣܝܣ</foreign> ed. —
                    The editor’s correction is again based on the assumption that the Syriac
                    translator was trying to render the transmitted Greek text in a way that would
                    be close to the Greek. In the commentary on p. 186, King suggests that Anon
                    renders the Greek in a different way to J and G. This note does not make clear
                    why the main text of the edition contains the emendation and not the original
                    reading of the ms, which also makes sense although it departs from the
                    transmitted Greek version.</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">106.10 <foreign xml:lang="syr">ܦܘܪܫܐ</foreign> ms :
                        <foreign xml:lang="syr">ܦܘܪܫܢܐ</foreign> ed. —
                    The editor doesn’t explain his emendation, but one may suppose that it is due to
                    the fact that the term <foreign xml:lang="syr"
                        >ܦܘܪܫܢܐ</foreign> is used more frequently in Anon. However, given that Anon is
                    not consistent in its terminology, the possibility that another term was applied
                    here should not be excluded.</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">106.24 The insertion of <foreign xml:lang="syr"

                        >ܐܘܣܝܐ</foreign> is clearly following the Greek text (cf. the commentary on p.
                    188), though the sentence would make sense without it. It is not unusual for
                    Syriac to stress a term by putting it in front position in a sentence. Cf. a
                    similar case in 106.26, where the particle <foreign xml:lang="syr">ܕ</foreign> is attached. Both
                    instances coming in close proximity speaks rather in favor of a particular style
                    of translation rather than a series of errors.</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">110.11 The change from the simple <foreign xml:lang="syr">ܗܘ</foreign> to <foreign xml:lang="syr">ܗܘ ܟܕ ܗܘ</foreign> in
                    rendering the Greek ταὐτόν is based on two assumptions: (1) “a later copyist has
                    omitted <foreign xml:lang="syr">ܗܘ ܟܕ ܗܘ</foreign>
                    through homoeoteleuton” (p. 192), and (2) “as the translator has by this point
                    learnt how to render this expression [i.e. <foreign xml:lang="syr">ܗܘ ܟܕ ܗܘ</foreign> for ταὐτόν
                    — <hi rend="italic">Y.A</hi>.] effectively, the error can be assumed to be a
                    copyist’s”. Yet on closer examination, neither of these arguments seems to be
                    decisive in a way that would necessitate a change in the main text of the
                    edition. Especially, the second argument about the skills of the translator in
                    following the pattern most common in Syriac translations is not decisive, as is
                    made clear by the note on p. 33 (see above). Thus, it remains a possibility that
                    (1) the singular <foreign xml:lang="syr">ܗܘ</foreign>
                    is the original variant used by the translator to translate the Greek ταὐτόν,
                    and (2) there was some other Greek word in the copy which the Syriac translator
                    made use of.</p>

                        >ܡܢ</foreign> into the main text (the variant of ms is indicated as “om.”) aims
                    at a better rendering of the Greek genitive. Cf. the commentary on p. 266:
                    “Required for sense, cf. JG”. As in many other cases, the editor seems to have
                    used the evidence of J and G as witnesses to the original version of Anon,
                    though both Jacob and George could have corrected Anon for the same reason as
                    King, and it remains a possibility that Anon was not consistent and modified the
                    Greek original. Without <foreign xml:lang="syr"
                        >ܡܢ</foreign>, the Syriac text would be an instance of <hi rend="italic"
                        >apposition</hi> (see Nöldeke, §212), which would render the expression
                    <foreign xml:lang="gr">τούτων δὲ</foreign> without using some equivalent for the genitive.</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">118.6 Here the editor makes a series of corrections, and one becomes the
                    justification for another. The ms runs as follows: <foreign xml:lang="syr">ܠܘܬ ܝܬܗ ܕܝܢ ܪܒܐ ܘܙܥܘܪܐ
                        ܠܐ ܡܬܐܡܪ ܠܓܡܪ</foreign> , which could be translated: “By themselves, small and
                    large are not said” (see p. 204). This is not in line with the argument of
                    Aristotle as transmitted in the Greek text. This seems to be the only reason for
                    the editor’s change to the Syriac text, first by eliminating the negative
                    particle <foreign xml:lang="syr">ܠܐ</foreign> and
                    then by introducing <foreign xml:lang="syr"
                        >ܐܢ</foreign> at the beginning of the clause. However, the transmitted Syriac
                    text may reflect the original variant of the translator.</p>

                    Commenting on this passage on p. 204, King notes that “<foreign xml:lang="gr">ὥστε</foreign> in A is usually <foreign xml:lang="syr">ܐܝܟܢܐ</foreign> or <foreign xml:lang="syr">ܡܕܝܢ</foreign>, but here the
                    more idiomatic <foreign xml:lang="syr">ܡܢ
                        ܗܕܐ</foreign> ”. Apart from the ambiguous meaning of “A” (does it designate the
                    translator or the manuscript version?), it remains unclear why this unique “more
                    idiomatic” use of <foreign xml:lang="syr">ܡܢ
                        ܗܕܐ</foreign> should be corrected in the main text and not in the critical

                        >ܠܘܬ</foreign> remains unexplained by the editor, and it seems to be based on the
                    assumption that the Greek πρός should be translated only by <foreign xml:lang="syr">ܠܘܬ</foreign>. But since the
                    Syriac translator is not always consistent, the unique use of <foreign xml:lang="syr">ܠܦܘܬ</foreign> as an
                    equivalent to πρός is not completely impossible, and it seems better to have the

                    rendering of the Greek. The editor admits this on p. 268, noting that the
                    version preserved in the ms “is not a very successful translation”. Such an
                    evaluation does not necessarily demand a conjunction that is based on J and

                    be present at 164.3, which would refer to 15a1. It seems that in both cases such
                    an explanation is far-fetched. In the latter, <foreign xml:lang="syr">ܐܢ</foreign> may just express
                    both the optative and the particle ἄν. And in the former, the conjunction <foreign xml:lang="syr">ܐܘ</foreign> would also be

                    correction to <foreign xml:lang="syr">ܗܘܝܐ</foreign>
                    is evidently a good solution. Much less understandable is the correction of the

                        >ܒܪܫܝܬܗ</foreign>), which looks like a good rendering of the Greek εὐθύς. King
                    understands it as “through the wickedness (of matter)”, which he considers as
                    “evidence for the religious mentality of the scribe, who sees what he expects in
                    the text before him rather than what is written”. This judgment seems to be
                    rather harsh given that the text remains on the whole quite close to the

                    Greek form different from the transmitted text; and (2) it contains the

                    is likely based on the fact that the Greek has <foreign xml:lang="gr">ἢ ὕστερόν</foreign>, and a more correct

                    the modern editor is correcting not the errors of textual transmission, but
                    rather the Syriac translator of the 6th century.</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">These and some additional editorial interventions in the text appear not in the
                    critical apparatus or in the commentaries coming after the text, but in the
                    published text itself. Most of these emendations and changes appear without any
                    marker in the parallel English translation (and they further serve as a basis
                    for the reconstruction of the Greek exemplar used by the Syriac translator). For
                    example, on p. 139 the words “honey is” are included in square brackets in the
                    English translation, which is correct, as they have indeed been added to the
                    text. However, the beginning of the next sentence, “in the same way”, is also an
                    addition, but it is not marked as such by means of brackets. Later on, in the
                    last paragraph on the same page, the first sentence also includes an addition,
                    “(difficult) to move”, which is also not marked as such, so that a reader could
                    have an impression that these words are present in the Syriac text.</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">The parallel English translation of the published Syriac text thus includes most
                    of the editor’s conjectures, most of which have not been marked by means of
                    &lt;…&gt; (see, e.g., the insertion of <foreign xml:lang="syr">ܡܩܒܠܐ</foreign> in 118.20).
                    Instead, the additions appear in the main text, while the critical apparatus
                    informs us that the added elements are “omitted” by Anon. In many cases, it
                    remains unclear whether such “omissions” derive from the Greek exemplar, the
                    work of the Syriac translator, or the transmission of the Syriac text.</p>

                <head>5. The Context of Anon</head>
                <p xml:lang="en">There is a certain paradox connected with the anonymous
                    Syriac version of Aristotle’s <hi rend="italic">Categories</hi> that becomes
                    apparent from the book of King. On the one hand, Anon turns out to be a highly
                    unstable version that frequently changes its use of terminology and translation
                    technique; its author (or authors) seems frequently to have had difficulties in
                    grasping the precise meaning of the Aristotelian text; and it seems to be
                    possibly based on an imperfect copy of the Greek text. On the other hand, this
                    version must have had a great impact on the Syriac philosophical tradition, for
                    such experts in the Greek language and in Aristotelian philosophy as Jacob of
                    Edessa and George Bishop of the Arabs found it necessary to take Anon into
                    account and to use the terminology coined by this version.</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">It would, thus, be natural to deduce that the authority of Anon lay not in the
                    authority of the person or persons who produced it, but rather in the
                    authoritative <hi rend="italic">tradition</hi>, part of which and a product of
                    which this translation was. It seems to reflect the continuous pedagogical
                    tradition of study, translation, and commentary of the first and most important
                    part of the Aristotelian <hi rend="italic">Organon</hi> in Syriac schools in the
                    period before that, in which the teachers of Qenneshre, Jacob of Edessa and
                    George of the Arabs, replaced it with other, more precise translations. In doing
                    this, however, they saw it necessary to preserve as much as possible of Anon and
                    its terminology.</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">The educational background of Anon seems to infiltrate the text in the passage
                    that renders <hi rend="italic">Cat</hi>. 13a23-25: <foreign xml:lang="gr">ὁ γὰρ φαῦλος εἰς βελτίους

                    proposes the following translation: <foreign xml:lang="syr">ܒܝܫܐ ܓܝܪ ܟܕ ܒܡ̈ܠܐ

                    he is answered in good words, even if only a little, progresses towards being
                    good.” The Syriac translator preferred to render the text in a more moral way,
                    having probably in mind numerous apophthegms about Greek sages who preferred to
                    answer evil deeds with good words, apophthegms that formed part of the
                    elementary education of the young.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn29" n="29"><p

                    elaborated on this topic: <foreign xml:lang="syr">ܒܝܫܐ ܓܝܪ ܟܕ ܠܕܘܝܪܐ

                    certainly sounds like the monastic way of life.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn30"

                    background of Anon, which turns out to be the outcome of the pedagogical
                    tradition in Syriac monastic schools, rather than the effect of one
                    translator.</p>

                    emerged from a long pedagogical tradition that included oral instruction and the
                    use of commentaries and scholia rather than representing a purely individual
                    attempt at translation. However, more accurate translations of Jacob of Edessa
                    and of George of the Arabs later replaced the earlier version, so that it is not
                    surprising that only this one textual witness has come down to us.</p>

                    also offers valuable new data. For his edition of Anon, King has made a new
                    collation of the mss of this version that were available to him and published an
                    extensive critical apparatus. King made use of the following mss: Vat. Syr. 158

                <p xml:lang="en">1) Mss M, B, and P belong to the same branch of transmission, as they share a
                    large number of errors and textual variants not present in V and C.
                    Additionally, B and P share a number of errors not present in M, and must thus
                    go back to a common intermediary copy.</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">2) Ms M is a direct copy of ms Baghdad, Chaldean Monastery 169, <hi rend="italic"
                        >olim</hi> Notre Dome des Semences 51, which was inaccessible to me but
                    could replace M in the stemma.</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">3) Two other mss from the same collection were not available to me: Baghdad,
                    Chaldean Monastery 171, <hi rend="italic">olim</hi> Notre Dame des Semences 52,
                    and Notre Dame des Semences 53. Their place in the stemma should be clarified in
                    the future.</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">4) W, in being a direct copy of V, may be excluded from the critical apparatus.
                    Three apographs of V are known: Paris, BnF, Syriac 248 (W), Escorial Or. 652,
                    and Florence, Palat. Med. Or. 176. Among this group of manuscripts, W holds a
                    special position, and variants from this codex appear in the critical apparatus
                    of the HUNAYNNET edition due to two characteristics. First, Georr used it in his
                    edition of Jacob of Edessa’s version of the <hi rend="italic">Categories</hi>,
                    and analysis of the variants from W make clear, which of Georr’s readings derive
                    from W and which are due to the editor. And secondly, W emerges not as a
                    mechanical copy of V. On fol. 49v, line 5, V omits a large portion of text
                    corresponding to 285.12–14 in Georr’s edition. However, this text is present in
                    W, and it is not the only example of this kind<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn33"
                        n="33"><p rend="footnote text"> V omits a large portion of text of
                            Porphyry’s <hi rend="italic">Eisagoge</hi> on fol. 3v, lines 22–23, that
                            is present in W.</p></note>. Just before this, a large passage is absent
                    from W (= 284.2 <foreign xml:lang="syr"
                        >ܗܟܢܐ</foreign> — 285.11 <foreign xml:lang="syr"
                            >ܡܬܐܡܪܝܢ</foreign> Georr), and the lacuna comprises precisely two pages of text
                    in V (fols. 48v–49r), i.e. the scribe of W seemingly turned one additional page
                    without noticing it. Given this evidence, there remains little doubt that W was
                    copied from V, however the presence of the text in W missing from V permits us
                    to suppose that the scribe of W used additional sources for his work (a possible
                    candidate for which may be P).</p>

                    Aristotelian text between these passages is quoted inconsistently, and certain
                    portions of it are omitted. On the basis of the quoted passages, it remains
                    difficult to assign C to a place in the stemma. However, King’s notion that C
                    shares an error with V (in the passage corresponding to 272.20 Georr) is not
                    correct, since V in fact does not contain the form that King is quoting. On the
                    contrary, in one passage (273.10–11 Georr, see fol. 6v in C) C contains the
                    variant reading (<foreign xml:lang="syr"
                        >ܕܡܬܪܓܫܢܐ</foreign>), which is found in mss BMP, but not in V. However, this
                    seems to be insufficient grounds for placing C within the BMP line, and thus C
                    assumes a special place in the stemma.</p>

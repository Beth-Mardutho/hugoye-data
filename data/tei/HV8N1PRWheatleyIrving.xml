         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P1"/>[1] <hi rend="italic">In
    the Lands of the Christians,</hi> by Nabil Matar<ref target="#FN1">1</ref> offers the first
    English translations of four seventeenth-century travel
    narratives originally written in Arabic. Of special
    importance to students of Middle Eastern history is the fact
    that these texts are about travel to the countries of Europe
    and South America, while readers of <hi rend="italic">Hugoye</hi> will find
    particularly interesting the selection by Ilyas b. Hanna
    al-Mawsuli, a Chaldean Catholic priest (later, bishop) of
    Baghdad. In this review, I wish to focus first on Matar’s
    introductory essay, which views the travel writings of Ilyas b.
    Hanna and the other authors from the perspective of current
    academic historical and Middle East studies. Secondly, I wish
    to look at Ilyas b. Hanna’s narrative more closely, and
    suggest another possible way of contextualizing his
    travels.<ref target="#FN2">2</ref>
         </p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P2"/>[2] The
    collection opens with a substantial essay, introducing the
    travel narratives and explaining why the theme is of
    interest. At thirty-five pages and almost one hundred
    endnotes, it reads like the outline of a course that I would
    love to take. Matar specifically confronts a notion
    espoused most strongly by Bernard Lewis and in turn cited by
    many others, namely that Muslims of the Middle Ages were
    completely lacking in “curiosity” towards
    Europeans.<ref target="#FN3">3</ref> The response of the late Edward Said, who
    suspected that Lewis’ book was written as a riposte to
    his own <hi rend="italic">Orientalism</hi> published just a few years
    earlier, was to wonder how Lewis could feel that knowledge
    about Europe was “the only acceptable criterion for true
    knowledge.”<ref target="#FN4">4</ref> Matar’s response is to fill in the
    silence from which Lewis and his followers argue.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P3"/>[3] The
    theme of exploration and travel writing is already quite
    familiar to students of the early modern to modern history of
    the Middle East and elsewhere; however, Matar argues that his
    Arab authors can be distinguished from the bulk of
    contemporary, European-based travel writers:</p>
         <quote>
      The travelers did not frame their encounter with the
      Europeans within the “particular myths, visions and
      fantasies” that characterize many (if not necessarily
      all) European texts. The Arabic travel accounts cannot
      therefore be approached through the theoretical models with
      which European accounts have been studied by writers as
      different as Stephen Greenblatt, Edward Said, and Gayatri
      Spivak. They belong to a tradition that is different not
      only in its history but in its epistemology: the
      travelers were not harbingers of an Islamic imperialism
      compelled to alterize and to present, in the words of Mary
      Louise Pratt, the “redundancy, discontinuity, and
      unreality” of the Christians. Rather, they wrote
      empirical accounts about Europe with the same precision that
      many of their coreligionists used to describe their journeys
      within the world of Islam, and in the case of the Christian
      travelers, within the world at large. Furthermore, and
      unlike the European travelers who used classical or biblical
      sources as their guides, the Arabs did not have previous
      models with which to compare or contrast Europe and
      America. They went with an open mind and a clean
      slate. And even when a traveler such as al-Ghassani went
      with anger and antipathy—repeatedly denouncing the
      <hi rend="italic">nasara</hi> for having expelled his forefathers and
      coreligionists from Spain—he still admitted, on the
      first page of his account, that he had kept himself open to
      the wonders and innovations of the <hi rend="italic">nasara.</hi> (p.
      xxxii, nn. 75-77.)
    </quote>
         <p>One might question the “open mind and clean
    slate” of Matar’s authors, since it is axiomatic in
    literary studies today that no author ever “starts from
    scratch.”  However, it is impossible not to notice
    the difference in tone between the selection of travel
    narratives that Matar presents, and many of those discussed by
    Mary Louise Pratt, which were written in the mid-eighteenth to
    nineteenth centuries.<ref target="#FN5">5</ref> But here, as Matar admits, the issue
    of timing is crucial: “The seventeenth century visitors
    belonged to an Islamic society that appeared as powerful and as
    wealthy as the society of Europe. Neither Muslim nor
    Christian was put on the cultural or historical defensive
    during his European journey.”<ref target="#FN6">6</ref> Similarly, it would be
    anachronistic to suppose that the recollections of a Briton
    traveling or living in the Ottoman world in the seventeenth
    century would be characterized by the imperialism of the
    nineteenth century.<ref target="#FN7">7</ref> In the seventeenth century, attitudes
    and boundaries had not hardened.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P4"/>[4]
    Matar’s particular topic—Arab (or Muslim, or
    Ottoman subject; it almost does not matter) knowledge of Europe
    and Europeans—can easily be seen to be a response to a
    larger theme, represented in both academic and non-academic
    works, whereby the achievements of peoples of the Islamic world
    are held up to those of Europe’s, and found
    lacking. A very brief search in the library netted the
    next two examples of responses. Perhaps a more popular
    sub-theme is the purported decline of mediaeval Islamic
    science, especially astronomy. In a lengthy review of Toby
    E. Huff’s <hi rend="italic">The Rise of Early Modern
    Science: Islam, China and the West</hi> (Cambridge
    University Press, 1993), the historian of science George Saliba
    notes how this decline (once argued to have been well under way
    in the early twelfth century) keeps having to be pushed later
    and later in time, as scholars start to read new manuscripts
    and process their findings.<ref target="#FN8">8</ref>  Closer to Matar’s own
    topic, Ahmad Dallal has written on Muslims’
    “curiosity” and knowledge of Jews (particularly in
    Yemen), from the early modern period to the early nineteenth
    century.<ref target="#FN9">9</ref> He notes that it is a commonplace even in
    relatively recent works for scholars to assert that Muslims had
    no positive interest in Jews and Jewish learning, thereby
    ignoring the large corpus of (predominantly Shi’ite
    Yemeni) jurisprudence and Muslim Torah scholarship.<ref target="#FN10">10</ref> With so much archival material only now
    being made available to scholars, and so much more still under
    wraps, arguments that depend upon absence or paucity of
    evidence seem like a risky venture academically speaking, quite
    apart from any other goal the author may wish to advance.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P5"/>[5] The
    manuscript sources for the travels of Priest Ilyas b. Hanna
    al-Mawsuli, written in Arabic, are very interesting in their
    own right.<ref target="#FN11">11</ref> One in the “Syriac Bishopric in
    Aleppo” contains the travel narrative in the first
    hundred pages, followed by over two hundred pages of
    translations from European authors on the discovery of America,
    and a fifty-five page account of the visit of an Ottoman
    ambassador to France. This manuscript forms the basis of
    Antoine Rabbat’s 1906 edition, which has been recently
    reprinted. The other manuscript, British Library Oriental MS
    3537, omits the ambassador’s visit.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P6"/>[6] From the
    narrative we learn maddeningly little about Ilyas b. Hanna
    al-Mawsuli himself, a Chaldean Catholic priest whose travels
    took him away from Baghdad to live in Paris, Spain, and South
    America and Mexico for a period of fifteen years. The
    first seven years of his travels were spent in Europe, and this
    period is only covered briefly (pp. 51-6). While in
    France, he visited King Louis XIV and his brother the Duke of
    Orleans, remaining in Paris for eight months and acting as a
    translator into Turkish for correspondence between the king and
    Sultan Mehmed IV.  He then visited Spain, and was granted
    permission to celebrate mass before the child King Carlos II
    and his mother the regent. When he was told to request
    anything he desired in return, he consulted with his friends
    and, rather against his better judgment, asked for “a
    permit and an irrevocable order to visit the West
    Indies.”<ref target="#FN12">12</ref> He sailed from Cadiz on February 12,
    1675. His goal was the city of Lima, Peru, whose minister was a
    man whom he had met in Spain. He remained there one year
    before receiving permission to go to “the mountains of
    silver.”</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P7"/>[7] Ilyas b.
    Hanna’s narrative of his travels in South America and
    Mexico (pp. 57-104) has a number of recurrent themes—the
    clerics, monasteries and churches he visited (where he often
    celebrated mass in Syriac for his fellow Catholics),
    observations about the Indians and how they were treated by the
    Spaniards, the number of times he fell seriously ill and was
    saved by the Virgin, and remarks about landscape, climate, and
    flora and fauna. But it is his travels through the mining
    regions of Peru and Bolivia that receives the most sustained
    treatment (pp. 67; 73-88). The bulk of this section is taken up
    by descriptions of visits to primarily silver, but also gold
    and mercury mines, processing centers and mints. He
    visited at least thirteen such operations, and made detailed
    observations of their location, size and especially their
    processing techniques. He even bought gold (p. 67) and
    some silver dust (p. 82).</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P8"/>[8] The
    narrative is rather quiet as to why Ilyas b. Hanna visited
    these places (at considerable trouble and cost to his health),
    and Matar does not hazard a guess. I can only note that
    the priest’s intense interest in mining overlapped with a
    period of crisis in the Ottoman coinage supply in the later
    seventeenth century.<ref target="#FN13">13</ref> This crisis had its roots in the
    sixteenth century, when silver pouring into Europe from the
    South American mines entered the Ottoman lands as coinage, by
    the later part of the century in the form of the European
    <hi rend="italic">groschen</hi> (Ottoman <hi rend="italic">kuruş</hi>), forming an
    increasingly popular currency alongside the Ottoman silver
    <hi rend="italic">akçe.</hi> Ultimately, the Ottoman state silver
    mines in the Balkans could not compete with this cheaper
    source, and the mines were virtually closed by the
    1640s. But the influx of silver was more than matched by
    outflows, and the seventeenth century (not unlike the later
    sixteenth century) was marked by a series of debasements in the
    <hi rend="italic">akçe</hi>, accompanied by counterfeiting. This
    led to currency substitution and hoarding; sources for Ottoman
    coinage dried up to the point where, from the mid-1650s to the
    mid-1680s, the minting of new gold and silver coinage in
    Istanbul was primarily to provide for ceremonial
    usage. During the reign of Mehmed IV (1648-87), only seven
    mints at most produced the <hi rend="italic">akçe</hi> and
    <hi rend="italic">para.</hi> But the European currency that was
    substituted for Ottoman had a curious feature—in the
    mid-seventeenth century, it was mainly copper, with a silver
    wash.  This currency was called <hi rend="italic">luigini,</hi> and it
    reached its peak usage between 1656 and 1669. Minted by
    French, Italian and Dutch merchants, it was not legal in its
    places of origin, but was made under contract, specifically for
    the Ottoman market. Both observers of the era and many
    modern scholars have been scandalized by this debased coinage,
    but, as Pamuk notes, the Ottoman empire was at war with Venice
    over Crete, and “debased coinage was better than no
    coinage.”<ref target="#FN14">14</ref> The story of Ottoman currency continues
    with the end of the war with Venice and the currency reforms
    beginning in 1669, the minting of copper coinage for a brief
    period starting in 1688, and finally the minting of the new
    <hi rend="italic">kuruş</hi> starting in 1690. American silver
    production had been in decline since 1670, to a degree that
    made the Anatolian and Balkan mines viable again, and these
    were the sources for the new <hi rend="italic">kuruş.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P9"/>[9] The
    priest Ilyas b. Hanna’s travels in South America from
    1676-1681 thus took place within a period of considerable
    economic turmoil revolving around silver. As to why he
    stayed in South America for six years, this seems to have been
    connected to some commercial expectations, partly unfulfilled
    because his friend the minister of Lima was dismissed during
    his stay. After several years the minister successfully refuted
    the charges against him, but was not reinstated. At this
    juncture, the priest left for Mexico, where he remained for a
    number of months before sailing for Spain. It seems that he
    continued in service to the Church of Rome, where he died and
    was buried in 1693.<ref target="#FN15">15</ref>
         </p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P10"/>[10] In
    focusing on only one of Matar’s four travel narratives, I
    have omitted much of interest. Readers of the book will
    learn of religious debates held over the dinner table, a man
    struggling with his feelings for a beautiful young woman, a man
    on a diplomatic mission who is welcomed into the bosom of a
    French family, and much else. These are some of the
    intimate and often light-hearted moments in narratives that
    were assembled in response to a rather serious academic
    issue: that of Arabic speakers’ interest in, and
    knowledge of Europe and Europeans. Part of the importance of
    this issue lies in the ease in which it can be
    politicized. Both the larger issue and the individual
    seventeenth century authors have been well served by Professor
    Matar.</p>_______<lb/>

            <anchor corresp="P1"/>[1] Among
    the important developments in the transmission of the Peshitta
    text through the centuries is the recent emergence of the
    Leiden critical edition. The success of this edition can be
    measured by the amount of research it has stimulated, research
    that has focused on the transmission of the Peshitta and its
    character. This theme was the subject of the Second Peshitta
    Symposium, held at Leiden in 1993 (<hi rend="italic">The Peshitta as a
    Translation: Papers Read at the II Peshitta Symposium Held at
    Leiden 19-21 August 1993</hi> [eds. P.B. Dirksen and A. van der
    Kooij] [MPIL 8; Leiden 1995]). Scholars are now busy
    investigating the translation techniques of the
    Peshitta’s individual books since, when the
    characteristics of the translation are identified, isolated
    readings, unique to the Peshitta, can be properly interpreted.
    Peshitta Jeremiah is among the most challenging of biblical
    books, since, apart from its length, Jeremiah contains an
    anthology of literary genres (narrative prose, poetic oracles,
    proverbs, and so forth). Then there are its daunting text
    critical questions: the Greek text is about one-eighth shorter
    than the Hebrew text. To further complicate matters, a critical
    edition of Peshitta Jeremiah has not yet appeared. In view of
    these obstacles, the news that Greenberg has undertaken an
    investigation of translation techniques in Peshitta Jeremiah
    will be well received among Syriac scholars, Peshitta scholars,
    text critics and biblical exegetes.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P2"/>[2]
    Greenberg begins her investigation examining the character of
    the <hi rend="italic">Urtext</hi> of the Peshitta. She notes that
    “whenever the translation did in fact depart from the
    literal, whether both in the <hi rend="italic">Urtext</hi> and in the later
    stages of copying and revising, or only during this later
    period, three elements are clear: first, that it did depart,
    and to a considerable extent; second, that the great majority
    of the differences between the MT and the Peshitta to Jeremiah
    are small, matters of style rather than of sense; and third,
    that many of these small differences were the work of the
    scribes, not of the translator” (p. 15). Greenberg takes
    the Codex Ambrosianus (Peshitta MS. 7a1 according to the sigla
    of the Leiden edition) as the text for study.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P3"/>[3] In
    chapter two Greenberg explains her method: “The results
    presented here were obtained by word-for-word comparison of the
    source document and the translation throughout the 1364 verses
    of the book” (p. 26).  This method must have
    produced a mountain of data. So a balance had to be reached
    “between two approaches: excessive amounts of detail and
    numerous examples to illustrate each point have the drawback
    that they take up so much space that there is not enough room
    for adequate discussion; on the other hand, limiting the
    quantity of detail too stringently does not allow the reader to
    judge whether or not the conclusions drawn are
    well-founded” (p. 27). The author decided to give
    “in detail, all or nearly all the most interesting
    examples of the various features of the translation technique,
    together with a sufficient number of supporting examples”
    along with “a structured sample in which the prevalence
    of these features could be measured” (p. 27). This
    structured example is comprised of the tenth verse of each
    chapter of Jeremiah (except in Chapters 45 and 47 where the
    fifth and the seventh verses, respectively, are selected).</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P4"/>[4] I must
    admit that, as I read this book, I remained unsure about the
    need for the “structured sample.” Since all 1364
    verses of Jeremiah were studied, it would have been possible to
    list all the examples of a given translation technique (just
    the verse numbers) and then to select the
    “interesting” ones for further discussion. Then the
    “structured sample” would have become superfluous
    as the reader could assess how often (and where) a given
    translation technique explains a particular Peshitta reading. A
    complete list of all the unique readings in Peshitta Jeremiah
    would have rendered the book invaluable to text critics, who
    will consult Greenberg’s work for assistance in
    interpreting isolated Peshitta readings in Jeremiah.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P5"/>[5] Each
    chapter studies a particular translation technique from
    Peshitta Jeremiah. Chapter two presents eleven examples from
    Jeremiah where the Peshitta has an identifiable change in the
    sense of the Hebrew. The “small size of this group”
    sustains Greenberg’s premise that “on the whole,
    the sense of the <hi rend="italic">Vorlage</hi> is meticulously
    preserved” (p. 26). Chapter three looks at various types
    of “additions.” Greenberg’s first example,
    from Jer 6:3, is quite interesting.  The Hebrew reads:
    “shepherds and their flocks will come to her”. To
    this phrase, 7a1 adds “together” (<hi rend="italic">'a(y)k
    <hi rend="u">h</hi>da</hi>). This addition can also be
    categorized as a harmonization with Jer 6:11, 12, 21 where
    Hebrew ya<hi rend="u">h</hi>daw is rendered
    <hi rend="italic">'ak<hi rend="u">h</hi>da</hi>. But what is intriguing
    is that the addition in 6:3 in 7a1 is unique in terms of its
    orthography (<hi rend="italic">'a(y)k <hi rend="u">h</hi>da</hi> instead
    of <hi rend="italic">'ak<hi rend="u">h</hi>da</hi>). This could suggest
    that a hand other than the translator’s added these
    words.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P6"/>[6] Lexical
    equivalents, studied in chapter four, reveal that there is no
    one-to-one correspondence between Hebrew and Syriac lexemes. In
    fact, the translator varied his selection of Syriac equivalents
    for the same Hebrew word “according to his own
    taste” (p. 46). When two different Syriac words could
    render the same Hebrew word, then subtle distinctions between
    Syriac lexemes may have determined the translator’s
    choice.  Chapter five treats harmonizations, perhaps one
    of the most common characteristics of the Peshitta
    version.  I have found that many readings in the Peshitta
    that diverge from the MT, such as the addition in 6:3 noted
    above, are harmonizations, and text critics do well to consider
    harmonization as a first option for explaining individual
    Peshitta readings. Greenberg illustrates how the translator was
    ready to clarify “figurative language” but
    anthropomorphic descriptors for God are preserved in the
    Peshitta (chapter six).  Grammatical inconsistencies in
    the Hebrew are corrected in the Peshitta (chapter seven).</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P7"/>[7] Special
    attention is given to passages that appear twice in the Bible
    (chapter eight). In some cases a passage is repeated within the
    book of Jeremiah itself (i.e., Jer 6:12-15 and Jer 8:10). 
    In others, the duplicate passage appears elsewhere in the
    Bible. Greenberg demonstrates that such passages were
    “largely translated independently of one another”
    (p. 75). The translator normally did not harmonize his
    translation, though there are a few examples that suggest some
    degree of harmonization.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P8"/>[8] Chapter
    nine treats minuses in the Peshitta with respect to the MT. The
    minuses are divided into three groups: (1) apparently
    accidental; (2) apparently deliberate; and (3) those which
    throw light on the wording of the <hi rend="italic">Vorlage</hi>. Three
    examples of accidental minuses and nineteen examples of
    deliberate minuses are discussed. The third category receives
    the most attention and the argumentation becomes quite complex.
    After reviewing the literature on the textual transmission of
    Jeremiah (LXX, MT, and Qumran), Greenberg argues that in cases
    of “purposeless repetitions” the translator
    consulted the LXX:</p>
         <p>A translator anxious to defend the
    originality of his <hi rend="italic">Vorlage,</hi> and having in mind the
    critical reader who might find grounds for suspicion in
    apparently purposeless repetitions suggesting the possibility
    of underlying deliberate conflations or scribal error, might
    make omissions to avoid such controversy, particularly if he
    did not regard himself as bound by the constraints of working
    with a letter-perfect text. Nevertheless, when translating
    double readings the translator into Syriac gave both
    components, although his careful reading of the Hebrew must
    often have led him to suspect the presence of secondary
    expansion of the text, and a glance at the LXX would in many
    cases have strengthened his suspicion that the <hi rend="italic">Vorlage</hi>
    showed signs of corruption”(p. 109-110).</p>
         <p>Several examples of minuses (Peshitta and LXX agree against
    the MT; the LXX and MT agree against the Peshitta) are adduced
    to support her theory.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P9"/>[9] In
    chapter ten Greenberg develops the notion of a “Peshitta
    School.” It seems that the “translators worked to
    some extent as colleagues rather than as separate individuals,
    feeling that they were members of a ‘Peshitta
    School’” (p. 126). After the original generation of
    translators died out, later scribes (Greenberg prefers this
    term to “copyists”) would have “felt
    responsible for the character of the text” (p. 126) and
    would have “felt themselves to be part of the Peshitta
    School tradition: there would surely have been a continuous
    consciousness in eastern religious circles that this text,
    rooted in Judaism and spanning the early centuries of
    Christianity, was of the greatest importance” (p. 126).
    In future research the author may want to support this
    suggestive proposal with appropriate citations from Syriac
    authors who could testify to this “continuous
    consciousness” within the “Peshitta
    School.”</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P10"/>[10]
    Chapter eleven treats an important question in Peshitta
    studies—the relationship between the Peshitta and the
    LXX. In her introduction, Greenberg noted that “such
    influence is not in doubt” (p. 22). In this chapter she
    adduces four cases to illustrate this “sporadic”
    influence (p. 147). I will take up the first one, which comes
    from Jer 5:26. According to Greenberg, there are two readings
    that witness to the strong influence of the LXX on the
    Peshitta. The first is that the Peshitta and the LXX agree to
    translate Hebrew <hi rend="italic">hi<hi rend="u">ss</hi>ibu</hi> with
    <hi rend="italic">waqim</hi> and <hi rend="italic">estēsan</hi>, respectively. The
    second one is that both omit the obscure Hebrew word
    <hi rend="italic">yashur</hi>. But did the Peshitta translator need to
    consult the LXX to arrive at <hi rend="italic">waqim</hi> for MT
    <hi rend="italic">hi<hi rend="u">ss</hi>ibu</hi>? A quick glance at a
    concordance reveals that the only other example of
    <hi rend="italic">hiphil</hi> √<hi rend="italic">n<hi rend="u">s</hi>b</hi> in
    Jeremiah appears in 31:21 (<hi rend="italic">ha<hi rend="u">ss</hi>ibi</hi>) where it is translated in 7a1 with
    <hi rend="italic">'aqim</hi>. A look through Genesis reveals that each
    <hi rend="italic">hiphil</hi> of √<hi rend="italic">n<hi rend="u">s</hi>b</hi>
    is translated with the <hi rend="italic">aphel</hi> of
    √<hi rend="italic">qwm</hi>.  Thus, the translator hardly needed
    the LXX for its rendering of <hi rend="italic">hi<hi rend="u">ss</hi>ibu</hi>. The overall character of the Peshitta
    translation of Jer 5:26 raises further questions about the
    supposed influence from the LXX, since the Peshitta strays from
    both the MT and the LXX in a few places, including the
    interpretation of <hi rend="italic">kshak</hi> with <hi rend="italic">'a(y)k syage</hi>.
    Given this freedom one wonders if the translator had to consult
    the LXX for permission to omit the difficult Hebrew word
    <hi rend="italic">yashur</hi>.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P11"/>[11] One
    could quibble with the other examples as well but the more
    important question regards Greenberg’s methodology. When
    Peshitta scholars seek to determine the relationship between
    the Peshitta and the LXX (or any biblical version for that
    matter), the first step must be to present a complete list of
    the agreements between the Peshitta and the LXX for a given
    biblical book or section of a book. Even though the task may be
    Herculean (especially for Jeremiah), it remains, nonetheless,
    necessary. Once <hi rend="italic">all</hi> the agreements with the LXX have
    been identified and given individual consideration, then the
    Peshitta can be assessed for traces of possible influence from
    the LXX. This method also permits the total number of
    agreements with the LXX to be compared with the number of
    instances where the Peshitta goes its own way (as in the
    interpretation <hi rend="italic">'a(y)k syage</hi> Kya in Jer 5:26). Then the
    <hi rend="italic">degree</hi> of influence, if any, can also be measured. For
    now, the question of LXX influence on Peshitta Jeremiah awaits
    further study.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P12"/>[12]
    Chapters twelve through fourteen present various strategies
    that the translator employed for handling difficult Hebrew
    texts. These include guesswork, influence from elsewhere in the
    Bible, mimicking the sound of the Hebrew word in Syriac, and
    even resorting to an “atomistic translation.”
    Examples are adduced to illustrate each translation strategy.
    The book concludes with a bibliography, an index of authors, an
    index of biblical citations and a general index.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P13"/>[13] This
    volume lays the groundwork for future research into Peshitta
    Jeremiah and is a welcome addition to the field.
    Greenberg’s “Peshitta School” and her
    understanding of the consciousness of later scribes offer a
    fascinating approach to resolving the obscure origins of the
    Peshitta version.  Above all, she is to be commended for
    her willingness to investigate Peshitta Jeremiah, despite the
    obstacles that impede a thorough study of this biblical
    book. </p>

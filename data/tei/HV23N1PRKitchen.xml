                    Ph.D. dissertation at the Pontifical Oriental Institute, Rome, by Sr. Roselin
                    Aravackal, a member of the monastic community Mar Toma Sahordarikal (Sisters of
                    St. Thomas) in Vidyanagar, Kottayam, Kerala. Her dissertation, defended
                    under her secular name, Sheeba Sebastian, and written under the guidance of
                    Emidio Vergani, is the most in-depth and thorough study to date of the <hi
                        rend="italic">Liber Graduum/Book of Steps/Ktābā d-Massqātā</hi> or <hi
                        rend="italic">KM</hi> (as abbreviated throughout the volume), promising to
                    invigorate and enrich research on this important, yet still enigmatic work.
                        Aravackal posits that the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Book of Steps</hi>’ author developed a three-tiered system of the Christian
                    life and the Church that permeates the entire work: (1) Uprightness (<hi
                        rend="italic">kēnūtā</hi>); (2) Perfection (<hi rend="italic">gmīrūtā</hi>);
                    and (3) a level beyond or above Perfection.</p>
                <p> Aravackal begins with a detailed review of previous scholarship on the <hi
                        rend="italic">KM</hi>, accepting the intentional anonymity of the author who
                    was situated somewhere within the area of modern-day Iraq, but offering the
                    plausible hypothesis that the community may have lived on both sides of the
                    vacillating Roman-Persian border. The spectre of Messalianism attributed to the
                        <hi rend="italic">KM</hi> by some scholars is rejected, especially by the
                    insistence upon ecclesial and sacramental life (<hi rend="italic">Mēmrā</hi>
                    12), and the denunciation of spiritualization of physical asceticism (<hi
                        rend="italic">Mēmrā</hi> 10). Aravackal opts for a late fourth- or early
                    fifth-century date, based upon the author’s use of several key terms found
                    during this period – the occurrence of the term <hi rend="italic">krīsṭyana</hi>, the absence of the masculine <hi rend="italic">rūḥa
                        qaddišā</hi>, and the absence of terms such as <hi rend="italic"
                        >dayrāyā</hi>, <hi rend="italic">dayrā</hi> that reflect institutionalized
                    monasticism. </p>
                <p> After dealing with these foundational questions, Aravackal dives into an
                    intensive exegesis of the character of the text, centering not upon the
                    individual <hi rend="italic">mēmrē</hi> and their expositions of various
                    problems, but assembling the pieces of the <hi rend="italic">KM</hi> author’s
                    theological universe. Aravackal’s footnotes are over-flowing, not only providing
                    a witness of the Syriac texts, but remarkable also for her comments on an
                    expanding secondary literature on the <hi rend="italic">KM</hi> and related
                    works. One methodological problem is the periodic citation from studies in
                    Italian without translation or summary, and several French and German citations
                    in the same manner. A short summary of their ideas would have clarified how
                    these citations were being utilised in the exposition.</p>
                <p> Aravackal’s analysis of the “Triple Gradation” of the Church and of the
                    individual Christian, emanating out of <hi rend="italic">Mēmrā</hi> 12, “On the
                    Hidden and Public Ministry of the Church,” is a creative and original
                    interpretation. While she observes that beyond the categories of visible,
                    hidden/heart, and heavenly in this <hi rend="italic">mēmrā</hi>, little else is
                    explicitly mentioned along these lines in the <hi rend="italic">KM</hi>, the
                    author does write about "going beyond or above Perfection" (<hi rend="italic"
                        >Mēmrā</hi> 6: “On Those Who are Made Perfect and Continue to Grow”), which
                    certainly can function as a “third gradation.” The question is whether this is
                    indeed a third level, or a more developed description of Perfection.</p>
                <p> The <hi rend="italic">KM</hi> author, indeed, leaves a great deal unsaid,
                    perhaps his most significant quality as a spiritual writer. The academic issue
                    with the <hi rend="italic">KM</hi> is that the author mentions neither time nor
                    place, nor people, except for biblical personalities. Few scholars have
                    speculated whether the order of the 30 <hi rend="italic">mēmrē</hi> is
                    chronological, but in the last six <hi rend="italic">mēmrē</hi> one can sense
                    dramatic movement and change in the community. The author recognizes that the
                    Perfect (<hi rend="italic">gmīrē)</hi> have become lax in their discipline and
                    prideful in their status, and that the Upright (<hi rend="italic">kēnē</hi>) are
                    now more faithful and humble – a surprising spiritual development outside his
                    expectations. </p>
                <p> Aravackal’s reconstruction and depiction of the tripartite anthropology is done
                    with careful precision, presenting the fundamental character of “the religious
                    person.” The “outer/inner person” needs to be reconciled by the balancing of
                    symbiotic dichotomies – inner/outer, bodily/spiritual, hidden/visible. The
                    Perfect exemplify this balance, living on the earth while looking into heaven,
                    and thus becoming “the meeting of heaven and earth.” The Perfect are still
                    earthly creatures, but are living in a realized eschatological state, and
                    several of their failings which the author points out are a result of not
                    keeping a proper balance.</p>
                <p> Aravackal combs the <hi rend="italic">KM</hi> for theological images that occur
                    regularly, but not systematically. The identity and function of “the robe of
                    glory,” one of the clothing metaphors in early Syriac theology, is described.
                    The author declares that “the robe” did not originally exist as a physical
                    entity, but in the mind of Adam and Eve. Only after their disobedience, when
                    they first put on physical clothes, did they realize that they had been naked. </p>
                <p> The concept of “mirror” is thoroughly looked at, not only in the <hi
                        rend="italic">KM</hi>, but with analogous citations from Simon Taibuteh and
                    John of Dalyatha. The mirror is anything that reflects God’s being, particularly
                    nature. The inner mirror reflects God’s light onto oneself and into others, so
                    that one sees all others in this divine light. Aravackal illustrates how the
                    “luminous eye” as the inner “organ” which perceives spiritual reality is
                    depicted as various kinds of “eyes” in the <hi rend="italic">KM</hi>. </p>
                <p> Aravackal moves to ascetical categories, parsing <hi rend="italic">msarqūtā –
                    </hi>emptying – as the term for ascetic renunciation, and thus an essential
                    characteristic of <hi rend="italic">qaddišūtā </hi>(holiness, celibacy) and <hi
                        rend="italic">īhīdāyūtā</hi> (solitariness). The infamous ascetical goal of
                    the author to “break one’s mind” receives due attention, as Aravackal
                    understands the verb and function as one of “stripping oneself” of worldly
                    attractions and distractions. While Aravackal retains the verb, she does not
                    perceive the author’s spiritual intention as harshly as the English translation
                    implies. In similar fashion is her understanding of “baptism by fire and Spirit”
                    as a system of ascetical practices to reach Perfection. Which ascetical
                    practices this system entails is not reported, for the <hi rend="italic">KM</hi>
                    has distinguished itself for not requiring or mentioning the extreme ascetical
                    regimens infamously described in later Syriac hagiography. </p>
                <p> Aravackal’s “pedagogical” construction of “the tripartite man” shows insight
                    into the vision of the <hi rend="italic">KM</hi> author, but has a conceptual
                    problem in the text itself. That is, the Upright and Perfect are amply defined,
                    frequently in reference to one another, but “the third grade” which is beyond
                    Perfection <hi rend="italic">per se</hi> is not identified or classified
                    specifically by the author. Aravackal’s construction fits where the <hi
                        rend="italic">KM</hi> seems to be heading – the third level of the Church
                    and the Perfect individual is there – but not in the way the author originally
                    saw it happening. Aravackal observes several times that the <hi rend="italic"
                        >KM</hi> is not a work of systematic theology, yet attempting to reconstruct
                    a triple gradation is an act of systematization. In the earlier <hi
                        rend="italic">mēmrē</hi>, the author defines the levels of the <hi
                        rend="italic">kēnē</hi> and <hi rend="italic">gmīrē</hi>, but the latter <hi
                        rend="italic">mēmrē</hi> reveal him <hi rend="italic">discovering</hi> the
                    nature of spiritual life as it evolves in his awareness and in the experience of
                    his church and disciples. Mention on several occasions, moreover, of those who
                    have fallen from Uprightness should be seen as an unspoken fourth grade. As the
                        <hi rend="italic">KM</hi> community aged, the author’s theological
                    experience and comprehension ran ahead of his original construct. </p>
                <p> Aravackal compares John the Solitary of Apamea’s fully articulated tripartite
                    structure of <hi rend="italic">pagrānūtā</hi>, <hi rend="italic">napšānūtā</hi>,
                    and <hi rend="italic">rūḥānūtā</hi> (the
                    corporeal, psychical, and spiritual state) to those of the <hi rend="italic"
                        >KM</hi>, but she appears to want to fit the later three-level system
                    retroactively onto the <hi rend="italic">KM</hi>. John the Solitary approximates
                    the <hi rend="italic">KM</hi> Perfect and Upright in several instances, but then
                    goes beyond the structure of the <hi rend="italic">KM</hi> elsewhere.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italic">The Book of Steps</hi> remains a large, complex and intriguing
                    witness to the emergence of the early Syriac church and theo-logy, to which the
                    labour of Sr. Roselin Aravackal presents an insightful new configuration of what
                    this anonymous author was telling his congregation and us about the spiritual
                    pilgrimage. </p>

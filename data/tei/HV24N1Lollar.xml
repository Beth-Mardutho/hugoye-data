                <p xml:lang="en">This paper introduces some overlooked witnesses to the Syriac
                    translation of the Euthalian Apparatus found in apocryphal narratives about Paul.
                    The narratives entitled the “History of Paul”, the “Martyrdom of Paul the Apostle
                    and the Discovery of His Severed Head”, and “The History That Should be Placed at
                    the Beginning of the Book of Paul the Apostle” preserve portions of the prologue to
                    Paul’s Epistles attributed to Euthalius. These narratives circulated independently
                    from New Testament manuscripts where the Euthalian Apparatus typically circulates as
                    paratextual material. They are clearly dependent on the Euthalian prologue and are
                    valuable witnesses for understanding the development and use of the Apparatus in
                    Syriac. These three narratives appear to preserve an early version of the Euthalian
                    Apparatus prior to the insertion of the martyrium Pauli in the fifth century. These
                    narratives thus perhaps constitute some of the earliest witnesses to the Euthalian
                    Apparatus in Syriac.</p>

            <p xml:lang="en">Sometime in the late nineteenth century, the great Italian
                philologist Ignazio Guidi obtained a copy of a manuscript from the archbishop of
                Diyarbakir (Amid/Omid), Khayyât.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn1" n="1"><p
                        rend="footnote text"> Guidi had good relationships with several different
                        important members of the Syriac churches. See R. Contini, “Guidi, Ignazio
                        (1844-1935),” in S.P. Brock, A.M. Butts, G.A. Kiraz, and L. van Rompay,
                        eds., <hi rend="italic">Gorgias Encyclopedic Dictionary of the Syriac

                Guidi later shared this manuscript with Paul Bedjan to include in his amassed
                collection of <hi rend="italic">Acta martyrum et sanctorum</hi>, published between
                1890 and 1897. The two texts Bedjan took from the manuscript were titled “The
                History of Simon Cephas, Chief of the Apostles” (<hi rend="italic">Hist. Sim.
                    Ceph.</hi>) and “The History of the Holy Apostle Mār Paul” (<hi rend="italic"
                    >Hist. Paul</hi>).<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn2" n="2"><p rend="footnote text"

                        (Leipzig and Paris: Harrassowitz, 1890), pp. 1-44. Guidi published a
                        follow-up to Bedjan in which he corrected some of the Syriac text. See I.
                        Guidi, “Bemerkingen zum ersten Bande der syrischen Acta Martyrum et

                            Gesellschaft</hi> 46 (1892): pp. 744-758.</p></note> Ostensibly, these
                texts were some variety of apocryphal narratives about Peter and Paul, and they have
                been studied as such.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn3" n="3"><p rend="footnote text">

                        of the text by F. Stanley Jones, “The History of Simon Cephas, the Chief of
                        the Apostles,” in T. Burke and B. Landau, eds., <hi rend="italic">New

                        Volume 3 (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, forthcoming). The second half of the
                        narrative was translated (based on one manuscript) by D.L. Eastman,
                        <hi rend="italic">The Ancient Martyrdom Accounts of Peter and Paul </hi>(WGRW
                        39; Atlanta: SBL Press, 2015), pp. 194-201. The text was studied and
                        translated into Italian by E. Luigi De Stefani, “Storia del beato apostolo
                        S. Paolo. Traduzione dal siriaco preceduta da un breve studio delle fonti”,

            <p xml:lang="en">Since the two texts appear in the manuscripts together, they have typically been
                studied together; though
                <hi rend="italic">Hist. Sim. Ceph. </hi>has undoubtedly
                received more attention.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn4" n="4"><p

                    121-140.</p></note> In his follow up to Bedjan’s publication of the two
                narratives, Guidi merely observes about <hi rend="italic">Hist. Paul</hi>: “Viel
                kürzer gehalten ist die Erzählung über den h. Paulus und das meiste ist der
                canonische Apostelgeschichte Nacherzählt. Seite 41-44 enhalten einige merkwürdige
                Züge aus der Legende.”<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn5" n="5"><p rend="footnote text"
                        > Guidi, “Bemerkingen,” p. 746.</p></note> While he was partially correct
                about the sources behind <hi rend="italic">Hist. Paul</hi>, Guidi offers no
                substantive comments about the narrative itself. It was not until over a decade
                later when another Italian scholar, Luigi De Stefani, produced an Italian
                translation of the text with an introduction that the source of the
                <hi rend="italic">Hist. Paul </hi>became clear.<note

                demonstrated that major portions of <hi rend="italic">Hist. Paul</hi> were not
                unique apocryphal stories, or even paraphrases of Acts, but a Syriac translation of
                portions of the <hi rend="italic">Euthalian Apparatus</hi>.</p>
            <p xml:lang="en">Around the same time that de Stafani was writing about <hi rend="italic">Hist.
                    Paul</hi>, Ignatius Ephrem Rahmani, the Syrian Catholic Patriarch from 1898 to
                1929, studied some Syriac manuscripts at the patriarchate library at Sharfeh near

                The latter two texts are actually Syriac translations of a portion of the

            <p xml:lang="en">This paper will examine the interface between these apocryphal narratives about Paul

                association permits a more direct perspective about the origins of these apocrypha.

                <p xml:lang="en">In the late fourth century, or perhaps as late as the seventh century, an author
                    by the name of ‘Euthaliaus’ (perhaps a pseudonym), living in Caesarea, or
                    perhaps somewhere in Egypt, composed an epitome of Acts, the Catholic Epistles,

                            much debated in scholarship. </p></note> This material served as an

                    contained Acts and the Catholic Epistles. Both volumes contain four primary
                    elements: 1) a series of πρόλογοι where the author provides a number of
                    historical and biographical details about the lives of the scriptural writers;
                    2) κεφάλαια (‘chapter headings’) which provided titles and chapter divisions of
                    each text; 3) ὑποθέσεις (‘arguments’) which provide summaries of the contents of
                    each text; and 4) a series of tables listing scripture quotations (i.e., Hebrew
                    Bible quotations) called ‘testimonia’ (see Table 1).<note place="foot"

                    included “sense-division and punctuation of the text, for better presentation of
                    the sense in public reading. Thus the manuscripts with the Euthalian Apparatus
                    contained the biblical text in a very distinctive form with regard both to
                    layout and to explanatory material.”<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn11" n="11"><p

                    CE. Manuscript O, by contrast, shows some affiliations with Polycarp’s revision
                    filtered through the new revision/ translation of Tumo of Harkel in 615/16 CE.
                    In other words, MSS L and O represent two distinct iterations of the <hi

                    provides multiple examples of comparison between L, O, the Peshitta, and the
                    Greek (à la Zacagni). In particular, Brock provides more substance to Zuntz’s
                    claim that MS L is connected with the Philoxenian version of the NT.</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">A few conclusions can be drawn from these three major studies. First, it is clear
                    that Greek manuscripts containing the
                    <hi rend="italic">Euthalian Apparatus </hi>were used in the
                    revisions/translations of the Philoxenian and the Harklean versions of the
                    Syriac New Testament. The Peshitta NT certainly has more diversity, as there are
                    Peshitta manuscripts that do not contain the <hi rend="italic">Euthalian</hi>
                    material. The studies of Zuntz and Brock demonstrate the likelihood that the
                    Philoxenian revision made by Polycarp was based directly on a <hi rend="italic"
                        >Euthalian</hi> Greek manuscript. The Harklean, for which we have several
                    manuscript exemplars, all exhibit influence from the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Apparatus</hi>. We may conclude, secondly, therefore, that the Harklean
                    translation of the Syriac NT is inextricably related to the <hi rend="italic"

                                that the surviving fragments are in disarray and it has only been
                                possible to reestablish the original order for fols. 1-43 and

                        contents of either text that suggests they derived from an East Syrian

                    <p xml:lang="en">The same dates from the <hi rend="italic">martyrium Pauli</hi> appear
                        elsewhere in the prologue, but in an inverted order and spread throughout

                        undeniable. De Stefani therefore claimed that the editor of
                        <hi rend="italic">Hist. Paul </hi>had at his disposal a
                        version of Euthalius that included the <hi rend="italic">martyrium</hi>,
                        since the order of the dates in the
                        <hi rend="italic">martyrium </hi>matches exactly the
                        order of those found in
                        <hi rend="italic">Hist. Paul </hi>13. This is a
                        possible conclusion, but the evidence is circumstantial. Moreover, it is
                        strange that the parallels between
                        <hi rend="italic">Hist. Paul </hi>and the
                        <hi rend="italic">martyrium </hi>end here. The editor
                        of <hi rend="italic">Hist. Paul </hi>includes a
                        completely different story of the aftermath of Paul’s (and Peter’s)
                        martyrdom after mentioning these dates. Without more details from the
                        <hi rend="italic">martyrium </hi>to certify a
                        connection, and since the dates also appear in the prologue without the <hi
                            rend="italic">martyrium</hi>, we must allow for the possibility that the
                        shared order of the dates between the texts is coincidental. Moreover, given
                        that <hi rend="italic">Hist. Paul </hi>makes no other
                        use of the <hi rend="italic">martyrium Pauli</hi>, but instead includes a
                        unique story about the trees, it is more likely that,

                    <p xml:lang="en">Given the intersections between these two portrayals of the <hi rend="italic"
                            >Euthalian</hi> prologue to the Pauline Epistles, it is reasonable to
                        suggest that some intertextuality is at play. I do not mean to suggest that
                        either text is necessarily copying the other—though that remains a
                        possibility—but rather that the two are cut from a similar cloth and their
                        respective editors have stitched together separate profiles of St. Paul’s
                        life using nearly identical fragments from the <hi rend="italic">Euthalian
                            Apparatus</hi>. Furthermore, provided that these texts share so much in
                        common, we must regard the
                        <hi rend="italic">History of Paul </hi>as a valuable
                        source for the Syriac <hi rend="italic">Euthalian Apparatus</hi>. Beyond
                        this, it is important to consider the process by which an editor has excised
                        fragments of an existing text and invented a wholly new and distinct sketch
                        of Paul’s life and deeds. I will say more about this in my conclusion. Next,
                        we will consider yet another piece of the <hi rend="italic">Euthalian
                            Apparatus</hi> masquerading as an apocryphal rendering of St. Paul’s

                    of the later discovery of Paul’s lost, severed head by a farmer. After some
                    miraculous activity, the farmer notifies Xystus (Sixtus), the bishop of Rome,
                    who recognizes that this must be Paul’s severed head. They conduct an experiment
                    by bringing the head into contact with the body of Paul and their theory is
                    confirmed when the head reattaches itself to the body.</p>

                    thirty-five years: thirty-one when he was traveling around everywhere, two in
                    prison in Caesarea, and two in Rome. He became a martyr in the thirty-sixth year
                    after the passion of our Savior. Behold, he was placed with great honor in the
                    splendid churches of the empire in Rome, and every year on the twenty-ninth of

                        Eastman evidently misunderstood Rahmani’s original statements about these

                        Rahmani did not provide any details. On the contrary, Rahmani explains that
                        <hi rend="italic">Mart. Paul Sev. Head </hi>came from
                        one manuscript copied in 1468,<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn49" n="49"><p

                                manuscript contains ܬܘܪ̈ܓܡܐ of Moshe bar Kepha. Rahmani says, “Ibi

                        are Syriac translations of the <hi rend="italic">Euthalian</hi> prologue to
                        the Pauline Epistles. If Rahmani did indeed pull the “History” and the
                        “Martyrdom” from a Harklean manuscript at Sharfeh, then it would leave us
                        with two distinct recensions between the texts we have examined. As I argued
                        above, the organization of the Euthalian material in <hi rend="italic">Hist.
                            Paul</hi> matches quite closely to the organization in MS L/P20, a
                        Peshitta manuscript. The texts edited by Rahmani, by contrast, reveal
                        knowledge of a complete version of the Syriac <hi rend="italic"
                            >Apparatus</hi> in a Harklean NT manuscript. This is not terribly
                        surprising, since, as we saw earlier, von Dobschütz’s MS O (=H1) contains a
                        full version of the prologue. It is possible, therefore, that the Sharfeh
                        manuscript described by Rahmani belongs to the same manuscript family as
                        O/H1. </p>

                        from this statement which “book” is being discussed. Within the context, the
                        most obvious conclusion is that it refers to the prologue itself. It
                        certainly could not refer to the Harklean translation, which took place over
                        a century later; nor could it refer to Polycarp’s translation for Philoxenus
                        in 508 CE, though it is closer to that date. The most plausible explanation
                        is that this statement claims that the Syriac <hi rend="italic"
                            >Euthalian</hi> prologue to the Pauline Epistles was first translated
                        into Syriac in 499. </p>
                    <p xml:lang="en">In fact, this dating for the first translation compliments the theory of von

                        prologue prior to 508, one that may have contained the <hi rend="italic"

                        manuscript of the Peshitta containing the prologue material, which was then
                        used, in conjunction with Polycarp’s edition, to revise the Peshitta
                        further. The outcome of this may be seen in MS L/P20 (see Table 11). Thus,
                        if we trust the date provided in the “Martyrdom” edited by Rahmani, we can
                        more precisely date the translation of the prologue to the Pauline Epistles
                        into Syriac. To be sure, there are still some mysteries about how various
                        pieces fit together. As Brock points out, MS L/P20 is surprisingly an East
                        Syrian manuscript of the Peshitta.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn56" n="56"

                        library held so many Harklean translations, given that Tumo’s whole project
                        was done on behalf of the Syrian Orthodox (Miaphysite) Church. These
                        questions cannot be answered here. Suffice it to say, the apocryphal texts
                        studied above are important pieces for the history of the Syriac <hi

                <p xml:lang="en">I have drawn attention to several texts that masquerade as apocryphal stories
                    about Paul. In reality, these stories come directly from the prologue to the
                    Pauline Epistles contained in the <hi rend="italic">Euthalian Apparatus</hi>. In
                    other words, although these texts appear to be apocryphal traditions about Paul
                    (specifically about his martyrdom), they actually come from NT manuscripts
                    themselves. These examples provide insight into the importance of paratextual
                    material for the study of late-antique and Medieval Christianity. The <hi
                        rend="italic">Euthalian</hi> prologues were included in some of the New
                    Testaments that were read by Christians in these periods. As D.C. Parker

                    Scripture—authoritative accounts of Paul’s life and death. The continued
                    transmission of the Euthalian prologue in NT manuscripts testifies, at a
                    material level, to their importance in the scriptural practices a variety of

                <p xml:lang="en">At the same time, the texts studied here are examples of how even ancient scribes
                    and copyists engaged in the “wresting” and “ripping” of texts out of one textual

                    piece of a text from its nascent context and reappropriating it to a new one.
                    Such a scriptural practice as this allows us to glimpse the malleability of
                    texts (even parts of texts) at the hands of their ancient authors. Moreover, we
                    can glimpse the types of discursive fights over the “correct” dates and
                    “accurate” accounts surrounding Saints’ lives. In the end, at the very least, we
                    must admit that the content <hi rend="italic">Euthalian</hi> prologues served as
                    a source of inspiration for authors and writers to (re)imagine the life of St.

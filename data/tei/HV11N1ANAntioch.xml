         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P1"/>[1] In 2006
    a new charity, named ‘Antioch’, was set up and
    registered with the aim of promoting research on the cultural
    heritage of the Rum Orthodox (Chalcedonian) Patriarchate of
    Antioch. Although the early period, up to the time of the Arab
    conquests, is comparatively well known, the subsequent
    centuries have been very little studied, despite their
    importance, both for the history of the Orthodox Church as a
    whole, and for that of the Middle East in general. Discoveries
    of medieval wall paintings in Syria and Lebanon, as well as of
    hitherto unknown manuscripts, forgotten saints, and the
    identification of new Christian archaeological sites in recent
    years are just one indication of some of the new and unexpected
    aspects that are coming to light. At present, however,
    ‘Antioch’ is concentrating its attention on the
    very large number of manuscripts of Antiochian Orthodox
    provenance, written in four different languages, Greek, Syriac,
    Christian Palestinian Aramaic and Arabic. At the end of many of
    these the copyist has provided a colophon with notes stating
    where, when and for whom the manuscript was written; quite
    often, further information of a historical or topographical
    nature is also given. Work on these manuscripts has already
    brought to light a forgotten saint, besides providing a lot of
    new and valuable historical information. Once all this
    information has been collected together, it will make it
    possible to write a much more authoritative and reliable
    history of the Rum Orthodox Patriarchate of Antioch than is at
    present available.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P2"/>[2] At the
    present time ‘Antioch’ is supporting the research
    of Monk Elia Khalifeh, an Orthodox monk from Lebanon who is
    currently residing in Oxford, where he is able to benefit from
    the resources of the University’s libraries, above all
    from its manuscripts and its collection of microfilms from St
    Catherine’s Monastery, Sinai. He has already made an
    inventory of several thousand manuscripts in Syriac, Christian
    Palestinian Aramaic and Arabic, and is in the process of
    entering all the varied information contained in their
    colophons into a carefully designed data base. The aim of
    ‘Antioch’ is eventually to be able to make all this
    information available to scholars in the form of a fully
    searchable database, as well as to support and publish research
    on the Antiochian Orthodox heritage in general. In due course
    it is hoped that it will also be possible to organize
    conferences on the Antiochian Orthodox tradition, and, ideally,
    to establish a physical Centre to further promote research and
    to facilitate the dissemination of knowledge about this
    neglected and little-known tradition to a wider public.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P3"/>[3] Needless
    to say, the future success and development of
    ‘Antioch’ depends on financial support for its
    work. Further information about ‘Antioch’ in
    general, and about how to support it, can be found on its
    website, <ref target="http://www.AntiochCentre.net/">www.AntiochCentre.net</ref>.</p>

            <anchor corresp="P1"/>[1] Judah
    Benzion 'Ben' Segal, scholar of semitic languages, born June 21
    1912; died October 23 2003.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P2"/>[2] Judah
    "Ben" Segal, who has died aged 91, was a leading scholar in the
    field of Aramaic and Hebrew studies. He was professor of
    semitic languages at the School of Oriental and African Studies
    (SOAS), in the University of London, from 1961 until his
    retirement in 1979.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P3"/>[3] Among
    much else, he was largely responsible for a degree course that
    allowed students to study all the major languages of the
    semitic family, including Arabic, Hebrew, Aramaic, Akkadian and
    Ethiopic. This course, which sadly no longer exists, was unique
    in a British university at the time, and provided an excellent
    training for those who wished to undertake a research degree in
    semitic philology. It ensured that students gained a thorough
    knowledge of the languages and were able to read the most
    challenging texts, rather than simply learning "about" the
    languages.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P4"/>[4] Segal's
    own research was wide ranging. Several of his publications
    concerned the Christian Aramaic dialect known as Syriac, and
    the culture and literature of eastern Christianity. His first
    book, <hi rend="italic">The Diacritical Point and the Accents in Syriac</hi>
    (1953), a study of the vowels of Syriac, is greatly admired by
    semitic philologists and often regarded as one of his best
    works.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P5"/>[5] In 1970,
    he published <hi rend="italic">Edessa: The Blessed City,</hi> an erudite but
    very accessible historical study of the city of Edessa, modern
    Urfa in southern Turkey, where the Syriac language had its
    origins. He also made major contributions in the field of
    Hebrew and Jewish history; his book <hi rend="italic">The Hebrew Passover
    from the Earliest Times to AD 70</hi> (1963) quickly became a
    standard work.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P6"/>[6] In
    retirement, Segal continued his scholarly research with
    considerable energy. In 1981, he was awarded a Leverhulme
    emeritus fellowship, which allowed him to conduct research in
    India on the Jews of Cochin, resulting in the publication, in
    1993, of his definitive work on the subject, <hi rend="italic">A History of
    the Jews of Cochin.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P7"/>[7] He also
    continued to make important contributions to Aramaic studies
    through his publication of <hi rend="italic">Aramaic texts from North
    Saqqara, with some Fragments in Phoenician</hi> (1983) and his
    <hi rend="italic">Catalogue of the Aramaic and Mandaic Incantation Bowls in
    the British Museum</hi> (2000, in collaboration with Erica
    Hunter).</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P8"/>[8] Born in
    Newcastle, Segal was educated at Magdalen College school,
    Oxford, and graduated with a first-class tripos degree in
    Oriental languages from Cambridge University in 1935. He
    returned to Oxford to study for a research degree, and was
    awarded a DPhil there in 1939. His outstanding ability won him
    a series of prizes and scholarships.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P9"/>[9] Most of
    his later academic colleagues and students were not aware that
    he had distinguished himself in action during the second world
    war, to the extent that, in 1942, he had been awarded the
    Military Cross for bravery.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P10"/>[10]
    Earlier that year, he was sent more than 100 miles behind
    German lines in north Africa to report on the movements of
    Rommel's forces, and give advance warnings of planned attacks.
    He spent several weeks in secret hideouts with local Arabs,
    whose language he could speak. His regular reports helped save
    many allied lives. Narrowly avoiding capture on several
    occasions, he led an operation that resulted in the capture of
    the Libyan town of Derna, which proved to be crucial for the
    advance of Montgomery's 8th Army.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P11"/>[11]
    After the war, Segal pursued an academic career, as had his
    father, the distinguished Hebrew scholar M.H. Segal. In 1946,
    he joined SOAS, where he spent his entire career, as a lecturer
    in Hebrew and Aramaic, was promoted to reader in 1955, and took
    a chair in semitic languages in 1961. In 1968, he was elected
    to a fellowship of the British Academy.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P12"/>[12] It
    was my privilege to be his student at SOAS in the late 1970s,
    and I was, at first, overawed at being taught by a scholar of
    such eminence and erudition. Segal's quiet, gentle approach,
    however, soon made me feel completely at ease. In those days,
    more importance was attached to passing on scholarship to a
    younger generation than to maximising the number of students in
    the class. Indeed, I was often the only student on the courses
    that he taught.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P13"/>[13] His
    public-spiritedness was demonstrated on numerous occasions,
    especially when, at the age of 70, he agreed to become director
    of the progressive London Jewish seminary, Leo Baeck College,
    and worked resolutely to save it from imminent closure.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P14"/>[14] His
    wife Leah, whom he married in 1946, survives him, as do their
    two daughters.</p>_______<lb/>

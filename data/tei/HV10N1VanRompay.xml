            <p>In response to an invitation by the General
    Editor, the paper reflects on the present state of Syriac
    studies as well as on the opportunities and challenges of the
    future. In addition to a brief discussion of the geographical
    changes in the worldwide presence of Syriac Christians and
    Syriac scholars, some suggestions are offered for work to be
    carried out in the coming years. The paper closes with some
    thoughts on the academic study of Syriac.</p>

         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P1"/>[1] The
    Syriac Institute, <ref target="http://www.bethmardutho.org/">Beth Mardutho</ref> (formerly: The Syriac
    Computing Institute), and the web-based journal Hugoye will
    forever be remembered as marking the entrance of Syriac studies
    into the electronic age. The elegant Meltho fonts produced by
    Beth Mardutho and their Unicode application bring Syriac texts
    to our computer screens daily; now, it is hard to imagine what
    our lives would be like without them. For middle-aged Syriac
    scholars — like the present writer — who had to
    overcome their initial skepticism and fear of change, these
    quite radical developments took place in the last two decades.
    What remains to be expected, wished or dreamed for in the
    coming decade? Which other advancements does the future have in
    store for us? How will the technological progress impact our
    scholarship, and, likewise, how will our scholarship impact the
    developing technology?</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P2"/>[2] In this
    time of rapid change, it is an impossible task to make
    predictions about the future. Instead, I would prefer to share
    with the Hugoye readers some thoughts about the developments in
    our field, and some suggestions about what could be achieved in
    the coming years. Once in a while it is useful to look back and
    ahead; Hugoye’s tenth anniversary is an excellent
    opportunity to do just that.<ref target="#FN1">1</ref> I will briefly discuss three
    topics. First, the geographical and sociological changes taking
    place among Syriac Christians as well as among students and
    scholars. Second, I will highlight tools for teaching and
    research that need to be created. And third, I will speak in a
    more general way about the present state of the academic study
    of Syriac Christian culture.</p>
         <head xml:id="HV10N1VanRompay3">Changing Geography: Changing Experiences and
    Changing Interests</head>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P3"/>[3] There
    can be no doubt that geographical changes will further mark the
    development of Syriac studies in the coming years. In addition
    to a number of universities in Europe, North America, South
    Africa, and Australia, important centers of study and culture
    have always existed in the Middle East, the home of Syriac
    Christianity. Housed in monasteries or institutes of education,
    and often having important manuscript collections at their
    disposal, these Middle Eastern centers played an important role
    in the intellectual and cultural emancipation of Syriac
    Christians throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.
    They also contributed to the development of Syriac studies in
    Europe. The names of Ignatius Ephrem Barsom (d. 1957),
    Philoxenus Yuhanon Dolobani (d. 1969), Addai Scher (d. 1915),
    and Ignatius Ephrem Rahmani (d. 1929) come to mind, among many
    others: important leaders and scholars within their respective
    communities, they also interacted and collaborated with Western
    scholars. Their work, as well as their living example, remains
    important today.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P4"/>[4] While
    active centers producing fine scholars and important
    publications still exist in the Middle East, there has been a
    setback in recent years, mainly for two reasons. First, due to
    the political instability in the Middle East, local working
    conditions are often far from ideal and contacts with the West
    sometimes difficult. Second, Christians from the various Syriac
    traditions continue to leave the Middle Eastern countries for
    destinations in the West, thus depriving the local communities
    of much of their human and intellectual capital. Throughout the
    twentieth century, Syriac Christian communities paid a
    disproportionate price in turbulent Middle Eastern areas, and
    — it is sad to say — they continue to do so in the
    first years of the twenty-first century. One hopes that the
    centers of Syriac Christian culture in Lebanon, Syria, and Iraq
    will be able to recover and to regain some of their historical
    role; one hopes, too, that the monuments, libraries, and
    manuscript collections will be preserved and receive the
    attention they badly need. Syriac Christians and scholars alike
    will never give up their focus on the historic homelands of
    Syriac Christianity, but it has to be admitted that the
    presence of Syriac Christianity has significantly weakened.
    Quite interestingly, in Turkey there seem to be the first signs
    that the tide may be turning. Some Christians who left their
    homeland several years ago are beginning to return and to
    rebuild their lives there. In many ways there now seem to be
    new and better opportunities for Syriac Christianity as well as
    for the historical study of the Syriac monuments and manuscript
    resources.<ref target="#FN2">2</ref>
         </p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P5"/>[5] From the
    viewpoint of students and scholars, the decline of Syriac
    Christianity in the Middle East has been compensated (to a
    degree) by developments elsewhere. First, there are the
    flourishing communities in Kerala, India. Not only do these
    communities fully take up the historic legacy of Syriac
    Christianity, but they also have developed a number of
    important initiatives for the preservation and study of the
    Syriac traditions. The St. Ephrem Ecumenical Research Institute
    (SEERI) at Kottayam, Kerala, continues to play a vital role in
    these developments. Second, there is much activity in the
    Diaspora communities of Europe, North and South America, and
    Australia. As some of these communities include people of the
    second, third, or fourth generation, patterns of religious and
    cultural life are already well-established. In addition,
    contacts and fruitful interaction between the Diaspora
    communities and the homelands are maintained.<ref target="#_ftn3">3</ref> The hierarchies
    of the historic churches have learned to deal with the Diaspora
    situation, adjusting their policies in order to improve
    communication with their faithful in far-off lands, and to make
    full use of the new opportunities. The global landscape of
    Syriac Christianity will continue to change in the coming
    years. It is to be expected, however, that in the process of
    shaping their own religious and cultural identity, the Diaspora
    communities will continue to cherish their historic heritage
    and to study it. Links between Diaspora communities and
    academic centers in Western countries have been forged in the
    past — Beth Mardutho and Hugoye are illustrations of this
    — and such links are likely to grow in the coming
    years.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P6"/>[6] New
    centers of Syriac studies are emerging in some of the countries
    of the former Soviet Union: in Russia and in several East
    European countries. In some cases, earlier centers of Oriental
    or Early Christian studies are being brought to new life,
    making use of the existing manuscript and library resources; in
    other cases it is just the curiosity and enthusiasm of students
    and professors that led to the discovery, or rediscovery, of
    Syriac Christianity, and to the modest beginnings of an
    appropriate academic infrastructure.<ref target="#FN4">4</ref>
         </p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P7"/>[7] None of
    these new developments — in the Middle East, Turkey,
    India, the Diaspora communities, or Russia and Eastern Europe
    — will leave the traditional study in Western academic
    centers unaffected. New research interests will develop,
    hitherto neglected fields will be explored, and, hopefully, new
    forms of interaction and international cooperation will be
    established. Hugoye, with its easy access to readers and
    contributors everywhere on earth, will not only reflect these
    changes but help to shape them.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P8"/>[8] The
    potential of Syriac studies, therefore, may be said to be
    richer than ever before. New students and new researchers,
    having geographic, cultural, and educational backgrounds and
    experiences quite different from those of the traditional
    <hi rend="italic">mestaryonê</hi>, will find their own topics and their
    own methodologies, and they will infuse new blood into our
    discipline. History will have its course and does not need to
    be predicted or guessed at here. Let us only express the wish
    that we will find the best possible ways of dealing with the
    new challenges and the new opportunities.<ref target="#FN5">5</ref>
         </p>
         <head xml:id="HV10N1VanRompay4">Syriac Studies: The Core Fields, and the Basic
    Tools for the Study of Language and Literature</head>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P9"/>[9] To
    whatever new research questions and new methodologies these
    recent developments will lead, the core of Syriac scholarship
    will remain the study of the language — our only means of
    communication with Syriac Christians of earlier days —
    and the interpretation of texts. Admittedly, an impressive
    number of new texts have been published and translated in
    recent decades, but when it comes to the basic tools of
    language and literature, it is difficult to argue that the
    present-day student is much better off than her or his fellow
    students of eighty or hundred years ago. Eighty-five years
    after A. Baumstark’s <hi rend="italic">Geschichte der syrischen
    Literatur</hi> (1922), we still don’t have an updated
    history of Syriac literature. And the best we can do in the
    fields of grammar and lexicography is to put our hands on the
    works of the masters of old, which often exist in beautifully
    executed reprints: Theodor Nöldeke’s
    grammar,<ref target="#FN6">6</ref> and the dictionaries by Carl Brockelmann (second
    edition, 1928), Robert Payne Smith (1879-1901, with a
    Supplement posthumously published in 1927), and Jessie Payne
    Smith (first published in 1903). I am not suggesting that no
    significant progress has been made. As a matter of fact, we now
    have a number of excellent concordances, in particular for the
    Old Testament and New Testament Peshitta, to which most
    recently <hi rend="italic">A Key-Word-in-Context Concordance</hi> of the Old
    Syriac Gospels, by J.S. Lund (in collaboration with G.A.
    Kiraz), was added (2004). Much more, however, can and should be
    done, in particular when we consider the fact that the new
    technologies allow the manipulation of large amounts of data.
    Here I would like to single out three concrete projects, for
    each of which important steps have already been taken. My
    suggestions concern the Syriac <hi rend="italic">lexicon</hi>, <hi rend="italic">textual
    corpora</hi>, and an <hi rend="italic">encyclopedic</hi> project.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P10"/>[10] For
    some decades, considerable knowledge and experience in Aramaic
    and Syriac lexicography have been built up within the
    <hi rend="italic">Comprehensive Aramaic Lexicon</hi> project, presently based
    at Hebrew Union College in Cincinnati, Ohio. It is within the
    framework of this project that we soon will have at our
    disposal a new edition of C. Brockelmann’s <hi rend="italic">Lexicon
    Syriacum</hi>, translated into English, revised, and slightly
    updated by Michael Sokoloff. Along with two other outstanding
    dictionaries by Sokoloff, covering the neighboring fields of
    Jewish Palestinian Aramaic and Jewish Babylonian Aramaic
    — both of direct relevance to students of Syriac! —
    the new Brockelmann &amp; Sokoloff will pave the way for the
    creation of new and up-to-date tools in the field of Syriac
    lexicography. Discussions for new projects are also in the
    works.<ref target="#FN7">7</ref>
         </p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P11"/>[11]
    Related to this is the need for searchable textual corpora for
    different purposes: lexical, linguistic, and thematic. Would it
    not be wonderful to be able to search the writings of Ephrem,
    Jacob of Serug, Narsai, Jacob of Edessa, and
    Isho<hi rend="sup">
               <hi rend="italic">c</hi>
            </hi>dad of Merv? The <hi rend="italic">Leiden Armenian
    Lexical Database</hi>, created by Jos Weitenberg at Leiden
    University, and the <hi rend="italic">Thesaurus Linguae Graecae</hi>, based
    at the University of California at Irvine, come to mind as
    obvious models.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P12"/>[12] The
    third type of database I would like briefly to mention is of a
    quite different nature. For several years students of Syriac
    have been talking about the need for a Syriac
    Encyclopedia,<ref target="#_ftn8">8</ref> and concrete steps have been taken towards
    creating an “Encyclopedic Dictionary of the Syriac
    Heritage,” as a publication within the Beth Mardutho
    program. Although much work has been done, and a considerable
    number of entries have been submitted, final execution of the
    work has been delayed. While it is true that the field of
    Syriac is partly covered in a number of existing encyclopedias
    — dealing with Late Antiquity, Early Christianity,
    Eastern Christianity, or Near Eastern studies — none of
    these do justice to our field as a whole, and in its own right.
    There can be no doubt that an encyclopedia, created by a team
    of Syriac scholars, and aimed at students and scholars of
    Syriac as well as at a larger readership, will serve as an
    indispensable frame of reference, will inspire and guide young
    students, and will greatly enhance the visibility of our field.
    The existing, though somewhat dormant project, therefore,
    should be awakened urgently and forcefully. The encyclopedia
    should cover the earlier as well as the later and contemporary
    periods, and should include ample references to adjacent fields
    and disciplines, as the strength of Syriac studies lies in its
    multidisciplinarity and in its interconnectedness with other
    fields, rather than in its isolation.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P13"/>[13] In
    order to make the project manageable, short- and long-term
    goals should be set. On the one hand, we should work towards
    the publication of a modest encyclopedic dictionary containing
    between three and four hundred entries. This could be published
    within a year or so, as many of the entries already are
    available and need only minor updates. On the other hand, we
    should keep working on a larger electronic database, in which
    many of the existing articles can be introduced as a starting
    point, but which should be expanded in the coming years. The
    more comprehensive electronic database can be more detailed and
    can include discussion of existing scholarship, whereas the
    printed dictionary will be more succinct and only provide basic
    information.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P14"/>[14] The
    “Encyclopedic Dictionary of the Syriac Heritage,”
    in its two phases as proposed here, is not one of the many
    desiderata in the field of Syriac studies; rather, it is a
    concrete project that already has been created and waits to be
    carried out. There is no justification for further delay.</p>
         <head xml:id="HV10N1VanRompay5">Syriac Studies: Texts, Authors, Opportunities and
    Limitations</head>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P15"/>[15] In
    1947, the Belgian Syriac scholar Jacques-Marie Vosté,
    who then was professor at the Angelicum in Rome, published a
    paper, entitled “De la besogne pour les jeunes
    syriacisants.”<ref target="#_ftn9">9</ref> In it he listed what he regarded as —
    and mainly within his own field of expertise — the most
    urgent tasks for young Syriac scholars. This publication turned
    out to be Vosté’s spiritual testament, for he died
    one year later (at the age of 66). For us, reading it sixty
    years later, the paper is an important historical piece. Not
    only is it interesting to see which items in
    Vosté’s list have received scholarly attention and
    which have not, it is also worthwhile to notice the different
    conditions that prevailed in Syriac studies in
    Vosté’s day. Throughout the paper,
    Vosté’s enthusiasm is moving: to the young
    scholars he promises a life full of excitement and happiness;
    to the universities supporting them, he promises fame, the
    whole world’s gratitude, and even some financial gain. I
    wish we could share in more of Vosté’s
    optimism!</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P16"/>[16]
    Given his background in biblical and exegetical studies, it is
    no surprise that editions of biblical texts rank high on
    Vosté’s wish list. He singled out as most urgent
    the need for an edition of the Old Testament Peshitta and of
    the New Testament Harklean version. In both areas
    Vosté’s suggestions were taken up by later
    scholars. The Old Testament Peshitta edition, begun by the
    Leiden Peshitta Institute not long after Vosté wrote, is
    expected to be completed in the next couple of years. The
    project thus will have lasted fifty years, rather than “a
    few years” (<hi rend="italic">quelques années</hi>), as
    Vosté predicted (p. 175). The study of the Harklean New
    Testament has been integrated within the work of the Institute
    for New Testament Research of the University of Münster.
    Here again, the problems turned out to be much more complex
    than first could be anticipated.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P17"/>[17] As
    Syriac scholars we may wholeheartedly agree with
    Vosté’s prediction that the universities that
    would undertake such editions “would cover themselves
    with glory” (p. 174), but present-day university
    administrators tend to look elsewhere for their glory.
    Vosté calculated that the universities would fully
    recover their financial investment in the form of the royalties
    they would earn from the unique publications that were going to
    be produced (p. 175). Experience has taught us otherwise!
    Universities no longer want to assume a Maecenas role for the
    arts and the humanities; instead, they have become business
    enterprises in which Syriac studies are seen as marginal at
    best. Projects in Syriac studies, as in the humanities in
    general, have to go through cumbersome procedures and heavy
    competition in order to get external funding. Successful
    projects normally are not limited to Syriac, but are embedded
    in much broader, multidisciplinary frameworks.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P18"/>[18]
    Perhaps now even more than in Vosté’s day Syriac
    studies owe their strength to the commitment and perseverance
    of individuals. Apart from the two aforementioned team
    projects, in which the universities of Leiden and Münster
    were — and to a certain extent still are — directly
    involved, other editions that Vosté suggested were
    subsequently carried out by individuals. This is the case for
    the edition of the Old Testament Commentary by
    Isho<hi rend="sup">
               <hi rend="italic">c</hi>
            </hi>dad of Merv, to which Vosté
    himself gave much of his last strength. The first volume,
    containing the Syriac text of the Genesis Commentary, was
    published in 1950, co-authored by Vosté and his much
    younger Louvain confrère Ceslas Van den Eynde. Van den
    Eynde continued on his own and completed the work in a series
    of splendid editions and translations (1955-1981).<ref target="#FN10">10</ref>
    Another East-Syriac exegetical compilation, the <hi rend="italic">Gannat
    Bussâmê</hi> (“The Garden of
    Delights”), arranged according to the periods of the
    liturgical year, which Vosté saw as a veritable gold
    mine — promising “la plus grande
    satisfaction” to those who would study it (p. 180)
    — has been meticulously explored by G.J. Reinink
    (University of Groningen), who now is in the process of
    producing a full edition with translation, the first volume of
    which appeared in 1988.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P19"/>[19]
    Other texts recommended by Vosté for publication and
    translation have received little attention so far. This is true
    for the writings of the Syrian Orthodox author Jacob (Severus)
    bar Shakko (p. 183), who worked a few decades before
    Barhebraeus, as well as for a number of liturgical texts (pp.
    184-185). Other areas referred to by Vosté in a more
    general way are hagiographical, ascetical, and mystical
    literature. In poetry Vosté singles out Narsai, Jacob of
    Serug, and Giwargis Warda: several of Narsai’s
    <hi rend="italic">Mêmrê</hi> remain unpublished, and, while Jacob
    of Serug has fared better than Narsai (especially after the
    2006 expanded reprint of Bedjan’s five-volume edition),
    Giwargis Warda remains very little studied to this day.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P20"/>[20]
    Vosté’s selection of texts was clearly determined
    by his work on the collections of East-Syriac manuscripts in
    Iraq, which suffered losses and destruction during and after
    World War I. In the course of his work in Iraq, he located and
    briefly described a number of manuscripts (namely those of
    Alqosh, Kirkuk, and <hi rend="sup">
               <hi rend="italic">c</hi>
            </hi>Aqra), lamented the
    definitive loss of others, and rescued some to the Vatican
    Library. Unfortunately, the Syriac manuscripts of Iraq are
    still not secure. Their proper documentation and preservation
    are badly needed. Moreover, in the last decade of the twentieth
    century as well as in the first years of the twenty-first
    century new catastrophes do not cease to threaten them.
    <hi rend="italic">L’histoire se répète</hi> — sadly
    and almost unbearably!</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P21"/>[21] The
    lack and desirability of editions, translations, and studies
    are not limited to the texts listed by Vosté. Each of us
    could easily make a list. I would like to single out a few
    names. A full edition of the works of John the Solitary of
    Apamea, one of the most fascinating authors of the early period
    of Syriac Christianity, is still missing. No general studies of
    his world of thought or sources exist. This is all the more
    surprising as there is a growing interest in asceticism in the
    Syriac and late ancient world, and John really brings an
    original voice to the world of fifth-century asceticism. The
    same is true for Jacob of Edessa, one of the most learned
    authors of Syriac literature and probably its best Hellenist.
    Here again, there is no lack of interest in his works, but a
    number of them remain unpublished and no overall monograph is
    available.<ref target="#FN11">11</ref> The works of many of the later authors are
    still lingering in manuscripts. What about Moses bar Kepha,
    Dionysius bar Salibi, Emmanuel bar Shahhârê,
    Yohannan bar Zo<hi rend="sup">
               <hi rend="italic">c</hi>
            </hi>bi, Khamis bar
    Qardâhê, and Gabriel Qamsâ? Some parts of
    their works have been published or studied, often long ago, but
    no recent progress has been made. How to explain this lack of
    initiative, this lack of energy on the part of Syriac
    scholars?</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P22"/>[22] It
    is true that text editions and translations do not always have
    a positive reputation in the academic discourse, and that
    doctoral candidates often find it more attractive (or are even
    actively encouraged) to study a specific theme of Syriac
    Christianity on the basis of already published and translated
    texts. This tendency toward the monograph over and against the
    text edition and translation is to be regretted. Especially in
    the case of previously unedited and unpublished Syriac texts,
    there is no substantive academic foundation for the lack of
    prestige in executing such studies. The disclosure and the
    first interpretation of texts seem to me to be the noblest task
    of Syriac scholars, a task we should cherish above anything
    else. It is imperative, therefore, that we keep the standards
    of Syriac education high — in particular its linguistic
    and literary components — in order to allow future
    generations of Syriac scholars to carry out their work with the
    same rigor as the best editors and translators of the past.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P23"/>[23]
    There may be an additional problem here, as the present-day
    requirements of many academic programs are so complex and
    wide-ranging that the basic study of languages and literatures
    is often given short shrift. This brings us back to the problem
    of the marginal position of Syriac in many universities. One
    can find students of Syriac in very different academic
    departments: religion, history, and art departments, and
    programs in Near Eastern Studies, Semitic Studies, and Arabic
    or Islamic studies. Though the focus of a dissertation may be
    entirely on Syriac, in the preliminary stages of a doctoral
    program many other topics, languages, and methodologies will
    have to be learned. While I am convinced that Syriac has its
    proper place in all these different departments, and that
    Syriac studies greatly benefit from these diverse contexts,
    there is the possible problem of time pressure, the more so as
    university administrators are increasingly eager to abbreviate
    the number of years students spend in Ph.D. programs.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P24"/>[24] Many
    of us will have noticed that in recent years symposia and
    conferences on Syriac topics are well-attended by a wonderful
    crowd of enthusiastic people with very different backgrounds
    — reflecting the healthy diversity hinted at above. This
    often leads to fascinating discussions and enriching
    encounters. One also realizes, however, that many of the
    attendees, while enthusiastically dealing with matters Syriac
    from a variety of angles, have only a limited knowledge of the
    Syriac language or no knowledge at all. We should not complain
    too much about this, as it is one of the consequences of the
    growing popularity of Syriac studies in recent years. Moreover,
    we may learn from the viewpoint of experts in different fields,
    even if they are not as strong in the Syriac language as we
    would like them to be. But there is a risk that Syriac texts
    are used without much precision or are quoted in translations
    without being checked against the Syriac original.
    Unfortunately there even have been some lamentable examples of
    poor, or less than poor, Syriac in recently published
    monographs. For several reasons — some of which mentioned
    above — it may not always be easy for students to learn
    Syriac, or to find experts with whom to discuss the specific
    problems posed by the texts with which they are dealing. In
    addition, as pointed out above, the tools for learning Syriac
    are less than ideal.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P25"/>[25]
    There seems to be a real challenge here, which poses itself
    equally to Syriac scholars and to all those who are interested
    in Syriac Christian culture. On the one hand, we should let the
    Hidden Pearl be revealed to anyone who is interested in
    discovering it and learning from it. On the other hand, in
    dealing with Syriac texts we should never desist from applying
    the highest possible standards. Even though our understanding
    and interpretation of ancient texts will always be incomplete
    and provisional — every generation of scholars offering
    new insights differing from those of the previous generations
    — the language should be studied in its full depth and be
    taken as the solid starting point for any discussion. Proper
    study of language and style should always be an integral part
    of our engagement with Syriac texts. May our field further grow
    and flourish in the coming ten years and beyond! May Hugoye
    bring and keep us together both in the real world and in
    cyberspace!<ref target="#FN12">12</ref>

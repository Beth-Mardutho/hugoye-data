                <p xml:lang="en">Over the last nine years, a forty-seven-person digital humanities
                    project has explored the feasibility of computer assisted paleography for Syriac.
                    That is, could one use big data, visual analytics, and recent advances in the
                    digital analysis of handwriting to better understand Syriac manuscripts and Syriac
                    manuscript culture? Last June we launched the public-facing part of our project
                    titled the “Digital Analysis of Syriac Handwriting” or DASH (<ref
                        target="http://dash.Stanford.edu">dash.Stanford.edu</ref>). DASH consists of
                    digital page images from 90% of the world’s surviving Syriac manuscripts securely
                    dated to before the twelfth century, as well as 90,000 individually trimmed letters
                    from these manuscripts. In addition to introducing this tool to scholars of Syriac,
                    this article presents a series of novel visualization tools that can also serve as a
                    starting point for digital paleography projects in other linguistic traditions.</p>

            <p xml:lang="en">Thanks in large part to the libraries of Deir al-Surian and
                Saint Catherine’s monasteries, Syriac has a surprisingly high number of very early
                manuscripts. Syriac scribes also included dated colophons in their works much more
                frequently than scribes from other traditions.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn1" n="1"
                        ><p xml:lang="en"> Sebastian Brock, "Without Mushê of Nisibis, Where Would
                        We Be?" <hi rend="italic">Journal of Eastern Christian Studies</hi> 56
                        (2004): 15-24.</p></note> As a result, there is a truly impressive set of
                early, securely dated Syriac manuscripts.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn2" n="2"><p
                        xml:lang="en"> For example, 14% of the 615 British Library manuscripts
                        thought to have been written in the first millennium include a securely
                        dated colophon. When extended to all fifth- through nineteenth-century
                        Syriac manuscripts, the proportion of those with securely dated colophons
                        increases to approximately 30% (Sebastian P Brock and David G.K. Taylor, <hi
                            rend="italic">The Hidden Pearl: The Syrian Orthodox Church and Its
                            Ancient Aramaic Heritage</hi>, v.2. [Rome: Trans World Film Italia,
                        2001], 245). By comparison, among Hebrew manuscripts the percentage with
                        dated colophons is just 3.4%, that is almost ten times less frequent than in
                        Syriac manuscripts (Malachi Beit-Arié, <hi rend="italic">Hebrew Codicology:
                            Historical and Comparative Typology of Hebrew Medieval Codices Based on
                            the Documentation of the Extant Dated Manuscripts from a Quantitative
                            Approach Pre-Publication, Internet Version 0.1</hi>, 2012). The
                        comparative frequency by which Syriac works include a dated colophon results
                        in a total of 148 extant Syriac codices having a secure date before 1001. In
                        comparison, Armenian—although with a total manuscript corpus about 50%
                        larger than Syriac—has just fifteen manuscripts securely dated to the first
                        millennium (Michael E. Stone, Dickran Kouymjian, and Henning Lehmann. <hi
                            rend="italic">Album of Armenian Paleography</hi> [Aarhus, Denmark:
                        Aarhus University Press, 2002], 512). Hebrew with a total corpus
                        approximately five times larger than Syriac has eleven (Colette Sirat and N.
                        R. M. De Lange. <hi rend="italic">Hebrew Manuscripts of the Middle Ages</hi>
                        [Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2002] 11).</p></note> But in Syriac
                Studies there remains a disconnect between this plethora of early manuscripts and
                the lack of paleographic resources to help modern scholars analyze them. Several
                recent articles and an unpublished dissertation have addressed some aspects of
                Syriac script.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn3" n="3"><p xml:lang="en"> E.g. <hi

                            rend="italic">Chester Beatty</hi> 701; <hi rend="italic">Harvard Syriac
                        </hi>176; <hi rend="italic">Paris Syriac</hi> 169). Removed <hi
                            rend="italic">St. Petersburg N/S</hi> 24 as the folio is too damaged to
                        ensure that the date that appears without much context in the colophon is a
                        composition date. Removed <hi rend="italic">Mingana Syriac</hi> 106G as the
                        stray leaves Mingana identified are no longer locatable in the University of
                        Birmingham collection.</p></note> Even more limiting, however, is the very
                format of an album. When modern scholars use Hatch's book, they are constrained to
                the unit of an individual manuscript page. For example, when confronted with the
                task of estimating the composition date for a manuscript of interest, one often
                flips through Hatch's <hi rend="italic">Album</hi> searching for a similar looking
                manuscript page among Hatch's samples. But, often the desired unit of comparison is
                not an entire manuscript page, rather individual letter forms. In essence, to use
                Hatch's <hi rend="italic">Album</hi> one has to compare the <hi rend="italic"
                    >olaphs</hi> in each manuscript with those of the document in question. Then it
                is time for the <hi rend="italic">beths</hi>, at which point one forgets most of the
                    <hi rend="italic">olaphs</hi>, and so on. Even if one successfully determines
                the most analogous page, the same procedure needs repeating as soon as one is
                interested in a different manuscript. </p>
            <p xml:lang="en">The field of Syriac Studies has advanced greatly in the last seventy-five years. It
                makes little sense for our knowledge of Syriac paleography to remain almost entirely
                dependent on Hatch’s 1946 <hi rend="italic">Album</hi> or—given the inherent
                limitations—any print publication. Thanks to support from the Andrew Mellon
                Foundation, the American Council of Learned Societies, and the Stanford University
                Library, we assembled a team of Syriac scholars, paleographers, computer scientists,
                software developers, and dozens of research assistants to help address this issue
                through the creation of an on-line tool we entitled the Digital Analysis of Syriac
                Handwriting or DASH.</p>
            <p xml:lang="en">We began the DASH project by compiling the world’s largest image collection of
                securely dated Syriac manuscripts. Currently, DASH contains digital images from 156
                of the 183 extant Syriac manuscripts securely dated to before 1101 (that is 85%),
                along with permissions for their public display.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn7"

                <head>The Back-End Interface: Identifying Individual Syriac Letters</head>
                <p xml:lang="en">Paleographers are often interested not simply in entire manuscript pages but also
                    individual letters. When designing DASH, we found it essential—unlike in Hatch’s
                        <hi rend="italic">Album</hi>—to include images not only of entire manuscript
                    pages but also of individual letters. Despite recent advances in the optical
                    character recognition of Syriac, especially of printed text, the OCR of Syriac
                    manuscript handwriting is still in its infancy. As a result, our collection of
                    individual Syriac letter images stems from manual identification. To compile
                    this dataset, our team created in Python a “behind the scenes” back-end DASH
                    interface that allows research assistants to rapidly identify multiple examples
                    of a given Syriac letter.</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">As shown in <hi rend="italic">Figure 1</hi>, a research assistant uses a
                    pull-down menu to select a specific manuscript page. They then choose a given
                    letter to identify. They next drag selection boxes around examples of that
                    letter. As they do this, the system records the coordinates of each selection
                    box along with appropriate metadata into a myseql database. After the research
                    assistant has identified several examples, they move on to another letter form,
                    another page, or another manuscript. </p>
                <p xml:lang="en">In our case, we hired almost two dozen research assistants who used the back-end
                    interface to place selection boxes around 132,476 Syriac letters. Employing the
                    boxes’ coordinates, the system later extracted each letter. Then, using custom
                    designed algorithms, one of our computer scientists binarized the images.<note

                    converted them into a black-and-white version particularly easy for humans and
                    computers to read. In order to produce a particularly clear letter image,
                    research assistants then used a simple graphics editor (GIMP) to remove any
                    remnants of adjacent letters or other stray marks. They then loaded the
                    single-letter image back into the database. Finally, scholars of Syriac proofed
                    these letter images—multiple times—eliminating misidentifications, mistrimmings,
                    or any images that were poorly binarized. The result was a particularly clean
                    dataset of 88,075 usable letter images. </p>

                <head>The Front-End Interface: Visualizing Securely Dated Manuscript and Letter
                    Images</head>
                <p xml:lang="en">As part of a larger digital paleography endeavor, our team collected letter data
                    from over a thousand Syriac codices. For the publicly facing side of the
                    project, however, we prioritized images coming from those manuscripts securely
                    dated before the twelfth century. Even this smaller sample is a large set of
                    visual data and raised the question how best to display these images for
                    researchers. We designed DASH primarily for scholars of Syriac. However, we also
                    wanted to create an interface that could serve as a model for digital
                    paleography in other linguistic traditions. As a result, when building the
                    front-end interface we kept several design goals in mind. </p>
                <p xml:lang="en">When a human expert examines a physical manuscript, they do so at different
                    levels. For example, at times a paleographer concentrates on the level of one or
                    more complete manuscript pages. At other times they go to the level of a single
                    example of a given letter. Often, they focus on intermediate levels, such as how
                    two individual letters connect to each other or the slight differences between
                    multiple samples of a scribe writing the same letter form. Taking this as our
                    model, we desired an interface that would allow the digital scholar to
                    relatively seamlessly navigate between various levels of analysis ranging from
                    the macro (e.g. looking at multiple manuscript pages), to the micro (e.g. a
                    single letter image), to several levels in between. We also wanted to give the
                    researcher control over the complexity of the visualization, enabling them to at
                    first view particularly easy-to-see images and then to add greater context, or
                    to move in the other direction from complexity to simplicity. In data
                    visualization research, this paradigm is known as the Shneiderman Mantra:
                    “Overview First / Zoom &amp;amp; Filter /Details-on-Demand.”<note place="foot"
                        xml:id="ftn9" n="9"><p xml:lang="en"> Ben Shneiderman, “The Eyes Have It: A
                            Task by Data Type Taxonomy for Information Visualizations,” <hi
                                rend="italic">Proceedings 1996 IEEE Symposium on Visual
                                Languages</hi> (IEEE, 1996).</p></note></p>
                <p xml:lang="en">Our interface design also emphasized the comparative. At whatever level the
                    scholar was viewing the data, they should be able to compare what they were
                    seeing with other data. That is, if they were viewing a specific manuscript
                    page, we wanted the scholar to be able to simultaneously see pages from other
                    manuscripts. If viewing an individual letter form, we wanted the scholar to be
                    able to view multiple examples of that letter or to view letters from different
                    manuscripts next to each other. So, too, the interface should facilitate
                    explorations of how a given letter or set of letters developed over time.</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">Finally, we wanted an interface that was easy-to-use. It was to have an
                    intuitive, compact design. It ought to work not only on desktop machines and
                    laptops but also on tablets and phones. It needed to have basic help features
                    and to follow best principals of accessibility. It should have options allowing
                    one to easily share their discoveries with other researchers or embed them in a
                    publication.</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">At times these goals competed with each other. For example, keeping the interface
                    simple meant limiting some of the display options. At other times, budget
                    constraints meant the interface still has areas that could be expanded. As one
                    example, currently the interface provides very little metadata about a given
                    manuscript and the scholar instead has to consult the standard manuscript
                    catalogs. In the future we would like to link our project to others such as
                    syriaca.org’s forthcoming digital version of William Wright’s catalog of the
                    British Library’s Syriac manuscripts. Most of all, we want to revise the
                    interface in accord with suggestions scholars have sent us using the DASH
                    website’s contact form. Despite such limitations, it still felt appropriate to
                    publicize the project, both to enable researchers to begin using this on-line
                    tool and to solicit additional recommendations for its improvement.</p>

                    button.</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">Now one sees the publicly accessible interface with options on a collapsible
                    palette to the left and a tab on the right allowing one to move between the view
                    at the level of manuscript page or at the level of individual letters. As a
                    small case study, one can explore <hi rend="italic">British Library
                        Additional</hi> 12,149 which is a liturgical manuscript copied in 1006 CE by
                    the scribe Yeshua son of Andrew. After selecting the manuscript shelfmark on the
                    left palette and choosing to view the manuscript from the right tab, <hi
                        rend="italic">British Library Additional</hi> 12,149 opens in a Stanford
                    developed manuscript viewer called Mirador (<hi rend="italic">Figure 2</hi>).
                    Here one can toggle to full screen, zoom in and out of the manuscript image,
                    move around the manuscript page by simply dragging or using control arrows. One
                    can also open up a series of basic image tools to adjust brightness, contrast,
                    or color saturation, switch to greyscale, invert the color, or revert to the
                    original image. If a library has publicly accessible images in the IIIF format
                    that is becoming the worldwide standard for manuscript display (e.g. most
                    Vatican Library manuscripts), one can see all its pages. For the remainder, we
                    have permissions to display a few pages; that is one cannot read the book cover
                    to cover but will certainly have enough pages for paleographic analysis. </p>

                <p xml:lang="en">Up to this point, the project seems to be a glorified, digital version of Hatch’s
                        <hi rend="italic">Album</hi>, albeit with almost 50% more manuscripts,
                    multiple pages, better images, and the ability to zoom and modify the images.
                    Nevertheless, the overarching focus on a manuscript page remains. But if one
                    instead chooses the “script chart” tab the perspective quickly changes. As shown
                    in <hi rend="italic">Figure 3</hi>, the project instantly makes a custom
                    designed script chart. Here one can specify which letters to show, how many
                    examples, and the size of the resulting image. At first, one might view the
                    trimmed, binarized images as these make for a very clean chart. But, at the same
                    time, this very simplicity excludes information. As shown in <hi rend="italic"
                        >Figure 4</hi>, to help regain information one can also include the original
                    letter images prior to trimming and binarization. This gives more detail and is
                    still fairly clean. But it does not yet have much context. But, as <hi
                        rend="italic">Figure 5</hi> illustrates, hovering over any letter in the
                    chart allows one to see that same letter example, clearly marked in fluorescent
                    green. But now the letter includes the letters and lines that originally
                    surrounded that letter. If one wants more context, one can always go back to
                    viewing the entire manuscript page by clicking on the manuscripts tab. </p>

                        Showing a Letter in Context.</hi> Although a collection of single letters
                    creates a very clear script chart, it also eliminates many of the details that
                    are most important for paleographers. Hovering the cursor over any letter in the
                    script chart shows that specific letter example (which the interface highlights
                    in green) in a larger context. The scholar can help specify how large an area
                    surrounding the letter is displayed. This allows researchers to investigate
                    traits, such as how letters connect to each other, which would be hidden in a
                    single-letter script chart.</p>

                        Additional</hi> 12,148. This provides a rare opportunity to examine how
                    similar a given scribe’s handwriting is across manuscripts. <hi rend="italic"

                    Andrew’s two works appear in the manuscript viewer next to each other. If one
                    returns to the script chart, it now shows letter examples from both manuscripts,
                    allowing one to see how similar the individual letter forms actually are. But it
                    turns out that in the early eleventh century Joshua was actually quite busy and
                    he copied two additional manuscripts. By selecting all four shelf-marks one can
                    see, as in <hi rend="italic">Figure </hi>7, all four of Yeshua’s manuscripts at
                    one time. A return to the script chart (<hi rend="italic">Figure 8</hi>) shows

                    allow for easy comparison. In this case, all four manuscripts come from Yeshua
                    son of Andrew and show how little the scribe varied his handwriting between
                    documents. Alternatively, one can choose a given letter or series of letters and
                    display all securely dated examples of that form chronologically, essentially
                    creating a timeline for the development of Syriac script. © The British Library

                <p xml:lang="en">DASH also helps trace the chronological development of Syriac script. Instead of
                    specifying a single or small group of manuscripts, one can instead choose a
                    single letter and view how that letter form changes across all securely dated
                    manuscripts. Alternatively, one can view the development of multiple letter
                    forms in relationship to each other. As with other script charts, chronological
                    charts such as these retain the option of viewing any given letter example in
                    context or toggling to a full manuscript page.</p>

                    one can paste the URL into an article footnote (or use a Tiny URL to shrink it).

                <p xml:lang="en">In terms of Syriac Studies, DASH has had two overarching goals. First, the
                    project provides access to a much greater number of securely dated manuscript
                    pages than previously available. In this sense, it is an expansion of Hatch’s
                        <hi rend="italic">Album of Dated Syriac Manuscripts</hi>. The second,
                    field-specific goal can also be seen as an extension of Hatch’s book. Like
                    Hatch’s work almost seventy-five years ago, DASH is a designed to support other
                    scholars as they develop and implement their own studies of specific manuscripts
                    or of Syriac script more generally. </p>
                <p xml:lang="en">The project, however, also aspires to be of help outside of the field of Syriac
                    Studies. It uses Syriac manuscripts as an extended case study for exploring how
                    a wide range of visualization techniques might assist manuscript studies as a
                    whole. DASH thus illustrates a conceptual model for thinking beyond the
                    tradition of a printed manuscript album as the primary paleographic resource. As
                    an open source project, it also provides code that those in other subfields can
                    adopt and adapt for their own digital endeavors. </p>
                <p xml:lang="en">Scholars of Syriac are lucky to have a relatively large corpus of very early,
                    securely dated manuscripts. This not only facilitates the creation of
                    paleographic tools, it also makes their development that much more imperative.
                    We certainly would like the Digital Analysis of Syriac Handwriting project to be
                    of use to individual scholars and their research. Our greatest hope, however, is
                    that both for those who focus on Syriac manuscripts and for those who work in
                    other linguistic traditions, it might inspire additional projects in computer
                    assisted paleography. </p>

            <p>This paper is an attempt to collect
    together what is known about Nisibis before and during the life
    of Ephrem the Syrian (306-373). It is important to see him
    against the backdrop of the place that formed him rather than
    the place in which he spent the final years of his life, so it
    is to Nisibis that we should turn for insight into
    Ephrem’s basic thoughts and concerns. I hope that this
    information may stir readers to reflect on Ephrem as a child of
    his birthplace and to see him in a slightly different light
    than before.</p>

      Even of Nisibis, which was clearly the central place in the
      eastern part of the Mesopotamian shelf, we have only scraps
      of external information from the Parthian and earlier Roman
      period. The effect of our ignorance is above all that we can
      supply no significant context or background against which to
      set the writings of the greatest figure in early Syriac
      Christianity, Ephrem, born in Nisibis in the early years of
      the fourth century.<ref target="#FN1">1</ref>
         </quote>The study of early Syriac Christianity has
    centered on Edessa from the time that Eusebius made it
    prominent by including the Jesus/Abgar correspondence in his
    history of the Church.<ref target="#FN2">2</ref> Bauer’s use of Edessa and the
    documents about the early Church there<ref target="#FN3">3</ref> has tended to focus
    the attention of Western scholars on the degree of
    trustworthiness to be assigned to the Abgar legend. After
    having invested so much energy in a drawn-out discussion of the
    establishment of the Church in Edessa, moving to the unspoken
    assumption that that discussion covered the pre-literary
    history of Syriac-speaking Christianity has seemed a natural
    step. It is a misguided step, however.
    <p>
            <anchor corresp="P2"/>[2] The roll
    of very early Christian writings produced in Syriac that
    survive to our day is not a long one:  Sebastian
    Brock<ref target="#FN4">4</ref> lists three passages in <hi rend="italic">The Chronicle of
    Edessa</hi>, the inscription of Abercius of Hierapolis (died
    ca. 200), two passages from Julius Africanus, <hi rend="italic">The Book of
    the Laws of the Countries</hi>, the central elements in the
    martyr acts of Shmona, Guria and Habbib and what Dr. Brock
    calls “the scant fragments of Bardaisan’s works
    preserved by later polemicists” as forming the earliest
    stratum of evidence. With the exception of the very uncertain
    <hi rend="italic">Odes of Solomon</hi> and some probable, but lost, works
    lying behind <hi rend="italic">The Acts of Thomas</hi>, there is nothing else
    on which scholars can agree. These seem to be the chief of the
    surviving pieces from before the arrival on the scene of the
    two great fourth century contemporaries: Aphrahat and Ephrem.
    With their activities come the first large bodies of texts that
    survive to be mined for information on the life and thought of
    those early Semitic Christians.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P3"/>[3] Our
    problems are not solved by the arrival of these works on the
    stage of history, however. Instead, these writings confront us
    with new puzzles. Aphrahat seems destined to remain just a name
    to us, but Ephrem’s life and work can be studied as
    united elements of a single whole with a specific location in
    time and space. The enterprise of locating the particular
    pieces of this corpus, though, is fraught with difficulty, due
    to the lack of autobiographical references his works provide
    and the scarcity of earlier materials.<ref target="#FN5">5</ref> These circumstances
    make broad knowledge of the time and place in which Ephrem
    lived even more desirable, since that background could be a
    powerful light to shine on the works to help us see what they
    contain. Because of this, our knowledge of the city of Nisibis
    and the life of those living there, Christian and non-Christian
    alike, should hold a prominent place in the mind of any student
    of Ephrem. This has not been the case for most students of
    Ephrem, however.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P4"/>[4] Nisibis
    was Ephrem’s home and formative environment. He passed
    almost six decades of his life there before his exile in Edessa
    began. Despite this, even the basic emotional and psychological
    fact that Edessa can never have been “home” to him
    seems to have escaped the notice of modern readers of his
    works. Though both of these places are far from us in time and
    space and foreign to us in very similar ways, we should not let
    that similarity to the foreigner make us assume that they were
    much the same to Ephrem.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P5"/>[5] I would
    like to suggest that Nisibis should be the first place we look
    to find the background of Ephrem’s works rather than
    Edessa. The fact that he spent so much more of his life in
    Nisibis is important, of course, but it may be even more
    important to consider the fact that his formation as a human
    being, a Christian thinker and writer, and as an observer and
    analyzer of the world must all have taken place in Nisibis. In
    the same way that an American, born in the 1950s, can never
    escape some degree of mental connection between Germany and
    totalitarianism, because of its all-pervasiveness in
    conversation and writing during his formative years, so would
    Ephrem’s chorus of inner voices have been tuned to a
    Nisibene register rather than an Edessene one. Until modern
    readers try to read Ephrem primarily as a Nisibene author, they
    will have failed to approach him on his own ground, I
    believe.<ref target="#FN6">6</ref>
         </p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P6"/>[6] In order
    for us to begin to read Ephrem this way, we must gather about
    us all we can discover of Nisibis and its character so we can
    try to match what we can see of Ephrem’s native city with
    his concerns and views. However, as soon as one begins to
    attempt this project, an intractable problem arises.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P7"/>[7] One of
    the reasons that modern scholars turn their imaginations so
    readily to Edessa as the backdrop for an early Syriac author is
    that our knowledge of Edessa is, relatively, so far advanced.
    Every student of Syriac must read J. B. Segal’s seminal
    work on the city,<ref target="#FN7">7</ref> but we have a number of very useful works
    besides this one that serve to make the student’s eye
    turn to Edessa whenever early Syriac Christianity is under
    consideration.<ref target="#FN8">8</ref> Since we all read Syriac works with information
    about Edessa in our heads, we naturally see connections with
    Edessa in the works of Ephrem. It is not illegitimate to look
    for these, of course, but do we see them because they are, in
    truth, connections with Edessa or do we see them because they
    are connections with the Late Antique Near East? How many of
    the elements that seem “Edessene” in Ephrem’s
    works really are so and how many are ambiguous? If we knew more
    about Nisibis, we might set our knowledge of the two cities
    side by side and see which of the two seems the more likely
    source for Ephrem’s thoughts, but we know little of
    Nisibis and the comparison could hardly be made on equal terms.
    In this paper, I try to begin to redress that balance.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P8"/>[8] It is
    important to realize, at the outset, that it is not possible to
    produce a treatment of Nisibis with anything like the same
    sophistication and detail that our knowledge of Edessa has
    achieved. Edessa has been investigated systematically on the
    ground and Nisibis is, as yet, essentially untouched by modern
    archaeology.<ref target="#FN9">9</ref> The maps of Nisibis I have been able to discover
    and examine<ref target="#FN10">10</ref> are of too large a scale to be useful for
    someone wanting to gain a sense of the site, and reflect the
    military focus of the interests of all their modern creators.
    The most basic tools are lacking for study of Nisibis.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P9"/>[9] This
    lack explains my approach in this paper. Rather than
    synthesizing the information I have been able to collect down
    to a smooth and organized summary, I have, instead, decided to
    try to present, stated systematically by topic and category, as
    much of what I have found as possible. As our knowledge of
    Nisibis grows, I expect that others will be able to make more
    intelligent use of this information than I can, now, at the
    start of the process. I imagine this paper’s usefulness
    to lie in its containing as many items as possible, so that a
    reader can refer to it to check if a detail he has identified
    in a writing, describing the physical situation of the city,
    the name of a bishop, the mix of ethnic groups in the
    population, for example, might refer to Nisibis. I hope that
    someone reading something from Ephrem’s pen might be able
    to refer to this compendium to see if other sources I have
    discovered could shed light on what he is reading. The
    organization of the material into categories will, I hope, make
    it easier to locate the particular material sought. I hope that
    the manner of presentation of this paper has not made it more
    awkward to read than necessary, but I have tried very hard to
    aim at completeness rather than polish. We are too close to the
    beginning of this process to trim off what may seem extraneous
    to us, now. We do not know enough to know what will be
    extraneous and what will be useful. A high polish is not always
    the effect at which historical work should aim, however much I
    admire it in its place. The reader will notice, also, that I
    have posed a number of questions in this paper that I cannot
    answer. These are intended to highlight both possible lines of
    thought and our present lack of certainty.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P10"/>[10] A
    useful way to look at our knowledge of Nisibis before and
    during Ephrem’s life may be to think of a complete,
    well-rounded view of the city as being a mosaic, while what
    survives for us are merely a small number of the tesserae.
    While we do not have enough of the original to reconstruct it
    fully, or even to get a sense of the whole design, by careful
    consideration and comparison of the pieces we do have, we may
    be able to discern some things that the pieces, examined
    individually, would not show us. We may be able to get a better
    sense of the probabilities of different views of the original.
    We may, cautiously, make some observations about the absence of
    elements we would have expected to find, though this is
    perilous and must always be approached with great caution. A
    systematic examination of all the facts we can collect about
    Nisibis may allow us to understand something more of the broad
    background of life in Late Antique Mesopotamia. Keeping these
    facts in the backs of our minds may help us to draw Ephrem, in
    our imagination, back from Edessa to Nisibis and think of him
    more nearly as he was likely to have considered himself: not as
    “the deacon of Edessa”, but as the Nisibene
    refugee.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P11"/>[11] I am
    grateful to the scholars, unknown to me, who served as readers
    for this paper for <hi rend="italic">Hugoye</hi>. I have benefited from their
    suggestions and been led to new sources by them that I did not
    know. In one regard, however, I think it necessary to part
    company with them. They seemed to think that I should take more
    notice of what is generally known of Mesopotamia in Late
    Antiquity, especially of the neighboring areas. In other words,
    they seemed to suggest that I place Nisibis more explicitly
    against the backdrop of what is broadly known of the region. I
    have decided not to follow this suggestion and would like to
    explain why. Since we know so little of Nisibis itself and
    since our knowledge of all of the ancient Near East is
    extremely spotty, and so much formed by the particular
    preoccupations of the archaeologists involved, as Ball<ref target="#FN11">11</ref> makes
    clear in his discussion of the interpretation of the remains of
    a particular area:</p>
         <quote>
      Thus the [perceived] pattern of rural settlement and
      development is affected not so much by the actual remains but
      by archaeological fashion. We have already observed ... how
      academic priorities can distort the received view of urban
      continuity. The rural surveys, in concentrating too
      exclusively on specific research interests, have resulted in
      the true picture being distorted.
    </quote>
         <p>We cannot proceed as if we had a complete or representative
    body of information at our disposal. Whatever we might gather
    about Nisibis in particular would soon be submerged by the
    comparative flood of facts and artifacts relating to other
    cities and sites. Any hope of beginning to gain an idea of
    Nisibis’ own individual character would not survive the
    flattening effect of having the vast majority of information
    stem from elsewhere. In composing this piece I have, to a large
    degree, taken for granted the reader’s acquaintance with
    the broad outline of the political and cultural history of the
    Roman Near East and have tried to focus my gaze solely on
    Nisibis in the hope of beginning to gain a sense of its
    peculiar characteristics. I am willing to accept a spotty and
    incomplete result because I think that is a fair and
    responsible rendering of the state of our knowledge of Nisibis
    at present, given its predominantly literary basis. Until
    modern archaeological work can be performed at the site and the
    materials uncovered have been analyzed by scholars, I do not
    think that we can expand the boundaries of our detailed picture
    very much. I think this paper is useful and I think its
    contents are helpful to the reader of Ephrem, but I do not
    think that it marks the completion of this necessary task.
    Rather than making this paper more rounded and attractive by
    filling in its gaps with information from other locales, I have
    chosen to leave its incompleteness obvious to the
    reader’s eye, both as a salutary reminder of the state of
    our knowledge and as a spur to undertaking first-hand
    investigation on the ground, when that again becomes
    possible.</p>
         <head xml:id="HV8N2Russell3">Physical Situation</head>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P12"/>[12] We
    should begin with the consideration of the physical situation
    of the city of Nisibis. Nisibis sat, and sits, on the southern
    edge of the high ground above the bend of the Mesopotamian
    plain. It stands as a fortress on the edge of a natural wall
    that is the mountain range, or range of high hills, that
    stretch across the northern edge of the center of the curve of
    the Fertile Crescent. If Pigulevskaja’s suggestion that
    the Greek name for the region or valley in which Nisibis lies,
    “Mygdonia”, comes from the Syriac word
    <hi rend="italic">magda’</hi> = ‘fruit’ is correct,<ref target="#FN12">12</ref> that
    would give us good reason to think that the area seemed much
    more fertile than the general run of farm land in that part of
    the world. It might also explain why a city had been built
    at that particular place to control that important
    region. It was always important to have steady food
    supplies near at hand if an ancient city were to
    survive.<ref target="#FN13">13</ref>
         </p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P13"/>[13]
    Nisibis stood astride important routes both from the east to
    west, that is, from Arbela or Seleucia-Ctesiphon to Edessa or
    Harran, and from the north the south, that is, from Armenia to
    the Mesopotamian plain. This position, it is important to
    remember, determined not only the city’s importance in
    war, but also its importance in trade.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P14"/>[14]
    Nisibis stood by the side of a river, the Mygdonius (whose name
    echoes that of the area), which flows into the upper
    Euphrates.<ref target="#FN14">14</ref> It was also so close to the Tigris to the
    east, and so highly elevated above the flatter land in that
    direction, that Ammianus Marcellinus reports having been able
    to see from Nisibis fires burning to the east as evidence of
    the Persian incursion across the river in 359.<ref target="#FN15">15</ref>
         </p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P15"/>[15] This
    position, both of natural and strategic importance, meant that
    the city was of great military value to whatever political
    state controlled it. Thus we hear from Dio Cassius:<ref target="#FN16">16</ref>
         </p>
         <quote>
      Lucullus reached this city in the summer time, and although
      he directed his attacks upon it in no half-hearted fashion,
      he effected nothing. For the walls, being of brick, double,
      and of great thickness, with a deep moat intervening, could
      be neither battered down anywhere, nor undermined ...
    </quote>
         <p>The fortifications that greeted the Romans’ on their
    arrival on the scene show that the need to protect the city as
    a precious asset already had a long history. Such
    formidable defenses were not the product of a brief building
    spree or one ruler’s whim, but were evidence of
    long-standing, serious concern for the site’s
    protection. The city had a very long history due to its
    natural desirability. This explains its having been
    continuously occupied for as far back in time as we can trace
    the history of the region.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P16"/>[16]
    Along with the city’s antiquity, we should be aware of
    its individuality. It is important to remember the strongly
    localized quality of life in the ancient world. Indeed, we
    should remember the localized quality of life in all ages
    before our own, if we consider our own age to begin in the
    middle of the 19<hi rend="sup">th</hi> century with the wide
    distribution of steam-powered travel both on land and on sea.
    It has been well said:<ref target="#FN17">17</ref>
         </p>
         <quote>
      ... we need to remind ourselves just how diverse and
      disparate the communities of the fourth century—and not
      just the Christian communities—were. The basic unit was
      the city—<hi rend="italic">polis</hi>, <hi rend="italic">civitas</hi>—with
      its surrounding countryside. Except in the case of a few
      great cities, especially Rome and Constantinople, the city
      and its surroundings were a self-contained economic unit.
      They were also self-governing, governed by local notables ...
      The Roman Empire made no attempt to erase this prevailing
      sense of locality.
    </quote>
         <p>

    seems clear that the Greek population of Nisibis grew
    progressively as the time of Hellenistic occupation continued,
    which was the normal thing in Near Eastern cities. It also
    seems that, in comparison to other cities of the Hellenistic
    occupation, Nisibis was very little Hellenized and that the
    Syrians in it remained much the most important part of the
    population. It was, of course, given, officially, the name of
    ‘Antioch in Mygdonia’,<ref target="#FN21">21</ref> but the use of the old name
    seems to have returned with the fall of the Seleucids and we
    should expect that the traditional name was commonly used by
    the Syrian population throughout the Hellenistic period. Jones
    attributes at least part of the lack of permanent Hellenistic
    influence on the local populace to its “chequered
    history” (a very reasonable suggestion) and cites the
    continuation of brother/sister marriages as an example of the
    cultural orientalism that survived even to the time of
    Justinian and Justin II.<ref target="#FN22">22</ref> Jacob Neusner, speaking more

      Because of its antiquity and changing fortunes, the region
      was, by the second century BCE, a mosaic of peoples,
      languages and cultures. In addition to Jews, who had been
      exiled there in the sixth century BCE, and remained in large
      numbers, the Babylonian region contained numerous
      Babylonians, who spoke Aramaic and also (through their
      priests) preserved Akkadian; Macedonians and Greeks; Syrians,
      Arabs, and other Semites; Armenians and Iranians; and
      occasional Indians and Chinese. Many of the cities had
      largely Hellenized populations, particularly Seleucia,
      Charax-Spasinu and Artemita; others, particularly Babylon and
      Uruk, were centers of the ancient Babylonian cuneiform
      civilization; while still others, particularly Ctesiphon,
      were populated by great numbers of Parthian government
      officials, troops and traders. Yet few cities were inhabited
      by a single ethnic or religious group, and all exhibited a
      measure of Hellenistic culture; Susa, far to the east,
      conducted its municipal affairs according to accepted
      Seleucid forms and in the Greek language long into the
      Parthian period, while Babylonians, Syrians, Jews, and Greeks
      mingled in the streets of Seleucia. We know, moreover,
      that the Greek and native Babylonian elements were intimately
      intertwined.

    Another note of caution would not come amiss at this
    point. While we may know that different languages were in
    use in the same place at the same time, this does not
    necessarily tell us who the people were who were using
    them. When we have epigraphic evidence we do have
    something solid to hold on to, but it is important to realize
    that this evidence is of strictly limited value. It is too easy
    to think that we know who would have been using which languages
    in certain locations at certain times, but our knowledge is
    rarely dependable in that regard. Despite the fact that
    all scholars seem to agree that the Christian community in
    Nisibis was less Hellenized than that in Edessa (perhaps
    because it lies farther to the east), we must remember that the
    earliest Christian inscription from Nisibis, found in the
    baptistery of the church building there, was put up by Bp.
    Vologeses in Greek, not in Syriac. Of course, this might
    have been analogous to the common custom in American Episcopal
    churches of putting inscriptions inside their buildings in
    Latin (or even Greek!) despite the fact that no one, including
    the priest and the stone carver, is able to read these when
    they are completed. Christians of earlier times were not
    necessarily more innocent of cultural, social and theological
    pretensions than their modern brethren. In other words, that
    inscription may tell us something about the ethnic make-up of
    the Christian community in Nisibis at that time, or it may not,
    and there seems to be no certain way to determine which of
    these is the appropriate conclusion to draw.<ref target="#FN24">24</ref>
         </p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P21"/>[21] Bp.
    Vologeses, himself, is an interesting person to
    consider. While bishop of the Christian community in a
    city that seems to have been mostly Syriac-speaking, he put up
    an inscription in the new showplace of his church
    (commemorating his having had a hand in building it, no less),
    but he did so in Greek! “Vologeses”, by the
    way, is not a Greek or Syriac name, itself, but rather one of
    Parthian extraction, and would have been associated with the
    Roman Empire’s rival to the east in the minds of the
    Christians of Nisibis.<ref target="#FN25">25</ref> (Vologeses IV of Parthia besieged
    Nisibis in 197.<ref target="#FN26">26</ref>) I think it is a sign of a certain
    open-mindedness on the part of the Christian community that
    Bishop Vologeses’ family (if he was born in Nisibis) did
    not feel social pressure to give him a more
    ‘Christian’ name. It seems that, whatever language
    Vologeses himself spoke as his “native tongue”, it
    could not have been both the same as that in which his people
    worshipped (Syriac) and that in which the inscription was
    composed (Greek). Was it neither of these, but rather
    Armenian or Persian? It is hard to imagine a family without
    roots to the north or east choosing such a name for their
    son.<ref target="#FN27">27</ref> Clearly, the Christian community, itself, knew
    more variety in background among its members than we can
    discover at this point.</p>

         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P22"/>[22] The
    mix of religions present in Nisibis during and before the life
    of Ephrem cannot be reconstructed in detail. We can, however,
    rehearse some of the facts that we do know and then try to
    assess what they tell us about what Ephrem’s religious
    environment would have seemed like to him.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P23"/>[23] As
    far as paganism is concerned, while we know for certain that it
    must have been present, we know really very little about which
    cults were represented in Nisibis. Ephrem himself, in the
    10<hi rend="sup">th</hi> and 11<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of his <hi rend="italic">Hymns on
    Nicomedia</hi>, makes specific reference to the use of
    astrology and incantations among the people in Nisibis.<ref target="#FN28">28</ref> There
    is evidence also, of the survival of local non-Hellenic cults
    into this period.<ref target="#FN29">29</ref> It seems that there is good reason to
    conclude that traditional Semitic paganism (that is, cults
    addressed to some of the many local deities common in the Near
    East before the conquests of Alexander, such as Hadad, Bel and
    Shamash) continued on throughout the Hellenic period into late
    antiquity, but we know virtually nothing about it in detail.
    Millar is quite correct in commenting “…we have no
    way of knowing what myths or beliefs attached to these
    cults”.<ref target="#FN30">30</ref> It seems certain, judging by literary evidence
    and by the archaeological work carried out elsewhere in what
    was once the Seleucid domain, that there would have been local,
    quite un-Hellenized cults, some Hellenic imports (likely poorer
    and less well attended after the arrival of Roman rule under
    the early Empire) and some cults that included elements from
    both backgrounds. Even this general picture, however, takes us
    beyond our fact-based knowledge and should not be pressed. The
    lack of modern archaeological work in the area and the lack of
    Syriac pagan writings leave us dependent for information on
    passing references in Jewish and Christian works. (Islamic
    works are too late to be considered contemporary sources, and,
    so, offer further difficulties, if one tries to use them with
    this in mind. I have avoided them for this reason.) It is one
    of the difficulties inherent in the sort of written materials
    that survive from the period that their Christian or Jewish
    nature means that the lives and practices of pagan people are
    almost completely neglected. For example, Stoneman<ref target="#FN31">31</ref> says
    that the cult of the Roman emperor is absent in Syria, but I
    would prefer to say that we have not yet found evidence of it
    and so may assume that it was not common. I do not think that
    our knowledge is extensive enough to enable us to claim that we
    know that something did not exist in this area at all.</p>

    Numismatic evidence, always, in some respects, pleasantly
    specific, shows coins minted by the city with images of
    Caracalla, Macrinus, Gordian III and Tranquillina, Otacilia
    Severa and Philip Junior on the obverses, while the reverses
    show either the Tyche of the city or, on that of Otacilia
    Severa, a temple of the Tyche with the Tyche seated between its
    pillars.<ref target="#FN32">32</ref> This last shows a sign of the
    constellation Aries, a detail included on some of the others.
    Otacilia Severa is also shown with a river god swimming at her
    feet. The Tyche is so general a symbol that it says nothing
    about Nisibis in particular. The constellation may be a
    reflection of the same interest Ephrem describes in <hi rend="italic">Hymns
    on Nicomedia</hi> 10 + 11. Hill displays Nisibene coins showing
    Macrinus, Severus Alexander, Severus Alexander with Julia
    Mamaea, Julia Mamaea, Gordian III, Gordian III and
    Tranquillina, Tranquillina, Philip Senior and Otacilia
    Severa.<ref target="#FN33">33</ref> This slightly different group of coins shows
    almost exactly the same range of decoration as those in the
    Hunterian collection. I think it makes sense to conclude that
    this array of images reflects the interests and
    self-understanding of the city rather than of the imperial
    figures who caused the coins to be struck. All of these symbols
    fit easily into the life of the city and its cultural
    interests, as we know them. Drijvers<ref target="#FN34">34</ref> warns that we
    should take notice of the cult of a city’s Tyche and of
    astrology. He considers these to have been lively rivals to the
    growth of Christianity and helpful gauges of a city’s
    cultural profile and its cultural change over time.</p>

            <anchor corresp="P25"/>[25] We
    do know, on the other hand, quite a bit more about Judaism in

    that Nisibis was an important place in the Jewish
    <hi rend="italic">Diaspora</hi> to the east of Palestine.<ref target="#FN35">35</ref> We know that the
    Jews in Nisibis were not cut off from their brethren in the
    homeland, but rather supported them with funds when the times
    demanded. Moreover, it is clear that the feeling of having an
    active attachment went in both directions. A good example of
    this is the flight of the students of Rabbi Akiba who went to
    Nisibis to stay with Rabbi Judah ben Bathyra during the Bar
    Kokba war.<ref target="#FN36">36</ref>

    Neusner takes very seriously the prominence of Judaism in
    Nisibis and credits the presence of Tannaitic<ref target="#FN37">37</ref> teachers there
    as a reason for the slow growth of Christianity in Nisibis,
    especially as compared to the growth of the church in Edessa,
    which did not have that Tannaitic presence.<ref target="#FN38">38</ref> If this
    suggestion is correct, it may provide a useful handle for the
    modern student of Ephrem to grasp when considering both
    Ephrem’s method of approach to understanding Scripture
    and his rhetorical customs when interacting with Judaism. It
    may also shed some light on the social and ethnic profile of
    the church in Nisibis. It would be wrong to think that the
    Christians were limited to people of Jewish extraction, but
    suggesting that a relatively large portion of the Christians
    (relative, that is, to the size of the whole group) had Jewish
    forbears seems quite reasonable. Consider the following passage
    in which Neusner reflects on the competing penetrations of the
    rival religious groups (Tannaitic Judaism and Christianity)
    into the Jewish population in Mesopotamia.<ref target="#FN39">39</ref>
         </p>
         <quote>
      How shall we understand these facts? They indicate the
      penetration of an undifferentiated Jewish population by
      rival, organized parties at pretty much the same time. To say
      that one or another group ‘failed to make
      headway’ is probably misleading. What must have
      happened is that where Pharisaism established itself, it shut
      out Christianity, just as Christianity excluded Pharisaism if
      it preceded the arrival of a rabbinical school. The two
      parties, Pharisaism and Christianity, shaped the pre-existing
      “Judaism” to suit their respective purposes.

    Manichaeism was also a religious force in this part of the

    have been a follower of Shapur’s army on its invasion
    into the Roman territory,<ref target="#FN42">42</ref> and it seems clear that, by the
    time of his death in 276, his followers and their religion had
    already entered into Roman territory. This spread seems to have
    followed the routes of trade, as religions usually did.<ref target="#FN43">43</ref> It is clear that Ephrem was very
    interested in Manichaeism. He wrote against it in his <hi rend="italic">Prose
    Refutations of Mani, Marcion and bar Daisan</hi> and showed
    some degree of knowledge about its content of teaching and
    religious practice.<ref target="#FN44">44</ref> Jason David BeDuhn<ref target="#FN45">45</ref> refers to the
    following sentence of Ephrem from the edition of Mitchell,
    I.cxix. His understanding of its meaning emphasizes
    Ephrem’s knowledge of his theological opponents.</p>
         <quote>
      “For their works are like our works as their fast is
      like our fast, but their faith is not like our faith.”
      Of course, Ephrem cannot allow this observation to stand
      alone, but draws appropriate polemical conclusions:
      “And, therefore, rather than being known by the fruit
      of their works they are distinguished by the fruit of their
      words. For their work is able to lead astray and (yet)
      appear as fine, for its bitterness is invisible; but their
      words cannot lead astray, for their blasphemies are
      evident”.
    </quote>
         <p>This ability to distinguish between the varying divergence
    between Manichaeism and Christianity in the areas of practice
    and doctrine is surely evidence of enough acquaintance with the
    Church’s competitor to allow Ephrem to engage it on more
    than one level. It makes sense to think that Ephrem had
    had some contact with Manichaeans himself, whether they were
    travelers through Nisibis or permanent residents of the
    city. His knowledge of their actions has the air of being
    first-hand, to my ear. John C. Reeves’ compilation of
    citations of Manichaean writings he has drawn from
    Ephrem’s <hi rend="italic">Prose Refutations</hi> 
            <ref target="#FN46">46</ref> supports this
    conclusion in detail. Ephrem seems either to have had access to
    Manichaean writings himself or to have had prolonged close
    contact with well-instructed Manichaeans and have heard their
    teaching and argumentation. The relevance of this to his life
    in Nisibis is still in question, however.</p>

    willingness to share a burial ground with another religious
    group should be taken as evidence of close familiarity, though
    not necessarily approval. That close familiarity makes the kind
    of contact Ephrem seems to have had with Manichaeism seem
    plausible. Our evidence does not allow us to be more specific
    than that, as yet.</p>

    There must have been other religious groups present in the city
    of Nisibis, also. For example, because the city was an official
    center of trade between the Persian Empire and the Roman Empire
    and was one of the designated pass-through points for travelers
    moving from one territory to the other, there must have been
    Zoroastrians in Nisibis on a regular basis. I have been able to
    find no reference to any Zoroastrian organization or cultic
    center in the city, but their presence must have been a usual
    thing.<ref target="#FN48">48</ref> Cumont<ref target="#FN49">49</ref> speaks of temples at “Zela
    in Pontus and Hierocaesarea in Lydia” but offers no
    details. De Jong<ref target="#FN50">50</ref> mentions sanctuaries of Anahita in Lydia.
    Boyce and Grenet<ref target="#FN51">51</ref> speak of evidence of worship of Ahura
    Mazda in northern Syria and Antioch in the Third Century. James
    R. Russell<ref target="#FN52">52</ref> gives evidence for the survival of
    Zoroastrianism in Armenia into the 20<hi rend="sup">th</hi> century,
    which shows how completely its roots could take hold in an area
    outside the Persian heartland. All this agreement lends weight
    to our logical conclusions, but the continuing lack of
    specific, concrete evidence of cultic activity in Nisibis

    particularly under Shapur II (309-379), despite the fact that

    Anahita,”<ref target="#FN57">57</ref> Anahita being a goddess associated by
    Zoroastrians with water, an important sacred element. What

    less clear in Late Antiquity than we, in the modern West, think
    it should be. It seems safe to say that Christians living in
    Roman territory on the boundaries of the Persian Empire would
    have felt threatened by Persian power, as such, and were

    should themselves have destroyed them.” This word,
    <hi rend="italic">hbwšt’</hi>, seems to have an overtone of
    people being shut up together. It later comes to be used
    for things like monastic cells. It puts me in mind here,
    though, of the “conventicles” of Dissenters during
    the aftermath of the English Reformation. That is, it
    seems to be a word that is used of groups that seem, to the
    speaker, to be a bit shady, but it doesn’t carry any
    particular identifying content of its own. Gnostic groups
    would be an easy fit with it, but so would any groups that
    Ephrem might not approve of. It seems impossible to tell
    if he has in mind Christian groups he doesn’t like or
    other sorts of questionable characters. We should refuse
    to come to a conclusion when our evidence does not lead us to
    do so. Thus, this passage can serve as evidence of a number of
    religious groups meeting in Nisibis of whom Ephrem did not
    approve, but I do not think we know enough to be certain that
    they described themselves as Christian and, if they did, what
    form of Christianity they practiced. We could have guessed at
    their presence, but we still cannot guess at their
    identity.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P36"/>[36] It
    makes sense to assume that business and war brought all sorts
    of people to Nisibis. It makes sense to assume that Ephrem grew
    up and lived almost his whole life in a city in which all sorts
    of religious practices and religious groups were present, at
    least as they passed through from east to west, north to south,
    or vice versa. Exactly which groups were present, however, we
    cannot discover from the materials we have at hand. While this
    may help us understand his great interest in arguing with, and
    against, religious thought of all kinds, the details of our
    knowledge do not allow us to sort the works of Ephrem that
    survive into Nisibene and Edessene groups based on the rival
    religious groups and figures that are mentioned, because, even
    when we know a group was present in Edessa, we are not able to
    say that it was not also present in Nisibis.</p>

            <anchor corresp="P37"/>[37] It
    is certainly clear that a variety of cultural influences was at

    each was most particularly active, is impossible for us to map.

         <p>It does seem clear, however, that Nisibis was less fully

         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P38"/>[38]
    First, it is possible that the Stoic philosopher Apollophanes
    came from Nisibis.<ref target="#FN66">66</ref> We also know that Greek was used far to
    the east of Nisibis, for example at the Sassanid court, even by
    Shapur II.<ref target="#FN67">67</ref> We should remember that the earliest Christian
    inscription in Nisibis, that found in the baptistery built by
    Bishop Vologeses, was written in Greek. The study of
    architecture also reveals to us the importance of the Greek
    influence in the region of Nisibis, even long after
    Ephrem’s life was over and the region had fallen under
    Persian rule, never to be Roman again.<ref target="#FN68">68</ref> It is an
    important point to note that there is evidence for Hellenistic
    influence to be found in rural areas as well as inside the city
    walls.<ref target="#FN69">69</ref> This, of course, argues for a much fuller
    degree of cultural penetration than the presence of evidence
    only in urban sites would demand.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P39"/>[39] I
    must digress here to consider and respond to an article of
    Fergus Millar that has just been pointed out to me.<ref target="#FN70">70</ref> The
    issues it treats are relevant to many of the sections of this
    paper, but I have chosen to address them here because Millar
    uses the language of the baptistery inscription at Nisibis as
    his focal point in addressing Nisibis and because his paper is,
    itself, directed at the intersection between ethnic identity,
    culture and religion, which seems to fit in best at this point
    in our progress.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P40"/>[40]
    Millar depicts the Church in the Roman Near East as being a
    primarily Greek speaking entity during the life of
    Ephrem.<ref target="#FN71">71</ref> He makes note of the fact that epigraphic
    evidence of Christian inscriptions in Syriac has them appearing
    first in Mesopotamia and only later coming into the lands west
    of the Euphrates.<ref target="#FN72">72</ref> This seems to lead him to think that the
    appearance of the Syriac language in inscriptions was a process
    of something new moving into a previously all Greek context, at
    least as far as public Christian usage was concerned. This is a
    very different basic picture than the one that has undergirded
    this study and I would like to take issue with it.</p>

    Millar, as I read him, takes the Greek language inscription in
    the baptistery at Nisibis and Egeria’s report of the dual
    language liturgy at Aelia Capitolina (Jerusalem) as two of his
    central founding facts.<ref target="#FN73">73</ref> Millar says:</p>
         <quote>
      The liturgy, in Aelia at least (we have no evidence for
      elsewhere), allowed for repetition in ‘the Syrian
      language’ of the bishop’s words uttered in Greek.
    </quote>
         <p>That introduces one point I would like to address.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P42"/>[42] The
    second point may be found earlier on the same page when he
    speaks of Nisibis directly:</p>
         <quote>
      Nisibis, by contrast, was a significant city, and was also
      the birthplace, and the original place of residence, of
      Ephraim, the greatest of Christian writers in Syriac. But,
      none the less, the earliest Christian inscription from there,
      recording the construction of the baptistery (which is still
      standing) by bishop Vologeses in 359/360, is again in Greek.
      Only a decade later, Nisibis was to be lost to the Persians.
      But the churches of the central and western part of
      Mesopotamia, and of Osrhoene, areas which remained Roman,
      continued to use Greek as their official language.
    </quote>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P43"/>[43] This
    concluding thought seems to reappear on the next page when
    Millar says:</p>
         <quote>
      If the surviving pagan cults of the Near East did not find
      any written expression in languages other than Greek, and if
      ‘the Syrian language’ can be seen as only slowly
      acquiring a public role within the Greek-speaking Church,
      that does not mean that major issues were not associated with
      the interplay of ethnicity, language, and religion.
    </quote>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P44"/>[44] His
    second point lies, I think, in the overlap between what he
    means by “official language” in the first quotation
    and “public role” in the second. I would like to
    take the question of the evidence for liturgical language use
    first.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P45"/>[45] In
    the strict sense, in the mold of Egeria’s eye-witness
    description of the liturgical practice at Aelia Capitolina, I
    agree that we have no witness (to my knowledge) of the
    liturgies of the Late Antique Roman East during Ephrem’s
    lifetime. One of the things that bedevils students of Ephrem is
    that we have no concrete place to put our feet when we try to
    imagine how he worshipped and how his work was used until the
    homily of Jacob of Serug celebrating him in the late Fifth or
    early Sixth Century.<ref target="#FN74">74</ref> Still, it is the universal opinion of
    students of Syriac (as far as I know) that the great majority
    of Ephrem’s surviving works were produced and intended
    for liturgical use. I have never heard a hint of the idea that
    the liturgy in which they were included might have been
    primarily conducted in Greek. Generally, since the time of
    Jacob, Ephrem has been spoken of as someone who was addressing
    the average worshipper in the congregation, with the assumption
    that he, and they, were all part of one Syriac-speaking
    Christian body. The language of Ephrem’s work itself, and
    the large size of the <hi rend="italic">corpus</hi> that survives, are
    commonly taken as concrete evidence of the language of his
    original milieu and of his work being incorporated into that
    tradition almost immediately, thus surviving for us to read. I
    see no reason to doubt that general picture. Millar does not
    argue against this view, but his paper seems to assume
    something very different. I do not think that the evidence from
    Aelia Capitolina (a special case, in Christian terms, if ever
    there was one) can properly be applied to Nisibis as an aid to
    interpretation. I have argued elsewhere in this paper<ref target="#FN75">75</ref> for
    the individuality and particularity of ancient city life and
    think that the principle holds good in this case. Let me move
    to the next point, for now.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P46"/>[46] The
    question of a language being the “official” one of
    an early Christian community and its having “a public
    role” in the community life is one I would like to
    address. I admit that these are deep waters and, as Egeria
    reminds us of Aelia Capitolina, more than one language could be
    used at the same time in the same community for the same
    liturgical purpose. Still, I do not think that, in Christian
    terms, it makes sense to imagine any language being the
    “official” one of a community, in Late Antiquity,
    except the language used in worship. I expect that there were
    then, as there are now, many places in the Church where more
    than one language was in liturgical use in the same locale. It
    cannot be ruled out as a possibility that a Greek language
    liturgy was held in Nisibis during the life of Ephrem. (It
    would be extremely interesting to know if this were so. It
    would have a great impact on how we imagine his works to have
    begun being translated into Greek, for instance.) However, I do
    not think that the appearance of the baptistery inscription is
    sufficient warrant for us to conclude that Greek was the
    “official” language of the city’s Christian
    community. That Greek had “a public role” (as well
    as Syriac) in Nisibene Christianity I take as established fact:
    the one because of the inscription and the other because of
    Ephrem’s own works, but that Greek in any way
    predominated in community use in Nisibis during Ephrem’s
    life seems extremely unlikely to me. How could this have been
    so and have left us with no hint of its presence in all of
    Ephrem’s writings? More evidence is surely required
    before we over-turn the settled picture of language use in
    Nisibis.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P47"/>[47]
    Despite the fact that I have already tried to make this point
    above,<ref target="#FN76">76</ref> M. C. A. Macdonald’s article<ref target="#FN77">77</ref> on
    what language use, as evidenced in epigraphy, can actually tell
    us about the ethnic identity of ancient people is so apt for
    this point that I cannot proceed without discussing it.<ref target="#FN78">78</ref>
         </p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P48"/>[48]
    Macdonald describes throughout his paper the uncertainties
    inherent in making use of the language or script used in
    inscriptions to try to sort the writers (or patrons paying for
    the carving) into groups by background and culture. He makes
    some very useful distinctions among different sorts of
    inscriptions as a part of this reflection and has this to say
    about inscriptions created for public display, among which we
    must group the baptistery inscription of Vologeses in
    Nisibis.<ref target="#FN79">79</ref>
         </p>
         <quote>
      Formal, monumental inscriptions, carved by a professional
      mason, usually tell us little about the language(s)
      habitually used by the titular ‘author’ of the
      text. They are for public consumption and many different
      factors will have governed the choice of the language or
      languages in which they are couched. Among these, prestige
      must always have been an important consideration. How many
      village churches in the depths of the English countryside
      contain monuments to dead squires in Latin, a language which
      none of the congregation could read and which the squire
      himself had probably long since forgotten? Similarly, it is
      dangerous to assume from the wealth of Greek formal
      inscriptions throughout Syria that the population in general
      spoke (let alone, read) Greek, rather than (or, even, as well
      as) Aramaic or another Semitic language. ... it is essential
      to look at each inscription within its context and part of
      that context is the interplay of written and spoken
      languages, and of degrees, and different types of
      literacy.”

         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P49"/>[49] This
    brief passage expresses my own thoughts about the Nisibene
    inscription very exactly. Since we know (or think we do) that
    the Christian community in Nisibis worshipped in Syriac during
    Ephrem’s lifetime, and since we are confronted with this
    public, ornamental inscription in the baptistery in Greek, does
    it not seem more reasonable to conclude that there is some
    other explanation for the language of the inscription than that
    the Nisibene Christian community actually functioned in Greek?
    Let us look at one possibility that arises immediately for
    consideration.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P50"/>[50]
    Sidney Griffith has written eloquently about Ephrem’s
    deep attachment to the greater Christian Church that lay mostly
    to the west of Nisibis.<ref target="#FN80">80</ref> Might it not be possible that
    that feeling of attachment was not unique to Ephrem in his time
    and place but that many in the community also thought of
    themselves as being deeply attached, as Christians, to the
    Christian Roman Empire? With the Persian Empire on their
    door-step more and more hostile to Christianity, this does not
    seem an unreasonable thing to suggest. If so, might not the
    choice of language for the baptistery inscription be a further
    manifestation of that desire of the community to cling to their
    western brethren rather than a sign of their liturgical or
    “official” language? This cannot be certainly
    known, but it seems more likely to me than the conclusion that
    Ephrem spent six decades in a Greek language Christian
    community while writing a whole library of Syriac Christian
    liturgical pieces. 400 hymns and 30 verse homilies<ref target="#FN81">81</ref> seems
    like a lot to have produced if only the last decade of his life
    was spent in a Syriac language community. Who would have been
    the intended audience for the <hi rend="italic">Nisibene Hymns</hi>, in that
    picture? I think we are better off thinking a more Syrian
    picture of the Christian community in Nisibis was the most
    likely.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P51"/>[51] In
    the end, the concrete evidence Millar discusses makes clear
    that we have very little evidence at all to apply to this
    question of cultural and linguistic distribution in the Late
    Antique Near East. I think that we should, in that case, resist
    the temptation to generalize from what we have and make note of
    our particular facts. I would want to resist overturning what
    our extensive literary remains seem to indicate on the strength
    of a single inscription, as concrete as that may be. It is
    important not to allow one’s imagination to be so
    inhibited by the lack of physical evidence (as yet discovered)
    that one finds oneself led to a conclusion that instinct would
    otherwise avoid.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P52"/>[52]
    There are, of course, many facts that point to the activity of
    the Semitic, Aramaic, influence on Nisibis and its region. The
    first, and most obvious, of these must be the dropping out of
    use of the Greek name for the city, ‘Antioch in
    Mygdonia’, and the large number of variants in spelling
    and pronunciation of the native name of the city, Nisibis. Both
    of these serve to show the strength of the native tradition
    about the city’s identity. The breadth of usage of the
    traditional name is shown in the variant spellings and the
    weakness of the official attempt to change its name to one that
    would serve the government’s greater glory makes the
    number of locals firmly attached to the government seem
    small.<ref target="#FN82">82</ref>
         </p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P53"/>[53] The
    exact nature of the culture passed down by those living in
    Mesopotamia in an Aramaic-speaking milieu is very difficult for
    us to gauge. Almost all the information we have about this
    Aramaic cultural stream comes to us through a Jewish filter.
    While we know that there were many non-Jewish Aramaic speakers,
    we have very little writing that they produced surviving for us
    to read.<ref target="#FN83">83</ref>
         </p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P54"/>[54] Our
    acceptance of the vibrancy of the Aramaic culture is made
    stronger by the fact that no record of Greek games, whether
    athletic or literary, survives from east of the Euphrates
    River.<ref target="#FN84">84</ref> Anyone who is familiar with the importance the
    Greeks attached to these games, especially, perhaps, those on
    the margins of Greek culture trying to identify themselves with
    it,<ref target="#FN85">85</ref> will realize that an area that produced no
    games was, in a very real sense, producing no Greeks. Palmyra,
    for example, seems to have had no gymnasium, baths or
    amphitheater.<ref target="#FN86">86</ref> It is interesting to note, by the way, that
    Dio Cassius, when describing the inhabitants of Nisibis about
    the time that Lucullus captured the city in 68 BC, calls them
    <hi rend="italic">barbaroi</hi>, the surest and clearest way of indicating
    that he did not consider them to be Greeks.<ref target="#FN87">87</ref>
         </p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P55"/>[55] It
    is important for us to remember that most of our evidence from
    the Near East comes from the areas that were under the greatest
    Hellenistic influence. The highly literate nature of the
    culture the Greeks produced and inspired sparked the production
    of a great mass of written evidence, literary and epigraphic,
    that may well exaggerate the size of their influence. The study
    of Late Antique Hellenism is a field that enjoys a large body
    of raw material, but the almost complete absence of Aramaic
    language literary remains, Jewish religious writings aside,
    means that Late Antique Aramaic culture is a closed book to
    us. There is no way for us to know what reality this lack
    of evidence indicates. We must match the silence of the
    past with silence of our own. Thus, Millar is moved to
    say,<ref target="#FN88">88</ref>
         </p>
         <quote>
      Above all, the notion that there was a ‘Syrian’
      culture, embracing equally the zone of Syriac literature and
      Roman Syria, goes beyond our evidence.
    </quote>
         <p>Of course, this predicament tells us nothing about the
    existence, or lack of one, of a Syrian culture. It tells us
    only the nature of the evidence that survives for us to

         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P56"/>[56] It
    may well be that we moderns give too much weight to matters of
    language when we consider cultural identity. Especially for us
    North Americans, who tend to think of different languages as
    impermeable walls that separate one group of people from
    another, languages seem to isolate groups of people from each
    other.<ref target="#FN89">89</ref>

    Drijvers,<ref target="#FN90">90</ref> in speaking with reference to Edessa, warns
    his readers not to refine too much on the barriers set up by
    language differences in the Near East of Late Antiquity:</p>
         <quote>
      The border area fostered a continuous exchange of goods and
      ideas, and stood open to influences from all directions. That
      means that the question of language is not decisive: almost
      all writings that originated in that area and date back to
      the first three centuries A.D. are handed down in the Syriac
      <!--<u>-->and<!--</u>--> a Greek version, and it is often very difficult to
      establish which was the original. I would like to add: it is
      not that important either! Whoever was literate in that
      particular time and area usually knew both languages, and it
      may even be supposed that most texts were written down in two
      versions from the very outset. That does not mean that
      writings and ideas stemming from the east Syrian region
      belong without any differentiation to the mainstream of Greek
      Christian literature as we know it from more western areas,
      but their special features are not exclusively due to the
      fact that they were written by chance in Syriac and often
      also transmitted in Greek. Rather, the whole cultural and
      religious situation determined their particular content and
      tendencies, which react on and reflect that situation.

         <p>While we may be suspicious that a scholar who was himself so
    adept at learning languages might have tended to minimize the
    difficulties attendant on all linguistic variety, his point is
    worth consideration. We may be led to over-emphasize the

    strangeness in studying ancient Semitic tongues.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P58"/>[58] It
    is also worth noting, in this regard, a warning that Millar
    puts forward when he is considering the evidence that comes
    down to us about the Late Antique Near East. Millar makes the
    point that much of this evidence is connected to military
    activity. The concerns of the ancient military authors (and, of
    course, those from whom they gathered their information would
    have known this) center very largely on the relationship
    various areas and cities had with the continuation of Roman
    rule. This is natural, considering the role of the Roman army
    in holding on to the fringes of the empire. One of the
    byproducts of this fact is that every city and area, and those
    inhabitants of it who might have come in contact with the Roman
    authors, would have had good reason for emphasizing, even
    over-emphasizing, the attachment they felt toward Rome and the
    cultural connections they enjoyed with the lands farther to the
    West.<ref target="#FN91">91</ref> This means, of course, that we must be very
    careful when we make use of ancient evidence to discover
    cultural affinities between the Mediterranean and these areas.
    Ancient writers, and witnesses, were not striving for the
    dispassionate stance of a modern, scholarly ethnographer.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P59"/>[59] We
    know, of course, that there were other strains of cultural
    influence at work in the area. The presence of Manichaeism in
    the Roman Empire and in the region of Nisibis is, itself, a
    sign of exposure to currents stemming from the interior of the
    Parthian/Persian empire.<ref target="#FN92">92</ref> We might remember, also, that the
    bishop in Nisibis who built the baptistery that survives to
    this day, at least partially, was named Vologeses, which
    clearly points to personal ties leading farther to the
    East.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P60"/>[60] I
    think that Millar’s point about the significance of the
    creation of a Syriac Christian literature as the Church grew
    among Aramaic speakers is a useful one. There certainly must
    have been cultural life in the community already, waiting to be
    harnessed for Christian use, but we cannot see through this
    culture’s Christian production to the pre-existing
    cultural base behind it.<ref target="#FN93">93</ref> Still, it is very unlikely that
    this Syriac Christian literature was a wholly new creation,
    spurred into being by the arrival of the Gospel. Logic and
    cultural probability both urge us to imagine an active Aramaic
    language culture in the pre-Christian period, beyond the bounds
    of the more easily traced Jewish community as well as within
    it.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P61"/>[61] What
    effect on the life of the city would its proximity to the
    imperial border have had? Elton holds that the presence of
    borders tends to increase traffic towards and across them,
    rather than decreasing it.<ref target="#FN94">94</ref> The economic life and settlement
    that was sparked across the top of England by the building of
    Hadrian’s Wall is a good example of this effect at work.
    The effect would, logically, be increased in the area of a
    pass-through point, such as Nisibis. This should give us pause
    in the same way that Drijvers’ point about languages
    should give us pause. Linguistic variety and political
    boundaries may not have separated Mesopotamia from the east as
    much as we would have expected to be the case. Stoneman<ref target="#FN95">95</ref> makes
    the point that Rome’s border defences were insufficient
    to provide a real bulwark against attack and notes, to my
    surprise, that no Persian or Parthian border fortifications
    have been discovered by archaeologists, thus far. This must
    argue strongly against their being necessary for warfare, since
    both those states repeatedly engaged Rome in war. Stoneman
    suggests the possibility that they were intended to manage the
    flow of traffic across the border, which seems reasonable. I
    also wonder if Rome, usually governed by men from other parts
    of its extensive territory, might not have built border forts
    in Mesopotamia because it commonly did so on the other edges of
    its territory, rather than for any particular, locally
    appropriate, purpose. Large governmental organizations often
    choose consistency over practicality through bureaucratic
    inertia. It may be a mistake, again, to think of borders as
    walls rather than, perhaps, as funnels. Procopius, speaking
    about a border area near Armenia, has this to say:<ref target="#FN96">96</ref>
         </p>
         <quote>
      ... the two frontiers were mixed up. The subjects of both the
      Romans and the Persians had no fear of the other and were not
      suspicious of attack, but they intermarried and held joint
      markets and farmed together.
    </quote>
         <p>Possekel reminds us<ref target="#FN97">97</ref> that the earliest surviving
    Syriac manuscript already contains translations from Greek
    works. She even makes the point that some of these works show
    signs of having been corrected from earlier translations. This,
    too, supports the idea that the various groups in the Late
    Antique Near East did not live in isolation from one
    another.</p>

    Another interesting point relevant to the cultural mix in the
    area is found in Ammianus Marcellinus’ mention of a
    palace in Nisibis set aside for royal visits.<ref target="#FN98">98</ref> This, in
    itself, would surely increase the city’s influence on
    life and trade across longer distances than usual for a place
    its size. The crown was always a major patron and the presence
    of a royal residence in a city on the border would have a great
    impact on the economic, as well as the social, life of the city
    and the regions around it. Along these lines, we know that
    Nisibis had a mint in the Third Century.<ref target="#FN99">99</ref> This would also
    be a center of positive economic activity and a means of
    connection with the larger world. Both of these facts are
    further demonstration of the prominence of Nisibis’ place
    in the thoughts of those exercising political power over the
    area.</p>

    There is no point in rehearsing all the back-and-forth
    struggling between Rome and her rivals to the east: Persia and
    Parthia, for the control of Nisibis.<ref target="#FN100">100</ref> For our
    purposes, we need only understand how Nisibis functioned in the
    life of Mesopotamia and the political states that bordered on
    it. This role would have been ingrained in Ephrem’s view
    of the world as a part of his upbringing. So, we will try to
    take a broad enough look at Nisibis’ role in the
    political realm to help us understand this importance.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P64"/>[64]
    Nisibis is mentioned already in cuneiform texts<ref target="#FN101">101</ref> and seems
    to have kept its importance in all periods because of its
    natural position. The fact that Nisibis was the location of the
    treaty-signings between Rome and Persia shows its natural role
    as the meeting point of these two powers. The fact that its
    position allowed its possessor to project control of important
    routes explains why Armenia and Rome warred for its control as
    well as Persia and Rome.<ref target="#FN102">102</ref> It is interesting to know that
    a new city, named Tigranocerta and built about 37 Roman miles
    north-east of Nisibis, served as the southern capital of the
    Armenian kingdom of Tigranes for a time. This attempt to
    reproduce the natural advantages attached to Nisibis shows the
    desirability of the location in the eyes of people from the
    north as well as on the east and west.<ref target="#FN103">103</ref> The brief life
    of that city is most likely due to its position not enjoying
    the necessary physical attributes that the traditional site
    provided. Nature limits the number of areas suitable for
    settlement in Mesopotamia.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P65"/>[65] When
    Rome solidified her rule, Nisibis became the capital of the new
    imperial province, <hi rend="italic">Mesopotamia Provincia</hi>.<ref target="#FN104">104</ref>
    This shows us that Rome assumed a connection between possession
    of Nisibis and exercising control over that area.<ref target="#FN105">105</ref> It is likely that there was a legion
    present in Nisibis during this period, though we have no
    concrete evidence of this.<ref target="#FN106">106</ref> The presence of a Roman legion
    would have stirred the political, cultural and religious pots
    in the city all at once, though just how the effects would play
    out would depend on the particular legion present and where it
    had been raised.</p>

    There are natural military considerations common to all
    combatants in every age. (Though how these make themselves felt
    changes from age to age as technology changes warfare.) The
    persistence of the interest of all powers in the region in
    occupying and holding Nisibis is an important witness to its
    practical usefulness. This also means that the city’s
    inhabitants, in every age, would tend to see many people of all
    sorts passing through their midst. They would also have a
    natural interest in news of all sorts from every corner of the
    compass, given their history of involvement in warfare. The
    urge for self preservation is a strong spur to attention.</p>

    Political events before the life of Ephrem conspired to make
    Nisibis in his day even more central in importance than it
    might have been. Palmyra, a center of trade and travel that was
    profiting enough from these to extend its reach to oversee
    caravan travel over a wide area,<ref target="#FN107">107</ref> had been the victim of
    its queen’s attempt to break free from Roman domination
    in 272 and Nisibis and Edessa must have enjoyed comparative

      After these, there is our country, for it follows Mesopotamia
      and Osrhoene. Mesopotamia indeed has many and various cities,
      whose outstanding qualities I would like to relate. There are
      Nisibis and Edessa, which, among all of them, have the best
      men and are very acute in business and good at hunting. They
      are particularly wealthy and adorned with all [material]
      goods, for, purchasing from the Persians, they make trading
      journeys and sell [goods] throughout the whole land of the
      Romans, except for bronze and iron, because it is not
      permitted to hand over bronze or iron to enemies. But these
      cities always take their stands according to the wisdom of
      the gods and the emperor. Having celebrated walls, they
      always undo the might of the Persians in war. They are
      fervent in business and travel through all provinces [of the
      empire very] successfully. Hence, Edessa of Osrhoene is,
      itself, a splendid city.
    </quote>
         <p>The central focus of this passage on trade, and the Roman
    Empire’s attempts to regulate trade that it reports, show
    that these border cities benefited, financially, as much from
    their position as they may have been made vulnerable by it,
    militarily. This dual impact of the proximity of the border
    supports Elton’s suggestion of these areas being regions
    of increased activity rather than deserted military

         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P69"/>[69] The
    repeated assaults on Nisibis during this period cannot be
    reconstructed by us in detail. Even the actions of Shapur
    during the famous third siege and his use of the water of the
    river against the city’s walls, to which Ephrem is
    thought to refer in the first three of the <hi rend="italic">Carmina
    Nisibena</hi>, are, in Lightfoot’s opinion,<ref target="#FN111">111</ref>
    beyond our real understanding. (We should note, also,
    Ephrem’s mention in <hi rend="italic">Memre on Nicomedia</hi> 15.113 of
    the presence of elephants with the besieging forces as an
    enlightening detail that shows just how wide the experience of
    these border cities could be.) The conclusion we should draw
    from all this activity is clear, however: so great a value was
    placed on possession of Nisibis by Shapur that he was willing
    to waste armies and move rivers to acquire it.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P70"/>[70] The
    direct approach having failed for Shapur, Arsacius of Armenia
    (an ally of Persia at that point) arrived in Mygdonia in 359
    and treated the surroundings of Nisibis to such severe
    depredations they were left with only 10 percent of their
    previous population.<ref target="#FN112">112</ref> (This seems a strategy along
    the lines of the North's decision to burn the Shenandoah Valley
    and devastate Georgia and the Carolinas as a means of subduing
    the Confederate armies during the latter part of the American
    Civil War.) Nisibis having proved too tough a nut to crack
    directly, Persia thought that it could make life there
    unlivable. Ancient cities depended on their immediate
    neighborhoods for their sustenance, with the very few
    exceptions of some large seacoast cities such as Rome,
    Alexandria and Constantinople. A city like Nisibis, far from
    the sea and not even on one of the two great rivers of
    Mesopotamia, would have been especially vulnerable to indirect
    assault of this kind. If this approach had been continued over
    time by Persia and her adherents, it must have starved out
    Nisibis in the end, even without the spectacular defeat of
    Julian and his army in 363.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P71"/>[71] The
    political role of Nisibis, then, was to be the means of
    projecting power either on Rome's behalf toward the East or on
    behalf of Persia toward the West. Its great importance in
    assisting the power that controlled it to protect the border
    region made it an irresistible target, no matter who held it at
    any particular time. The very same qualities that supported its
    wealth and cosmopolitan character also made it a bone of
    contention. All these results of its natural position, both
    desirable and undesirable, gave to the people of this city a
    natural tendency to pay greater attention to the peoples and
    powers around them and to be more careful to develop a good
    understanding of the practicalities of power and the desires of
    political states than would people living farther from the
    frontier war zone. It is not surprising that a lifelong
    inhabitant of the city, such as Ephrem, would have a broader
    view of the world than one might expect to find in a person who
    was never a great traveler.</p>

         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P72"/>[72] At
    this point, it is not possible for us to identify a firm date
    for the arrival of Christianity in Nisibis as a resident
    religion. Christian communities tended to stretch their
    antecedents back into the past in search of an apostolic
    connection, as Edessa did, so famously, in the Addai legends.
    So, even if we had clear, specific testimony to the start of
    Nisibene Christianity, it might not be wholly convincing.
    Evidence from elsewhere about a community is more likely to be
    dependable, especially if it can be shown to have an early
    origin, because the urge for self-aggrandizement is less likely
    to be present. We are fortunate in the case of Nisibis in
    that this sort of clue, in fact, does provide our best guess
    for a <hi rend="italic">terminus ante quem</hi> for the Nisibene
    community. It makes sense to conclude that Christianity
    must have been present in Nisibis before 215 since the burial
    inscription of Abercius, which mentions Nisibis, seems to have
    been used as a model by a certain Alexander, son of Antonius,
    about that time.<ref target="#FN113">113</ref> The funerary stone of Abercius survives
    in a damaged state in the Vatican collection. This physical
    artifact is a very rare piece of evidence, indeed.<ref target="#FN114">114</ref>
         </p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P73"/>[73]
    Chaumont<ref target="#FN115">115</ref> thinks the epitaph of Abercius shows that
    Christians “n’étaient pas rares” in
    Osrhoene, even including Nisibis, at the time he visited there.
    She also, however, states clearly that she thinks the Christian
    communities in Nisibis and Edessa were naturally connected,
    with the latter taking the lead. We have seen above that
    Neusner considers the two cities to have had quite different,
    almost opposite, situations as far as the prevalence of the
    Synagogue and Church are concerned. I think it likely that
    Chaumont has assumed an importance for the Church in Edessa
    that our surviving texts might suggest but that the situation
    on the ground, as far as we can glimpse it, does not. The
    Edesso-centric nature of our records of early Syriac
    Christianity makes this a very difficult question to settle,
    while making its consideration a useful urge to caution.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P74"/>[74]
    Fiey<ref target="#FN116">116</ref> thinks Christians were in Nisibis by the end
    of the first century “modestement bien sûr”.
    He also accepts the Abercius inscription as reliable. He notes,
    too, that Roman occupation of Nisibis in 297 meant persecution
    for the Christians. Logic would suggest that the absence of
    that persecution before 297 would have helped whatever sprigs
    of Christianity there were in the city to grow more freely.

    thinks this was a natural step in response to the city's
    political importance, but doesn't say anything about the size
    of its Christian community having been a factor in this step of
    institutional maturation. Certainly, Shapur’s stressing
    his  role as a Zoroastrian monarch more and more in his
    public demeanor as his reign progressed would have made the
    seating of a bishop in Nisibis an obvious way for the Romans to
    stake a claim to the city by making the Church there more
    noticeable. The Christianity of the city would serve as a clear
    point at which Nisibis would appear

    Certainly, the corporate life of Christians in Nisibis before
    the time of bishop Jacob, whose rule of the community began
    during the very early years of Ephrem’s life, is
    something we can only speculate about on the basis of hints
    dropped during the period of Jacob and his successors. No

    Elias of Nisibis<ref target="#FN123">123</ref> (975-after 1049)<ref target="#FN124">124</ref> assigned
    Jacob’s accession to 308/9 and the construction of the
    Church to 313-320. It may well be that the Christian community
    during the period of the ban on the Church had grown large (or
    wealthy) enough to build and was merely waiting for the
    political climate to change. The Edict of Milan and the
    execution at Antioch by Licinius of Theotecnus, the leader of
    the attempted revival of traditional paganism that accompanied
    the persecution of Christians as part of the social reforms
    sponsored by the Emperor Maximin Daia in 306-313,<ref target="#FN125">125</ref>

    Jacob was quite a renowned figure in the mind of the early
    Church. We know of at least 55 texts, beyond Ephrem’s
    <hi rend="italic">Carmina Nisibena</hi>, that report some information about
    him.<ref target="#FN126">126</ref> Jacob was the first person added by
    Gennadius to Jerome’s <hi rend="italic">De Viris Illustribus</hi> and
    Theodoret placed him first in his <hi rend="italic">A History of the Monks of
    Syria</hi>, which shows that he was known in both Latin and
    Greek speaking circles. Much of this reportage appears to be
    legendary, but the prominence of this Nisibene figure in the
    mind of other Christians must, at least, have carried with it
    some awareness of the existence, and importance, of the
    community he led. His fame extended to inclusion in the lists
    of martyrs in Lyons and Rome.<ref target="#FN127">127</ref> The prominence this
    notice must have given to the Christians in Nisibis is
    remarkable, but does not further our detailed knowledge of the
    community’s history.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P81"/>[81] The
    report of Jacob’s presence at Nicaea,<ref target="#FN128">128</ref> might also be
    more the result of the new emperor's desire to include the
    Church all the way to the empire's eastern border in his public
    embrace than a reflection of the particular size and vibrancy
    of the Christian community there.<ref target="#FN129">129</ref> We must beware the
    pitfall of assuming important communities stood behind a
    well-known figure. Augustine was always the leader of a
    minority group in his native Hippo,<ref target="#FN130">130</ref> and
    Northampton, Mass., despite the presence of Jonathan Edwards,
    was certainly no Puritan ecclesiastical center. We should not
    allow Jacob’s notoriety or Ephrem’s creativity to
    lead us to assume that the Christian community in Nisibis was
    large or important. Extraordinary people can be produced by
    very ordinary circumstances. We need only recall the long
    career of Bach as a small town organist to be reminded of this
    fact.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P82"/>[82] The
    fact that Jacob’s body was a great talisman in Nisibis
    for centuries after his death<ref target="#FN131">131</ref> is further support for
    his having been, in some sense, that church’s founder.
    There seem to have been no earlier great figures with whom his
    memory had to compete. How different this is from Edessa, where
    Jesus himself was said to have been involved in the

      Vologeses, whose name appears in the baptistery inscription,

      This baptistery was erected and completed in the year 671 [=

            <anchor corresp="P86"/>[86] That
    sequence of only four leaders makes a very brief institutional
    life for the church of Nisibis and we cannot advance much
    beyond a skeletal picture of even that short period, all of
    which lay within Ephrem’s lifetime. What can we
    discover about these figures that will lend some color to the
    picture and an idea of their characters and how they actually
    functioned in the life of the Church in Nisibis? As we
    would expect, Ephrem’s works provide virtually all our
    information. The most prominent and concentrated place to
    find it is in the first 21 of the <hi rend="italic">Carmina

    star of the four.<ref target="#FN139">139</ref> It is not only the fact that he came
    first in time that set him apart. As the leader of the
    Christians in Nisibis, Jacob is mentioned a much greater number

      This analysis of the Jacob narratives suggests that
      trustworthy data about Jacob of Nisibis are very restricted.
      It can only be affirmed with reasonable certainty that: (1)
      he was a Bishop of Nisibis; (2) he participated in the
      council of Nicea as an anti-Arian; (3) he was known by
      Ephrem; (4) he achieved renown after, perhaps before, his
      death; (5) he died in 337/338; (6) he was initially buried in
      Nisibis, and, (7) he served four different regions of the
      fourth and fifth century world as an ideal bishop,
      contextualized according to different models.

    Ephrem calls himself “pupil” of the first three of
    these bishops,<ref target="#FN142">142</ref> which must be, as regards at least some
    of them, a sign of ecclesiastical deference instead of a
    natural respect for one’s elders, since he was an elderly
    and accomplished man at the time he wrote that line. The
    comment is an illuminating one in that it seems to place Ephrem
    firmly inside the traditional, institutional Church. However
    deep this feeling may have run in Ephrem,<ref target="#FN144">143</ref> its expression
    surely reveals him as not entertaining anti-institutional views
    on the appropriate role to be played by the laity and minor
    clergy.</p>

            <anchor corresp="P90"/>[90] It
    seems that, as the community grew, its needs changed and, says
    Ephrem, were met by the differing qualities of its leaders.
    There also seems to have been an increasing need for formal
    organization of the Christian community. So, we find Ephrem
    advising the new bishop, Abraham:<ref target="#FN145">145</ref>

         <p>It is hard to know exactly how to take this direction to

         <p>This is a more general comment and seems a clear indication
    of the existence of multiple congregations under the oversight
    of the bishop of Nisibis. Sozomen<ref target="#FN147">147</ref> recounts that the emperor
    Julian wrote to the inhabitants of Nisibis, who were asking for
    help against the Persians, and refused to succor them because
    they had become Christians. He told them to ask again when they
    had returned to paganism, Sozomen says! We would expect a group
    to grow in size if it enjoyed freedom to function and imperial
    favor, and complexity is usually an unavoidable accompaniment
    of growth. Still, we know that some small religious groups
    delight in intricate structures, while some large churches
    fight against institutional development.<ref target="#FN148">148</ref> We must
    remember to be a bit cautious when trying to gauge the size of
    the community by the length of the list of offices discussed by
    its members, though it is surely reasonable for us to posit an
    increase in size for this period in the life of the Church in
    Nisibis.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P91"/>[91] We

         <p>Are we to take this as evidence of a strong presence of
    those in some sort of formal religious life: “Sons or
    Daughters of the Covenant”? Are we to think that
    ‘sanctified’ means those already baptized,
    following the suggestion of some scholars that baptism in
    Syrian Christian churches was accompanied by a celibate
    life?<ref target="#FN150">150</ref> The most certain conclusion is that there
    were, among the recognized members of the Christian community,
    the clergy aside, at least two categories of members: those who
    were ‘sanctified’ and those who were not. The
    Church was clearly gaining formal structure.<ref target="#FN151">151</ref>
         </p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P92"/>[92] We
    also hear credible reports of structure and organization in
    liturgical practice at the time of Ephrem. The homily of Jacob
    of Sarug on Ephrem<ref target="#FN152">152</ref> contains some descriptions of changes
    in liturgical practice credited to Ephrem. The most
    prominent of these is the inclusion of women and girls in the
    liturgical singing that made up a part of the worship. There is
    not very much more than this, however, that we can say with
    real confidence about the shape and particular activities of
    the Christians in Nisibis during the life of Ephrem.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P93"/>[93] It
    is virtually certain that Ephrem was engaged in formal
    instruction of students in the Bible. We have commentaries
    of his that survive and the tradition associates him very
    strongly with this work. However, we cannot say anything
    about the sort of milieu in which this teaching took place, or
    even if it was for the clergy and other special groups, or for
    the membership of the congregation as a whole. (Logic points
    strongly to such study having been undertaken by a limited
    group, but there is no evidence to support that conclusion and
    the list of Christians who have engaged in serious study who
    would not have been expected to do so by the usual gate-keepers
    of education is very long and continues to grow. Our
    expectations in this area are a very uncertain guide.)</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P94"/>[94] It
    is extremely frustrating that, just when the Church in Nisibis
    is beginning to take on shape in our vision and we can hope for
    some firm basis from which to approach Ephrem’s work, the
    cart is upset and the bulk of the community is forced to make
    its way west to Edessa. Unfortunately, such is our melancholy
    case.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P95"/>[95] So,
    we come to the end of our rehearsal of what can be known about
    Nisibis during the life of Ephrem there. It is not a picture
    with many fine details, but it does furnish some backdrop
    against which we can hope to see him a bit more clearly. The
    student of Ephrem should not despair at the vagueness of our
    knowledge of his circumstances before his shift to Edessa. A
    general sense of his background can be useful when reading his
    works, and knowing the limits of our knowledge is always a
    useful element in scholarly study. It must be admitted, though,
    that we never quite leave the mist behind when we are studying
    Nisibis or the life of Ephrem the Syrian. He remains at a
    distance from us, despite our best efforts.</p>

    ironically, the scarcity of evidence for non-Greek cultures in

    Because this passage describes Nisibis as on the Euphrates, the

    9, suggests that this must be a different city from

    Nisibis, the Mygdonius, ran into the Euphrates downstream from
    the city, I can imagine Josephus thinking of it as a branch of
    the Euphrates. The reference is uncertain, but likely to be our
    Nisibis, in my judgment. <ref target="#FNRef36">

    in Persia under Shapur II. Neusner concludes that the different

    the sufferings of the Christians with complacency, this is a

            <ref target="#FNRef44">44</ref> It has been usual for scholars to assume

    final decade in Edessa. Drijvers, <hi rend="italic">Bardaisan</hi>, 127 says,
    “All his life, as monk, ascetic, and prolific author,
    Ephrem Syrus (306-373) made a stand for the cause of orthodoxy,
    for which he tried to gain acceptance in Syria. A native of
    Nisibis, he left this town in 363, when it became part of the
    Sassanide kingdom. After some wanderings, Ephrem then went to
    Edessa, where he founded the famous “School of the
    Persians” of which he was the first head. Now he was
    really confronted with heresies, which proliferated
    particularly in Edessa, and he fought against them with all his
    might.” Ross, <hi rend="italic">Roman Edessa</hi>, 123, says,
    “Arriving in Edessa after Rome’s surrender of his
    native Nisibis to the Persians in 363 CE, Ephrem found his new
    home to be a hotbed of what he considered to be execrable
    heresies. Christians of the strain approved by Ephrem,
    worshipping in a church established 50 years earlier by the
    orthodox Bishop Quna, were lost among a throng of followers of
    other teachers of a more or less ‘heretical’
    bent.” Neither of these two excerpts supplies citations
    from Ephrem’s writings or elsewhere that would lead one
    to the conviction that Edessa was more full of ideas Ephrem
    didn’t share than Nisibis, yet the point is assumed to be
    true. (I will not multiply passages from other scholars, but it
    would not be a difficult task.)<lb/>
            <lb/>
    If this idea of Ephrem being sparked to write the <hi rend="italic">Prose
    Refutations</hi> by the perilous state of Christianity in
    Edessa is correct, then we cannot assume that this level of
    contact was also present in Nisibis. If this assumption is
    another effect of the common default assumption of intellectual
    activity being a characteristic of the Church in Edessa, then
    we might think it wise to reconsider whether we are in a
    position to assign a provenance to the <hi rend="italic">Prose
    Refutations</hi> at all. My conviction is that the state of our
    knowledge does not permit us to decide between these two

    However, concrete evidence of this is not well known. (I have
    been given a citation in a Persian source for the text of the
    treaty entered into with Rome by Yazdegerd I in 409, which

            <ref target="#FNRef89">89</ref> Brock, “Greek and Syriac”, 153,
    says “It was undoubtedly the case that large numbers of
    people in Syria in Late Antiquity were bilingual in Greek and
    Aramaic; what is more difficult to establish is whether some of
    the more educated among these could also be described as
    bi-cultural, that is to say, people who felt at home in both
    Greek and Syriac literary cultures.” This suggestion,
    which brings to the fore the possibility that we need not seek
    to draw boundaries between the Hellenistic and Semitic cultural
    worlds, is useful. It encourages us to realize the
    individuality and malleability of human lives. Especially for
    those living in true border areas, those marking cultural as
    well as political divisions, such as Nisibis, life offered a
    wide array of possible influences and choices among which
    groups, families and individuals moved as seemed best and most
    advantageous to them. <ref target="#FNRef89">

            <hi rend="italic">Frontiers</hi>, 77. Bardy, <hi rend="italic">La
    question des langues</hi>, 26, thinks that the border conflicts
    between Rome and Persia/Parthia threw the Syriac-speaking
    Christians of the area back toward their Greek brethren to the
    West. He does not expand on this point, but it seems to come
    from an idea of the border as a hostile barrier. He supports it
    by noting the presence of so many translations of Greek works
    among the extant body of Syriac literature. This last point,
    based on the nature of Syriac literature, is a fascinating one,
    much debated by modern scholars. I would approach the question
    by wondering whether it might not be wiser to think that the
    large numbers of translated works were the result of
    theological, rather than cultural, affinities with those to the
    West, but I must pass over it for now. As far as the former
    point is concerned, I side with Elton’s picture. A
    support to that decision is offered by the description and
    details of cross-border movements presented by Lieu in
    “Captives, Refugees and Exiles”, <hi rend="italic">passim</hi>.
    Hodgson, “The East as Part”, also argues in support
    of borders as movement control areas rather than fortified
    lines of the World War I type, meant to seal off the enemy.

    follows: “In the long series of wars between the
    Sasanians on one side, and the Romans followed by the
    Byzantines on the other, the frontier remained more or less
    constant in upper Mesopotamia. It is true that sometimes
    Nisibis, Singara, Dārā and other cities of upper
    Mesopotamia changed hands, but the stability of the frontier
    over centuries is remarkable. Although the possession of
    frontier cities gave one empire a trade advantage over the
    other, one has the impression that the blood spilled in the
    warfare between the two states brought as little real gain to
    one side or the other as the few metres of land gained at
    terrible cost in the trench warfare of the First World
    War.” Greatrex, “The Background and
    Aftermath”, <hi rend="italic">passim</hi>, provides a clear sense of
    the complexity of the period’s military history while
    considering only a focused topic during a brief period.

    “Empire, Community and Culture”, 155-156.  The

    create a vacuum that competitors would rush to fill. Cf. also
    Stoneman, <hi rend="italic">Palmyra</hi>, 52, on the importance of Palmyra
    stemming from its location. The removal of that “pivot of

            <ref target="#FNRef119">119</ref> It is generally agreed by modern scholars
    that the motivation of Shapur II in oppressing Christians in
    his realm was, at base, political and that its religious
    element was taken on as a means of heightening the contrast
    between his realm and Christian Rome. In other words, the
    persecution of Christians by Persia is seen as a by-product of
    the renewed desire for war with Rome. Lebourt, <hi rend="italic">Le
    christianisme</hi>; Neusner, “Babylonian Jewry”;
    Moffett, <hi rend="italic">Christianity in Asia</hi> all agree on this.
    Gilman and Klimkeit, <hi rend="italic">Christians in Asia</hi>, see it more
    as a case of the shah allowing the Zoroastrian hierarchy to do
    what they had been wanting to do. These seem reasonable
    conclusions to me, though I think our knowledge of the
    motivations of ancient figures is very uncertain, especially
    given the scarcity of pre-Islamic materials from inside Persia.
    Still, none of this affects the usefulness to either side of

    sign of their having been so unusual. <ref target="#FNRef151">

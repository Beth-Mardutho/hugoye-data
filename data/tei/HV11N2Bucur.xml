         <div type="abstract">
            <p>This article pursues the intersection of
    angelology and Pneumatology in the writings of the so-called
    Persian Sage. The first part of the article takes its cue from
    the critique of Aphrahat's Pneumatology contained in a
    seventh-century letter by George, the monophysite bishop of the
    Arabs, and demonstrates that Aphrahat uses a cluster of
    biblical verses (Zech 3:9; 4:10; Isa 11:2-3; Matt 18:10) to
    support what is best designated as “angelomorphic
    Pneumatology.” The second part of the article attempts to
    integrate Aphrahat's angelomorphic Pneumatology within the
    larger theological framework described by scholars over the
    past century, namely in relation to Spirit Christology, and
    within a theological framework with a marked binitarian
    orientation.</p>

         <head xml:id="HV11N2Bucur3">Introduction</head>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P1"/>[1] In the
    conclusion of his article entitled “The Angelic Spirit in
    Early Judaism,” John Levison invited the scholarly
    community to use his work as “a suitable foundation for
    discussion of the angelic spirit” in early
    Christianity.<ref target="#FN1">1</ref> A few years later, Charles Gieschen's work on
    angelomorphic Christology and Mehrdad Fatehi’s study of
    Pauline Pneumatology also included dense but necessarily brief
    surveys of early Jewish and Christian examples
    “angelomorphic Pneumatology.”<ref target="#FN2">2</ref> The case for
    angelomorphic Pneumatology has been argued at length with
    respect to the Book of Revelation, the <hi rend="italic">Shepherd of
    Hermas</hi>, Justin Martyr, and Clement of Alexandria.<ref target="#FN3">3</ref> In what
    follows, I shall pursue the occurrence of angelomorphic
    Pneumatology in the writings of Aphrahat the Persian
    Sage.<ref target="#FN4">4</ref>
         </p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P2"/>[2] This
    author is judged to represent “Christianity in its most
    semitic form, still largely free from Greek cultural and
    theological influences.”<ref target="#FN5">5</ref> It is the unanimous judgment of
    scholars that Aphrahat is “entirely traditional,”
    in the sense that “he transmits the teaching that he
    received, lays out <hi rend="italic">testimonia</hi> pertaining to each
    topic, in order to convince or reassure a reader whose
    intelligence functions according to this logic of
    faith.”<ref target="#FN6">6</ref> His <hi rend="italic">Demonstrations</hi> are noted for their
    “archaism” or “traditionalism,” and
    represent, as has been said, a unique treasure-trove of older
    exegetical and doctrinal traditions.<ref target="#FN7">7</ref> This is why, even though he
    flourished in the fourth century, Aphrahat provides invaluable
    insight into earlier Christian doctrines and practices.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P3"/>[3]
    Aphrahat's Pneumatology has not been a neglected topic in
    scholarship. The pioneering studies by Friedrich Loofs and
    Ignatius Ortiz de Urbina, which to this day remain
    indispensable for the study of Aphrahat's Christology, contain
    much material of pneumatological relevance.<ref target="#FN8">8</ref> The above-mentioned
    study by Fredrikson on the opposition between the good and the
    evil spirits in the <hi rend="italic">Shepherd of Hermas</hi> also discusses
    Aphrahat's treatment of this topic.<ref target="#FN9">9</ref> Winfrid Cramer's book on
    early Syriac Pneumatology dedicates some thirty pages to
    Aphrahat, which were hailed as “the most thorough and ...
    without doubt the best study on this aspect of Aphrahat's
    theology.”<ref target="#FN10">10</ref> More recently, in a 2005 doctoral
    dissertation, Stephanie K. Skoyles Jarkins makes some valuable
    observations on the Sage, including his views on the Holy
    Spirit.<ref target="#FN11">11</ref>
         </p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P4"/>[4] In what
    follows I shall take my cue from a critique of Aphrahat's
    Pneumatology contained in a seventh-century letter addressed by
    George, the monophysite bishop of the Arabs, to a certain
    hieromonk Išo.<ref target="#FN12">12</ref> The third chapter of this epistle bears
    the following title: “Third Chapter, concerning that
    which the Persian writer also said, that, when people die, the
    animal spirit (<hi lang="SYR" dir="rtl" rend="syrMelthoEdessa" xml:lang="SYR">ܪܘܚܐ
    ܢܦܫܢܬܐ</hi> =
    <hi rend="gr">	ὸ πνεῦμα
	ὸ ψυχικόν</hi>) is
    buried in the body, being [lit. “which (= the animal
    spirit) is“] unconscious.”<ref target="#FN13">13</ref> It is, however,
    not the sleep of the soul in Syriac tradition that I intend to
    discuss, a topic already treated in scholarship.<ref target="#FN14">14</ref> I shall rather
    expand upon a remark in bishop George's letter, and argue that
    Aphrahat offers a valuable witness to the early Christian
    phenomenon already discussed in reference to Clement of
    Alexandria, namely the exegesis of Zech 3:9, Isa 11:2-3, and
    Matt 18:10 in support of an angelomorphic Pneumatology.
    Finally, I shall integrate Aphrahat's angelomorphic
    Pneumatology within the larger theological framework described
    by earlier scholarship, that is, in relation to Spirit
    Christology, and within a theological framework of marked
    binitarian character.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P5"/>[5] The
    terms “angelomorphic” and
    “angelomorphism” require some clarification.
    According to Crispin Fletcher-Louis, these terms are to be used
    “wherever there are signs that an individual or community
    possesses specifically angelic characteristics or status,
    though for whom identity cannot be reduce to that of an
    angel”<ref target="#FN15">15</ref> The virtue of this definition—and the
    reason for my substituting the term “angelomorphic
    pneumatology” for Levison’s “angelic
    Spirit”—is that it signals the use of angelic
    <hi rend="italic">characteristics</hi> in descriptions of God or humans,
    while not necessarily implying that the latter are angels
    <hi rend="italic">stricto sensu:</hi> neither “angelomorphic
    Christology” nor “angelomorphic Pneumatology”
    imply the simple identification of Christ or the Holy Spirit
    with angels.<ref target="#FN16">16</ref>
         </p>
         <head xml:id="HV11N2Bucur4">Aphrahat's Pneumatology: "Many Aberrations and Very
    Crass Statements"</head>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P6"/>[6]
    According to the seventh-century Bishop George of the Arabs,
    one should not waste much sleep over the writings of the
    “Persian Sage.”<ref target="#FN17">17</ref> This otherwise unknown writer
    could not have been Ephrem's disciple, because the character
    [<hi lang="SYR" dir="rtl" rend="syrMelthoEdessa" xml:lang="SYR">ܝܘܩܢܐ</hi> = <hi rend="gr">εἰκών</hi>] of his teaching
    is unlike that of Mār Ephrem's.<ref target="#FN18">18</ref> Indeed, Aphrahat
    was “not among those who confessed the approved teachings
    (<hi lang="SYR" dir="rtl" rend="syrMelthoEdessa" xml:lang="SYR">ܡ̈ܠܦܢܘܬܐ
    ܚܬܝ̈ܬܬܐ</hi>) of the
    teachers that were approved.”<ref target="#FN19">19</ref> His writings contain
    “many aberrations and very crass
    statements.”<ref target="#FN20">20</ref>
         </p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P7"/>[7] Clearly,
    Bishop George does not think very highly of the Persian Sage.
    His addressee, on the other hand, has read the
    <hi rend="italic">Demonstrations</hi> front to back, and is most likely an
    admirer of Aphrahat's. This is why the bishop proceeds with
    caution: he concedes that the Persian writer was of a
    “sharp nature,” and that he studied (lit.
    “ploughed”) the Scriptures with great diligence.
    Some of the flaws, such as, for instance, the grave
    misunderstanding of Pauline statements in 1 Corinthians 15,
    might be due to the fact that Aphrahat did not have access to
    correct versions of the Scriptures.<ref target="#FN21">21</ref> Or perhaps, in his time and
    place, he did not have the possibility “to apply himself
    (lit. “his heart,” <hi lang="SYR" dir="rtl" rend="syrMelthoEdessa" xml:lang="SYR">ܕܢܣܼܝܡ
    ܠܒܿܠܗ</hi>) and conform his
    opinions (<hi lang="SYR" dir="rtl" rend="syrMelthoEdessa" xml:lang="SYR">ܚܘܫܒܵܐ</hi>)”
    to the teachings of more trustworthy writers.<ref target="#FN22">22</ref>
         </p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P8"/>[8] At one
    point, however, Bishop George seems to have run out of
    sugarcoating, for he bluntly states that Aphrahat's views about
    the Holy Spirit are both stupid and blasphemous. Just as the
    ideas about the animal spirit are an example of
    “crassness and boorish ignorance (<hi lang="SYR" dir="rtl" rend="syrMelthoEdessa" xml:lang="SYR">ܕܥܒܝܘܬܐ
    ܘܠܐ
    ܝܠܝܦܘܬܐ
    ܩܘܪܝܝܬܐ</hi>),”
    so also are those statements that seem to equate the Holy
    Spirit with the angels:</p>
         <quote>
            <p>You see, my brother, the crassness of the conceptions
      (<hi lang="SYR" dir="rtl" rend="syrMelthoEdessa" xml:lang="SYR">ܥܓܘܪܘܬܐ
      ܕܡ̈ܠܐ</hi>); what sort of
      honor they ascribe to the Holy Spirit; how he understands the
      angels of the believers, of whom our Lord has said that they
      always see the face of his Father. He also holds this opinion
      in that which he says towards the end of the
      <hi rend="italic">Demonstration</hi> On the Resurrection of the
      Dead.<ref target="#FN23">23</ref>
            </p>
         </quote>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P9"/>[9] Bishop
    George refers, first, to <hi rend="italic">Dem</hi>. 6.15, where, as I shall
    show later, Aphrahat uses Matt 18:10 to illustrate the
    intercessory activity of the Holy Spirit. The “crassness
    of the conceptions” (<hi lang="SYR" dir="rtl" rend="syrMelthoEdessa" xml:lang="SYR">ܥܓܘܪܘܬܐ
    ܕܡ̈ܠܐ</hi>) does not refer to
    words or expressions but to Aphrahat's notion of the Holy
    Spirit as interceding like an angel, and the underlying
    exegesis of Matt 18:10.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P10"/>[10] The
    second reference is most likely to <hi rend="italic">Dem</hi>. 8.23 (I/404),
    a text using the same imagery of the Spirit as intercessor
    before the throne of God, albeit without the reference to Matt
    18:10. Bishop George's point is that Aphrahat's bothersome
    connection between the angels of Matt 18:10 and the Holy Spirit
    was not a slip of the pen, due to lack of attention or
    doctrinal vigilance, but rather a case of repeated, consistent,
    and therefore characteristic “crassness and boorish
    ignorance.”</p>
         <p>So much for the reception of Aphrahat's Pneumatology by the
    guardians of later Orthodoxy. I now move to those passages of
    the Sage.</p>
         <head xml:id="HV11N2Bucur5">The Seven Operations of the Spirit are Six</head>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P11"/>[11] The
    following passage occurs in Aphrahat's first
    <hi rend="italic">Demonstrations</hi>:</p>
         <quote>
      And concerning this Stone he stated and showed: <hi rend="italic">on this
      stone, behold, I open seven eyes</hi> [Zech 3:9]. And what
      are the seven eyes opened on the stone other than the Spirit
      of God that dwelt (<hi lang="SYR" dir="rtl" rend="syrMelthoEdessa" xml:lang="SYR">ܕܫܪܬ</hi>) upon Christ with
      seven operations (<hi lang="SYR" dir="rtl" rend="syrMelthoEdessa" xml:lang="SYR">ܣܘܥܪ̈ܢܝܢ</hi>)?
      As Isaiah the prophet said, <hi rend="italic">There will rest</hi>
      (<hi lang="SYR" dir="rtl" rend="syrMelthoEdessa" xml:lang="SYR">ܬܬܢܝܚ</hi>) <hi rend="italic">and
      dwell</hi> (<hi lang="SYR" dir="rtl" rend="syrMelthoEdessa" xml:lang="SYR">ܘܬܫܪܐ</hi>) <hi rend="italic">upon
      him God's Spirit of wisdom and of understanding and of
      counsel and of courage, and of knowledge, and of the fear of
      the Lord</hi> [Isa 11:2-3]. These are the seven eyes that
      were opened upon the stone [Zech 3:9], and <hi rend="italic">these are the
      seven eyes of the Lord which look upon all the earth</hi>
      [Zech 4:10].<ref target="#FN24">24</ref>
         </quote>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P12"/>[12]
    Aphrahat combines Isaiah' seven gifts of the Spirit with
    Zechariah's seven eyes on the stone (Zech 3:9), and “the
    eyes of the LORD [i.e., his angelic servants], which look upon
    all the earth” (Zech 4:10). Isaiah 11:2 is quoted in a
    distinctly Syriac form, with an additional verb
    (<hi rend="italic">&amp;rā</hi>) complementing the single “to
    rest” in the Hebrew and Greek.<ref target="#FN25">25</ref> Nothing
    extraordinary here; except that, on closer examination,
    Aphrahat's “seven operations” of the Spirit are
    only six: wisdom, understanding, counsel, courage, knowledge,
    and fear of the Lord!<ref target="#FN26">26</ref>
         </p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P13"/>[13]
    Neither the Hebrew of Isa 11:2-3 (whether MT or the <hi rend="italic">Great
    Isaiah Scroll</hi> at Qumran), nor the Peshittā, nor the
    Syriac quoted by Aphrahat, nor the Targum Jonathan, mention a
    seventh “spirit” at Isa 11:3.<ref target="#FN27">27</ref> While the
    messianic interpretation of Isa 11:1-2 is not unknown in
    rabbinic Judaism,<ref target="#FN28">28</ref> the use of this verse to support the
    notion of the <hi rend="italic">sevenfold</hi> spirit resting on the Messiah
    seems absent from both Second Temple apocalyptic writings and
    rabbinic literature.<ref target="#FN29">29</ref> It is noteworthy that the <hi rend="italic">Midrash
    Rabbah</hi> uses Isa 11:2 in a speculation about the
    <hi rend="italic">six</hi> spirits on the Messiah.<ref target="#FN30">30</ref> This is similar
    to the Ps.-Philonic homily “On Samson,” which also
    enumerates six spirits by referring to the “fear of the
    Lord” only once, as <hi rend="gr">πνεῦμα
    φόβου
    θεοῦ</hi>.<ref target="#FN31">31</ref> This seems to be
    a Jewish precursor of the idea of seven spirits resting on the
    Messiah in Isa 11:2-3, universally disseminated among Christian
    writers, which opens up the possibility of combining this text
    with Zech 3:9 and 4:10.<ref target="#FN32">32</ref>
         </p>
         <p>It is the very strong Christian tradition about the seven
    spirits resting on the Messiah that functions as Aphrahat's
    hermeneutical presupposition, allowing him to speak of seven
    operations of the Spirit, even though his biblical text only
    mentions six.<ref target="#FN33">33</ref>

            <anchor corresp="P14"/>[14] I
    move now to a text that provoked Bishop George's outrage:</p>
         <quote>
      Anyone who has preserved the Spirit of Christ in purity: when
      it [the Spirit] goes to him [Christ], it [the Spirit] speaks
      to him thus: <hi rend="italic">the body to which I went and which put me

      Christ for the resurrection of the body that preserved it in

      waters [of baptism] and wearies [<hi lang="SYR" dir="rtl" rend="syrMelthoEdessa" xml:lang="SYR">ܘܡܥܝܩ</hi>] it: it [the
      Spirit] departs from that person ... and goes to its nature,
      [namely] unto Christ, and accuses that man of having grieved
      it ... And, indeed, my beloved, this Spirit, which the
      Prophets have received, and which we, too, have received, is
      not at all times found with those that receive it; rather it
      sometimes goes to him that sent it, and sometimes it goes to
      him that received it. Hearken to that which our Lord said,
      <hi rend="italic">Do not despise any one of these little ones that believe

    These passages are usually discussed in reference to Aphrahat's
    doctrine of “the sleep of the soul” and his
    distinction between the “animal spirit”
    (<hi lang="SYR" dir="rtl" rend="syrMelthoEdessa" xml:lang="SYR">ܪܘܚܐ

    must not lose sight, however, of the fact that the passage is
    part of the <hi rend="italic">Demonstration</hi> “On the Sons of the
    Covenant,” and that Aphrahat argues here one of the
    axioms of his ascetic theory, namely that the Holy Spirit
    departs from a sinful person and goes to accuse that person
    before the throne of God. According to the Sage, Christians
    receive the Spirit at Baptism. If one keeps the Spirit in
    purity, the latter will advocate for that person before the
    throne of God; if, on the contrary, one indulges in sinful
    behavior, the Spirit leaves the house of the soul—which
    allows the adversary to break in and occupy it (<hi rend="italic">Dem.</hi>
    6.17)—and goes to accuse the person before God.<ref target="#FN36">36</ref>

         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P17"/>[17]
    Indication that this is an inherited tradition can be found in
    the striking similarities with the <hi rend="italic">Shepherd of
    Hermas</hi>.<ref target="#FN37">37</ref> There are, however, no Syriac manuscripts of
    the <hi rend="italic">Shepherd</hi>, and no references to this work among
    Syriac writers.<ref target="#FN38">38</ref> Fredrikson raises the hypothesis of a common
    source behind both Aphrahat and the <hi rend="italic">Shepherd</hi>, a source
    whose views of spiritual dualism and divine indwelling would
    have been similar to that of the Community Rule at
    Qumran.<ref target="#FN39">39</ref> We must perhaps consider the idea of a massive
    Palestinian-Syriac cluster of ascetic vocabulary and imagery,
    passed on by the earliest Christian missionaries to communities
    in Syria and Alexandria.<ref target="#FN40">40</ref>
         </p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P18"/>[18] For
    Aphrahat, then, the notion that the Spirit can be present in
    the believer, and subsequently leave, being driven away by evil
    spirits, was part of a traditional ascetic theory. In the
    course of the Messalian controversy this view became highly
    controversial. Most significant in this respect is the treatise
    <hi rend="italic">On the Inhabitation of the Holy Spirit</hi> composed by
    Philoxenus of Mabbug (+ 523) with the express aim of showing
    that “the Holy Spirit whom, by the grace of God, we have
    received from the waters of baptism at the moment when we were
    baptized, we did not receive so that he would sometimes remain
    with us and some other times abide afar from
    us...”<ref target="#FN41">41</ref> According to Philoxenus, the Spirit
    “does not flee from the soul in which he dwelled at the
    moment of sin and return when it would repent, as was the
    assertion of one who blurted out stupidly.” <ref target="#FN42">42</ref>
         </p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P19"/>[19] It
    is noteworthy, however, that even while he writes to dismantle
    the ascetic theories espoused in the <hi rend="italic">Demonstrations</hi>,
    Philoxenus continues to use the very same imagery and biblical
    passages (albeit to opposite ends), thus confirming the
    traditional character and widespread appeal of the theology set
    forth by the Sage.<ref target="#FN43">43</ref>
         </p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P20"/>[20] What
    seems to have been overlooked is the intimate link between
    Aphrahat's notion of the Spirit departing to intercede for or
    against the believer, on the one hand, and the angelomorphic
    representation of the Holy Spirit, on the other. Indeed,
    Aphrahat describes the work of the Holy Spirit in unmistakably
    angelic imagery: the Spirit “is always on the
    move,” he stands before the divine throne, beholds the
    Face of God, entreats Christ on behalf of the worthy ascetics,
    accuses the unworthy, etc. It is significant that the action of
    carrying prayers from earth to the throne of God is sometimes
    ascribed to the archangel Gabriel. <ref target="#FN44">44</ref> This is again similar to
    the <hi rend="italic">Shepherd</hi> (Herm. <hi rend="italic">Sim.</hi> 8.2.5), where the
    archangel Michael states that, in addition to the inspection of
    the believers' good deeds by one of his angelic subordinates,
    he will personally test every soul again, at the heavenly altar
    (<hi rend="gr">ἐγὼ
    αὐ	οὺς ἐπὶ
	ὸ
    θυσιασ	ήριον
    δοκιμάσω</hi>).
    Both Aphrahat and the <hi rend="italic">Shepherd</hi> deploy the traditional
    imagery of angels carrying up the prayer of humans to the
    heavenly altar.<ref target="#FN45">45</ref>
         </p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P21"/>[21] In
    the case of Aphrahat, the angelomorphic element is even more
    pronounced, given that the Spirit's to-and-fro between earth
    and heaven, and his intercession before the divine throne, are
    “documented” with an unlikely proof-text, namely
    Matt 18:10 (“their angels in heaven always behold the
    face of my Father”). In his commentary on the
    Diatessaron, Ephrem Syrus interprets “the angels of the
    little ones” as a metaphor for the prayers of the
    believers, which reach up to the highest heavens. Later Syriac
    authors (Jacob of Edessa, Išodad of Merv, Dionysius Bar
    Salibi) use Matt 18:10 as a proof-text for the existence of
    guardian angels.<ref target="#FN46">46</ref> For Aphrahat, however, the angels of Matt
    18:10 illustrate the intercessory activity <hi rend="italic">of the Holy
    Spirit</hi>.</p>
         <head xml:id="HV11N2Bucur7">An Older Exegetical Tradition</head>

         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P22"/>[22]
    Scholars disagree on how the data presented above are to be
    interpreted. According to Kretschmar, Aphrahat does not
    distinguish clearly between the guardian angel, the many
    (angelic) spirits, and the one Spirit of God; neither does he
    distinguish between “spirit” as impersonal gift and
    “spirit” as a personal angel. The Sage's use of
    Matt 18:10 would be an instance in which the Spirit is placed
    on the same level as the angels: “der Geist [wird] also
    mit den Engeln gleichgesetzt.”<ref target="#FN47">47</ref>
         </p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P23"/>[23]
    Cramer reacted sharply, asserting that Kretschmar had
    completely misunderstood the relevant texts and misrepresented
    Aphrahat's thought by means of infelicitous formulations, which
    led to further unwarranted and aberrant conjectures.<ref target="#FN48">48</ref> In his
    view, the equation between angels and the Spirit is improbable,
    because Aphrahat never uses <hi lang="SYR" dir="rtl" rend="syrMelthoEdessa" xml:lang="SYR">ܪܘܚܐ</hi> for angelic entities;
    moreover, the Sage does not use Matt 18:10 in a literal sense,
    but rather understands “the angels of the little
    ones” as a metaphorical expression for the
    Spirit.<ref target="#FN49">49</ref>
         </p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P24"/>[24] I
    agree with some elements in Cramer's critique, but disagree
    with much of what he affirms. Kretschmar's association with the
    guardian angel is indeed textually unfounded, although the
    confusion is perhaps understandable.<ref target="#FN50">50</ref> An earlier
    scholar of Aphrahat, Paul Schwen, proceeds with more caution,
    writing that the notion of the guardian angel is an occasional
    contributor to Aphrahat's “hesitant and
    inconsistent” Pneumatology.<ref target="#FN51">51</ref> It is also true a simple
    “Gleichstellung” of the Holy Spirit with the
    angels, as in Kretschmar's formulation, does not account for
    the complexity of the Sage's thought. More precisely, even
    though <hi rend="italic">Dem.</hi> 6 uses the angels of Matt 18:10 to
    illustrate the intercessory activity <hi rend="italic">of the Holy
    Spirit</hi>, this is neither the only way in which Aphrahat
    interprets Matt 18:10 nor the only image he uses for the Holy
    Spirit.<ref target="#FN52">52</ref>
         </p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P25"/>[25] I
    doubt, however, that Cramer's use of the phrases “literal
    sense,” “proper sense,” and
    “metaphorical expression” is any more felicitous or
    appropriate for describing Aphrahat's exegesis. After all, the
    Sage's statements about the Spirit were later deemed scandalous
    precisely because of their handling of “the angels of the
    believers” in Matt 18:10 and “the sort of honor
    they ascribed to the Holy Spirit.” At least in the eyes
    of Bishop George, the problem was that Aphrahat interprets the
    angels of the little ones quite “properly” and
    “literally,” to use Cramer's phrases, as the Holy
    Spirit. As for the argument that Aphrahat did not call angels
    “spirits,” the widespread occurrence of the
    “angelic spirit” (in the Hebrew Bible, the LXX, the
    Dead Sea Scrolls, various authors of the Alexandrian diaspora,
    and the New Testament), which I have mentioned repeatedly in
    this study, suggests the existence of a tradition that the Sage
    would have considered authoritative. Whether the
    <hi rend="italic">Demonstrations</hi> explicitly call angels
    “spirits” becomes irrelevant.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P26"/>[26] It
    is interesting that Cramer is ready to speak of
    “anthropomorphic traits” in Aphrahat's depiction of
    the Spirit's eschatological actions.<ref target="#FN53">53</ref> The imagery of
    the relevant passage (<hi rend="italic">Dem</hi>. 6.14 [I/296]), however, is
    clearly angelomorphic rather than anthropomorphic: the end-time
    ministry of the Spirit includes going before Christ, opening
    the graves, clothing the resurrected in glorious garments, and
    leading them to the heavenly king.<ref target="#FN54">54</ref> This description is
    immediately followed by the reference to “this
    Spirit” being constantly on the move between heaven and
    earth, and the biblical proof text—Matt 18:10!</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P27"/>[27] I
    conclude, agreeing with Kretschmar, that the Sage does provide
    a witness to the tradition of angelomorphic Pneumatology.
    “Tradition” is the proper term to use, because
    Aphrahat is by no means an exception in his time. As I
    mentioned earlier, this way of thinking about the Holy Spirit
    was still an option in the fourth century.<ref target="#FN55">55</ref> Aphrahat's
    contemporary, Eusebius of Caesarea, writes the following:</p>
         <quote>
      ... the Holy Spirit is also eternally present at the throne
      of God, since also “thousands of thousand are present
      before him,” according to Daniel (Dan 7:10); he also
      was sent, at one time in the form of a dove over the Son of
      man, at another time over each of the prophets and apostles.
      Therefore he also was said to come forth from the Father. And
      why are you amazed? About the devil it was also said,
      “and the devil went forth from the Lord” (Job
      1:12); and again, a second time, was it said “so the
      devil went forth from the Lord” (Job 2:7). And you
      would also find about Ahab where the Scripture adds
      “and there went forth the evil spirit and stood before
      the Lord and said ‘I shall trick him’” (1
      Kgs 22:21). But these are adverse spirits, and now is not the
      proper time to investigate just how and in what way this was
      said.<ref target="#FN56">56</ref>
         </quote>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P28"/>[28] The
    use of Matt 18:10 as a pneumatological proof-text does not
    mean, however, that Aphrahat himself consciously and actively
    promoted an angelomorphic Pneumatology. First, the
    “angelomorphic Spirit” is one representation of the
    Holy Spirit among several others in the
    <hi rend="italic">Demonstrations</hi>. To paraphrase Bruns' presentation of
    Aphrahat's Christology, it could be said that the Sage's
    Pneumatology is “open,” inasmuch as the
    accumulation of symbols (mother, spouse, medicine, angels of
    the face) moves asymptotically towards the inexhaustible
    experience of the Spirit, resulting in a multicolored picture
    book of pneumatological impressions, rather than a unitary
    theology of the Holy Spirit.<ref target="#FN57">57</ref>
         </p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P29"/>[29]
    Second, it is quite obvious, from the way he writes, that
    Aphrahat does not see himself as proposing anything new or
    unusual. This is in keeping with the general character of his
    theology. It is very likely, therefore, that Aphrahat's use of
    Matt 18:10 is one such received tradition.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P30"/>[30] The
    passages from <hi rend="italic">Dem</hi>. 6 and <hi rend="italic">Dem</hi>. 1, quoted
    above, share the same theme (the Holy Spirit), and the same
    formal structure (both provide Scriptures proof for the
    activity of the Holy Spirit). The connection between Zech 4:10,
    Isa 11:1-3, and Matt 18:10 illustrates very well what Pierre
    calls a “network of scriptural traditions,” which
    Aphrahat inherited from earlier Christian tradition.<ref target="#FN58">58</ref> That
    this is, indeed, the case, is made clear by the occurrence of

    features, in descending order, the Face of God, the seven first

    5:6.<ref target="#FN61">61</ref> He understands all these passages to be

    There can be no doubt that Clement of Alexandria echoes Second
    Temple Jewish angelological speculations, and that among the
    direct predecessors of his <hi rend="italic">protoctist</hi> one should count
    the seven spirits of Revelation (Rev 1:4, 3:1, 4:5, 5:6; 8:2),
    the “first created ones” (<hi rend="gr">πρῶ	οι

            <anchor corresp="P34"/>[34]
    Clement’s seven <hi rend="italic">protoctists</hi>, however, also carry
    a definite pneumatological content, since they are identified
    not only with various types of angels, but also with the
    “seven spirits resting on the rod that springs from the
    root of Jesse” (Isa 11:2-3, LXX) and “the heptad of
    the Spirit.”<ref target="#FN65">65</ref> It appears, in conclusion, that, in
    Clement’s interpretation of Matt 18:10, “the face
    of God” is a Christological title, while the angels
    contemplating the Face occupy a theological area at the
    confluence of angelology and pneumatology.<ref target="#FN66">66</ref>

    3:9; 4:10), “the seven gifts of the Spirit” (Isa
    11:2-3), and “the angels of the little ones” (Matt
    18:10); both echo the tradition about the highest angelic
    company; finally, both use angelic imagery to express a
    definite pneumatological content. This is one of several
    convergences between Aphrahat and earlier writers in the West,

    Gilles Quispel was convinced that behind both Clement and

    Still formulaic, but more elaborate and personal, is the

         <quote>
      As for me, I just believe firmly that God is one, who made
      the heavens and the earth from the beginning ... and spoke
      with Moses on account of his meekness, and himself spoke with
      all the prophets, and, moreover [<hi lang="SYR" dir="rtl" rend="syrMelthoEdessa" xml:lang="SYR">ܬܘܒ</hi>], sent his Christ into the
      world.<ref target="#FN77">77</ref>
         </quote>
         <p>It is noteworthy that this passage contains nothing about
    the Holy Spirit, and that the similar composition in
    <hi rend="italic">Dem</hi>. 1.19, quoted earlier, contains merely an oblique
    reference to Christ sending from his Spirit into the
    prophets.<ref target="#FN78">78</ref> It is true, on the other hand, that, when
    Aphrahat elsewhere treats the “moments” preceding
    the sending of the Spirit in the Creed (namely cosmogony,
    anthropogony, the giving of the Law, and the inspiration of the
    prophets) he usually mentions the Spirit.<ref target="#FN79">79</ref> The fact remains,
    however, that the Creed refers to the Spirit only in its fourth
    article, and that this reference does not contain anything
    specifically Christian. As Cramer notes, the statement could
    just as well have been made by Philo.<ref target="#FN80">80</ref>

            <anchor corresp="P42"/>[42] As
    early as 1907, Schwen noted that Aphrahat's notion of the
    Spirit was hesitant and inconsistent.<ref target="#FN81">81</ref> Far from being
    conceived of as a divine person, on par with the Father and the
    Son, Aphrahat's “Holy Spirit” is at times
    indistinguishable from the ascended Christ (e.g., <hi rend="italic">Dem.</hi>
    6.10 [I/281]), at other times simply an impersonal divine
    power, similar to the rays of the sun (e.g., <hi rend="italic">Dem.</hi> 6.11
    [I/284]), and occasionally merged with the notion of the
    guardian angel (e.g., <hi rend="italic">Dem</hi>. 6.14 [I/296]).<ref target="#FN82">82</ref> For
    Bruns also, and even for Ortiz de Urbina, who is a defender of
    Aphrahat's fundamental orthodoxy, many passages in the
    <hi rend="italic">Demonstrations</hi> present the Spirit as an impersonal
    divine “grace” or “power.”<ref target="#FN83">83</ref> The
    personal elements would only occur in the
    “dramatism” of the eschatological scene, the
    “saddening” of the spirit, and the
    mother-image.<ref target="#FN84">84</ref>

    several instances (<hi rend="italic">Dem.</hi> 6.11 [I/286]; 20.16 [I/919]),
    Aphrahat focuses exclusively on “God and his
    Christ” so that, according to Loofs, “there is no
    place left for the Spirit.”<ref target="#FN85">85</ref> Moreover, the
    <hi rend="italic">Demonstrations</hi> seem to use “Spirit,”
    “Spirit of Christ,” and “Christ”
    interchangeably. Especially with respect to the inhabitation of
    God in the believers, any distinction vanishes.<ref target="#FN86">86</ref> Cramer noted
    that the Sage “almost” identifies Christ and the
    Spirit—“almost,” because the use of
    “spirit” in trinitarian formulas would prevent full
    identification.<ref target="#FN87">87</ref> In light of my earlier statements above, I
    find Cramer's recourse to formulas unconvincing. At first sight
    at least, it is more accurate to conclude with Schwen that the
    Sage had no doctrine of the Trinity “in the sense of
    later Church dogma,” and that his thought would be better
    termed “binitarian” than
    “trinitarian.”<ref target="#FN88">88</ref>
         </p>

            <anchor corresp="P44"/>[44]
    Loofs attempted to place Aphrahat's
    “Geistchristologie” and “binitarianism”
    in a larger religio-historical perspective. In his
    interpretation, “spirit” is, for Aphrahat, simply a
    way of referring to the divinity of Christ prior to the
    Incarnation. “Spirit” should not, however, be
    understood by analogy with the Logos-hypostasis of other
    patristic writers, as a second hypostasis alongside the Father,
    since, for Aphrahat, the differentiation of the Spirit from the
    Father occurred only at the Incarnation. Prior to the
    Incarnation, the Spirit represents, by analogy with Power,
    Wisdom, or Presence in pre-Christian Jewish thought, a divine
    attribute rather than a distinct entity. <ref target="#FN89">89</ref> Aphrahat
    distinguishes “Spirit” and “Christ”
    only when speaking about the man Jesus, and it is this
    historical Jesus Christ that Aphrahat has in mind when he uses
    the phrase “God and his Christ.” According to
    Loofs, the Sage's perspective switches back and forth between
    the preexisting <hi rend="gr">πνεῦμα</hi> and the
    historical Jesus Christ.<ref target="#FN90">90</ref> Finally, this formula does not
    introduce any alteration of strict monotheism, given that the
    reign of the Son is seen as temporary, ultimately to end by
    being delivered to the sole God (<hi rend="italic">Dem.</hi> 6.12
    [I/287]).<ref target="#FN91">91</ref> Loofs' conclusions were severely criticized by
    Ortiz de Urbina, later also by Vööbus and Bruns, who
    all argued that Aphrahat views Christ as pre-existent with the
    Father prior to the Incarnation, and that he has a clear
    understanding of the distinction between the risen Christ and
    the Spirit.<ref target="#FN92">92</ref>
         </p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P45"/>[45] The
    texts remain, however, ambiguous. One of the passages invoked
    by Ortiz de Urbina, <hi rend="italic">Dem.</hi> 6.10 [I/281]), is quite
    telling. Aphrahat speaks here about the Logos becoming flesh
    (quoting John 1:14), then returning bearing “that which
    he had not brought with him,” thus raising humanity to
    heaven (quoting Eph 2:6), and sending the Spirit in his stead.
    This seems to affirm the preexistence of Christ as Logos, as
    well as the clear distinction between the ascended Christ and
    the Spirit he sends to his disciples. Yet the sending of the
    Spirit is documented not with a reference to the paraclete, but
    rather with Matt 28:20, a christological text: “when he
    went to his Father, he sent to us his Spirit and said to us
    <hi rend="italic">I am with you until the end of the
    world</hi>.”<ref target="#FN93">93</ref>
         </p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P46"/>[46]
    What, then, of the relation between “Christ,”
    “the Spirit of Christ,” and “the Holy
    Spirit” in Aphrahat? Bruns notes that “the sending
    of the Spirit is identical with the presence of Christ,”
    and suggests that the Spirit is the medium through which Christ
    dwells in the believers, and especially in the
    prophets.<ref target="#FN94">94</ref> In other words, Christ dwells in the Spirit,
    and the Spirit dwells in the human being—which suggested
    Skoyles Jarkins' phrase “matroshki-doll
    Christology.”<ref target="#FN95">95</ref> More needs to be said, however, about
    this indwelling.</p>

         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P47"/>[47] The
    difficulties outlined in the previous section never seem to
    have existed as such for Aphrahat. The reason is quite simple:
    the Sage's point of departure is not metaphysical—God in
    Godself, or the “ad intra”; relation of
    “divine Persons”—but rather, to use Bruns'
    very apt phrase, “die Anrufbarkeit und liturgische
    Erfahrbarkeit des einen Gottes in drei Namen.”<ref target="#FN96">96</ref> For
    Aphrahat, then, the “problem” of explaining the
    relation between the Father and the Spirit, or between Christ
    (whether “preincarnate” or
    “post-resurrectional”) and the Spirit simply did
    not present itself as such. His statements about the Spirit
    come in response to a different set of questions:</p>
         <quote>
            <p>Since Christ is one, and one his Father, how is it that
      Christ and his Father dwell in the believers?</p>
            <p>Now, Christ is seated at the right hand of his Father, and
      Christ dwells in human beings ... And though he dwells among
      many, he is seated at the right hand of his Father.<ref target="#FN97">97</ref>
            </p>
         </quote>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P48"/>[48]
    Aphrahat's notion of the Spirit will become more easily
    understandable if we consider these questions, and inquire
    about the role of the Holy Spirit in the multiplicity of
    creation and the charismatic life of the Church. Although it is
    certainly not a novelty in scholarship, this perspective has so
    far not been given enough attention.<ref target="#FN98">98</ref> I now return to
    Aphrahat:</p>
         <quote>
      Our Lord ... left us a pledge of his own (<hi lang="SYR" dir="rtl" rend="syrMelthoEdessa" xml:lang="SYR">ܪܗܒܘܢܐ

      ascended... it behooves us also to honor that which is his,
      which we have received ... let us honor that which is his,
      according to his own nature. If we honor it, we shall go to
      him... But if we despise it, he will take away from us that
      which he has given us and if we abuse his pledge (<hi lang="SYR" dir="rtl" rend="syrMelthoEdessa" xml:lang="SYR">ܘܐܢ ܢܟܘܡ
      ܥܠ

      there take away that which is his, and will deprive us of
      that which he has promised us.<ref target="#FN99">99</ref>
         </quote>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P49"/>[49] It
    is quite evident that “the pledge“ (<hi lang="SYR" dir="rtl" rend="syrMelthoEdessa" xml:lang="SYR">ܪܗܒܘܢܐ</hi>,
    <hi rend="gr">ἀρραβών</hi>) refers
    to the Spirit. There is, first, the allusion to biblical texts
    (2 Cor 1:22; 5:5; Eph 1:14); then, also, the obvious parallels
    with statements made elsewhere in <hi rend="italic">Dem.</hi> 6, where the
    same is said in reference to the Holy Spirit.<ref target="#FN100">100</ref>
         </p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P50"/>[50] To
    explain how it is that Christ is divided among believers and
    dwells in them without thereby forsaking his unity and dignity,
    Aphrahat suggests several comparisons. Just as the one sun is
    manifested to a multiplicity of receivers in that “its
    power is poured out in the earth”—that is, by means
    of the multiplicity of his rays—so also “God and
    his Christ, though they are one, yet dwell in human beings, who
    are many.”<ref target="#FN101">101</ref>
         </p>
         <head xml:id="HV11N2Bucur13">Excursus: "Wisdom" and "Power" as Pneumatological
    Terms</head>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P51"/>[51]
    Towards the end of his comparison between Christ and the sun,
    Aphrahat mentions the power of God (<hi lang="SYR" dir="rtl" rend="syrMelthoEdessa" xml:lang="SYR">ܚܝܠܗ
    ܕܐܠܗܐ</hi>): “the sun in
    heaven is not diminished when it sends out its power upon the
    earth. How much greater is the power of God, since it is by the
    power of God that the sun itself subsists.”<ref target="#FN102">102</ref>
    Bruns is probably right in speaking about the Spirit as
    (non-hypostatic) “göttlich-dynamische Kraft”
    mediating between the transcendent God and the world.<ref target="#FN103">103</ref>
    Earlier, Aphrahat had stated that Christ, even though one,
    “is able to [be] above and beneath” and
    “dwell in many,” by means of his Father's
    wisdom<ref target="#FN104">104</ref> (<hi lang="SYR" dir="rtl" rend="syrMelthoEdessa" xml:lang="SYR">ܒܚܟܡܬܗ
    ܕܐܒܘܗ̱ܝ</hi>). This
    prompted Ortiz de Urbina to suggest that Aphrahat may have
    equated <hi lang="SYR" dir="rtl" rend="syrMelthoEdessa" xml:lang="SYR">ܪܘܚܐ</hi>
    (<hi rend="gr">πνεῦμα</hi>)
    with <hi lang="SYR" dir="rtl" rend="syrMelthoEdessa" xml:lang="SYR">ܚܟܡܬܐ</hi>
    (<hi rend="gr">σοφία</hi>),
    two words that were feminine in his time.<ref target="#FN105">105</ref>
         </p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P52"/>[52] I
    think that more can be added to this discussion. In
    <hi rend="italic">Dem.</hi> 10.8, “wisdom” seems to constitute a
    divine gift imparted freely to the Christian
    “shepherds,” which, therefore, calls for generous
    transmission from the clergy to the Christian people. Christ is
    “the steward of wisdom.” This coheres well with the
    earlier statement in <hi rend="italic">Dem.</hi> 6: “And Christ
    received the Spirit not by measure, but his Father loved him
    and delivered all into his hands, <hi rend="italic">and gave him authority
    over all his treasure</hi>.”<ref target="#FN106">106</ref> Moreover, just
    as Aphrahat had said earlier (<hi rend="italic">Dem.</hi> 6.10-12) about the
    Spirit of Christ, “this wisdom is divided among many (
    <hi lang="SYR" dir="rtl" rend="syrMelthoEdessa" xml:lang="SYR">ܐܬܦܠܓܬ
    ܠܣܓܝ̈ܐܐ</hi>) yet is
    in no way diminished, as I have shown to you above: the
    prophets received of the spirit of Christ. (<hi lang="SYR" dir="rtl" rend="syrMelthoEdessa" xml:lang="SYR">ܕܡܢ ܪܘܚܗ
    ܕܡܫܝܚܐ
    ܩܒܠܘ
    ܢܒܝ̈ܐ</hi>), yet Christ was in
    no way diminished.”<ref target="#FN107">107</ref> Obviously, the Sage takes
    “wisdom“ and “Spirit of Christ” as
    synonyms.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P53"/>[53] In
    conclusion, “wisdom” refers to the Spirit
    understood as divine power, presence, gift, etc., while Christ
    is the treasurer and giver of the Spirit. Aphrahat seems to
    have felt a certain tension between this view and that
    expressed in 1 Cor 1:24, because he feels compelled to
    quotation this verse without however offering any explanation:
    “And while he is the steward of the wisdom, again, as the
    Apostle said: <hi rend="italic">Christ is the power of God and his
    wisdom.</hi>”</p>
         <p>* * *</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P54"/>[54]
    Aphrahat has of course much more to offer than comparisons
    drawn from nature. His argumentation from Scripture is
    particularly interesting. According to <hi rend="italic">Dem.</hi> 14, the
    believers are like the fertile ground that accepted the seed
    sown by the Lord (Luke 8:15). The seeds are nothing else than
    the Spirit of the Lord, poured out over all the flesh (Joel
    3:1), but accepted only by a few.<ref target="#FN108">108</ref> The prophets
    “received [a portion] from the Spirit of Christ, each one
    of them as he was able to bear.”<ref target="#FN109">109</ref> In the new
    dispensation, “[a portion] from the Spirit of Christ
    (<hi lang="SYR" dir="rtl" rend="syrMelthoEdessa" xml:lang="SYR">ܪܘܚܗ ܬܘܒ
    ܕܝܠܗ
    ܕܡܫܝܚܐ
    ܘܡܢ</hi>) is again poured forth today upon
    all flesh [Joel 3:1].”<ref target="#FN110">110</ref> As a result, Christ now
    overshadows all believers—each of them severally
    (<hi lang="SYR" dir="rtl" rend="syrMelthoEdessa" xml:lang="SYR">ܡܢܬܐ
    ܡܢܬܐ</hi>).<hi dir="ltr">
               <ref target="#FN111">111</ref>

         </p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P55"/>[55]
    Obviously, for Aphrahat the Spirit “multiplies”
    Christ, making him available to the prophets and all believers.
    The imagery is quite crude, as the Sage seems particularly fond
    of “part-to-whole” explanations. Several times he
    refers to God sending “[a portion] of his Spirit upon the
    prophets”: the prophets received [a portion] from the
    Spirit of Christ; John the Baptist, the greatest among
    prophets, still received the Spirit “according to
    measure” (<hi lang="SYR" dir="rtl" rend="syrMelthoEdessa" xml:lang="SYR">ܒܟܝܠܬܐ</hi>); [a
    portion] from the Spirit of Christ is again poured forth today
    upon all flesh [Joel 3:1]; Christ overshadows each of the
    believers severally; at Baptism, believers receive the Holy
    Spirit “from a little portion of the
    Godhead.”<ref target="#FN112">112</ref> The insertion of “portion”
    in my English rendering of the phrase is justified. In his
    footnotes to the German translation of the
    <hi rend="italic">Demonstrations</hi>, Bruns points to the “exceedingly
    materialistic” imagery of expressions such as <hi lang="SYR" dir="rtl" rend="syrMelthoEdessa" xml:lang="SYR">ܡܢܬܐ
    ܡܢܬܐ</hi> (“severally,”
    “one by one”) for the presence of the Spirit in the
    prophets, or <hi lang="SYR" dir="rtl" rend="syrMelthoEdessa" xml:lang="SYR">ܡܢ ܒܨܪܐ
    ܕܐܠܗܘܬܐ</hi>
    (“a little portion/ particle of the Godhead”), for
    the gift of the Spirit received at Baptism.<ref target="#FN113">113</ref>
         </p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P56"/>[56] The
    difference between the Spirit present in the prophets and the
    Spirit in the historical Jesus Christ is one of degree:
    partially present in the prophets, the Spirit is fully present
    in Christ.<ref target="#FN114">114</ref> In <hi rend="italic">Dem.</hi> 6.12 [I/285], the
    proof-text for Christ is John 3:34: “it was not by
    measure that his Father gave the Spirit unto him.” For
    the partial presence of the Spirit in the prophets, on the
    other hand, Aphrahat quotes Num 11:17 (God taking “from
    the Spirit” of Moses to endow the seventy
    elders).<ref target="#FN115">115</ref> But he also refers to something that
    “the blessed apostle said”: <hi rend="italic">God distributed
    from the Spirit of Christ and sent it into the
    prophets</hi>.<ref target="#FN116">116</ref>
         </p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P57"/>[57] Even
    though scholarship is not unanimous on this point, I find it
    indisputable that Aphrahat is quoting “the blessed
    apostle” according to <hi rend="italic">3 Cor.</hi>, an apocryphal text
    that Aphrahat and Ephrem seem to have regarded as
    canonical.<ref target="#FN117">117</ref> The relevant verse (<hi rend="italic">3 Cor.</hi> 2.10)
    reads as follows: “For he [God] desired to save the house
    of Israel. Therefore, distributing from the Spirit of Christ,
    he sent it into the prophets” (<hi rend="gr">μερεῖσας
    οὖν ἀπὸ 	οῦ
    πνεύμα	ος
	οῦ Χρισ	οῦ
    ἔπεμψεν

         </p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P58"/>[58] The
    notion of a partial endowment of the prophets with the gifts of
    the Spirit, and the comparison of this partial charismatic
    endowment with the complete and sovereign possession of the
    Spirit by Jesus Christ, are ancient and widespread themes.
    Aside from <hi rend="italic">3 Cor.</hi>, I have already mentioned its use in
    the Ps.-Philonic homily “On Samson” and in Justin
    Martyr's <hi rend="italic">Dialog with Trypho</hi>. It appears that the
    Persian Sage bears witness to the existence of the same
    tradition in the early Syriac milieu. If Aphrahat identifies
    the “pledge” or the “Spirit” as the
    spiritual gifts that the Church received from the ascended
    Christ in fulfillment of Joel 3:1 (“I shall pour out my
    Spirit on all flesh”), Justin articulates the very same
    idea by combining Joel 3:1 with Isa 11:2-3 (the gifts of the
    Spirit) and Ps 67/68:19 (the ascension: “He ascended on
    high, he led captivity captive, he gave gifts to the sons of
    men”).<ref target="#FN119">119</ref>
         </p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P59"/>[59] The
    texts I have discussed so far lead to the conclusion that
    Aphrahat's Pneumatology can be considered from at least two
    vantage-points. On the one hand, the <hi rend="italic">Demonstrations</hi>
    are passing on received formulas, most of which contain
    references to “spirit.” On the other hand, the
    meaning of “spirit” in these formulas is given by
    reflection on the charismatic endowment of the prophets and the
    “pledge” of Christ received at Baptism. In this
    light, “spirit” is understood as divine
    “operations” (<hi lang="SYR" dir="rtl" rend="syrMelthoEdessa" xml:lang="SYR">ܣܘܥܪ̈ܢܝܢ</hi>)
    in the believer, which convey the presence of Christ, with all
    that derives from such presence.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P60"/>[60] In
    Aphrahat's thought, the intimate relation between Christ and
    the Spirit is likened to the relation between the sun and the
    rays of sun, the sower and the seeds, or the treasure-holder
    and the riches of the treasure-house. In more abstract terms,
    it is the relationship between simple unity and
    unity-as-multiplicity, i.e., divine unity become accessible to
    the religious experience. For further elucidation of this
    aspect, it is necessary to return briefly to the topic of
    angelomorphic Pneumatology.</p>
         <head xml:id="HV11N2Bucur14">The "Fragmentary" Gift of the Spirit and
    Angelomorphic Pneumatology</head>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P61"/>[61] It
    may seem that the angelomorphic Pneumatology discussed in the
    first part of this section and the pneumatological conceptions
    presented in the second part are not necessarily related. Such
    is not the case, however.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P62"/>[62] In
    <hi rend="italic">Dem.</hi> 6.10 [I/277-280], Christians are asked not to
    <hi rend="italic">despise</hi> “the pledge”—i.e., the gift
    of the Holy Spirit—received at Baptism. The notion of
    “despising” the Spirit is significant here.
    Aphrahat returns to it later in the same
    <hi rend="italic">Demonstration</hi>, also supplying a fitting Scriptural
    proof: “the Spirit that the prophets received, and which
    we, too, have received” is indicated by something
    “that our Lord said, <hi rend="italic">Do not despise any of these
    little ones that believe in Me, for their angels in heaven
    always gaze on the face of my Father.</hi>”<ref target="#FN120">120</ref>

    Aphrahat's notion of “fragmentary” Spirit-endowment
    and his angelomorphic Pneumatology should be considered
    jointly, as in the case of Justin and Clement. As I have shown,
    Justin and Clement understand the seven gifts of the spirit in
    the Isaiah passage as seven highest angelic powers; Clement
    even identified the seven spirits with the “angels”
    of Matt 18:10. In Aphrahat this identification is not explicit.
    Unlike Justin Martyr, who uses Isa 11:1-3 to contrast the
    “partial” outpouring of the Spirit over the
    prophets and Christ's “full” and sovereign
    possession of the Spirit, Aphrahat only uses the Isaiah verse
    to illustrate the latter.<ref target="#FN121">121</ref> In other words, Isa 11:2
    serves, in <hi rend="italic">Dem.</hi> 1, the same role as John 3:34 in
    <hi rend="italic">Dem.</hi> 6. Aphrahat does say that the prophets received
    only “[a portion] from the Spirit of Christ, each one of
    them as he was able to bear”—but he prefers to use
    <hi rend="italic">3 Cor.</hi> 2.10 rather than Isa 11:2 in support of this
    statement. Matthew 18:10 is therefore never connected with Isa
    11:2 to affirm the dynamism of divine indwelling, the partial
    endowment of prophets and baptized Christians, and the
    intercessory activity of the Spirit. In Aphrahat, Matt 18:10 is
    instead linked to other texts such as 2 Cor 1:22; 5:5; Eph
    1:14; <hi rend="italic">3 Cor.</hi> 2.10; Num 11:17; 2 Sam 16:14-23 (the evil
    spirit sent to Saul).</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P"/>[] It is true
    that this particular arrangement of the proof-texts is
    determined by the necessities of the discourse, and that, in
    other contexts, Aphrahat would most likely have furnished a
    different “constellation” using the same passages.
    As the texts stand, however, the scriptural support for
    Aphrahat's doctrine of “partial versus complete”
    possession of the Spirit differs slightly from that of Justin
    and Clement. By way of consequence, the link between the notion
    of “fragmentary Spirit” and angelomorphic
    Pneumatology is also less clear than it is in these
    authors.</p>
         <head xml:id="HV11N2Bucur15">Conclusions</head>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P65"/>[65] I
    noted in the beginning that John Levison documented the
    widespread use, in pre- and post-exilic Judaism, of the term
    “spirit” as a designation of angelic presence. This
    tradition continued, of course, in Christianity, and recent
    scholarship has documented its presence in the New Testament,
    the <hi rend="italic">Shepherd of Hermas</hi>, Justin Martyr, and Clement of
    Alexandria. In the first part of this article, I have argued
    that Aphrahat witnesses to the existence of angelomorphic
    Pneumatology in the early Syriac tradition, which was supported
    by an exegesis of biblical texts (Matt 18:10; Zech 3:9; 4:10;
    Isa 11:2-3) very similar to that of earlier and unrelated
    strands of Christianity. From a historical perspective,
    angelomorphic pneumatology was a significant phase in Christian
    reflection on the Holy Spirit. Still an option in the fourth
    century, and traditional not only for Aphrahat, angelomorphic
    pneumatology was bound to be discarded in the wake of the Arian
    and Pneumatomachian controversies. The associated use of Matt
    18:10 was also discontinued.<ref target="#FN122">122</ref>
         </p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P66"/>[66] The
    connection, in Aphrahat's <hi rend="italic">Demonstrations</hi>, between the
    ascetic doctrine of the indwelling Spirit, on the one hand, and
    the angelomorphic representation of the Spirit, on the other,
    is also significant from a history-of-ideas perspective. As
    mentioned above, the idea that the Spirit would depart from the
    sinful person was rejected in the course of the Messalian
    controversy. The ascetic doctrine, however, survived in an
    altered form, as can be seen in Isaac of Nineveh: if the Holy
    Spirit, once received in baptism, does not leave, it is the
    guardian angel who is driven away by one's sins, and this
    departure leaves the house of the soul open to demonic
    influences.<ref target="#FN123">123</ref> In other words, the angelomorphism of the
    older Pneumatology was relegated to a “real”
    (guardian) angel, while the pneumatological content was
    conformed to the conciliar theology of the Spirit and the
    sacraments.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P67"/>[67] In
    the second part of the article I have discussed Aphrahat's
    treatment of the Spirit in relation to Christ, and concluded
    that the blurring of lines between “Christ,”
    “Spirit of Christ,” and “Holy Spirit”
    is best understood as an attempt to convey the
    “multiplication” of Christ in the world in (or
    through) the work of the Spirit. In all likelihood, Aphrahat
    did not view the angelic imagery and the notion of
    “particles of the Spirit” as distinct elements. I
    submit that this represents one of the layers of tradition that
    Aphrahat has preserved, and which can be identified more
    specifically with the primitive stage of trinitarian thought
    proposed by Kretschmar, namely “die Trias
    Gott-Christus-Engel.”<ref target="#FN124">124</ref> This theological complex
    is still visible in Aphrahat's <hi rend="italic">Demonstrations</hi>, and it
    can be verified by recourse to earlier authors, most notably
    Justin Martyr and Clement of Alexandria.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P68"/>[68] I
    have shown how Aphrahat's angelomorphic Pneumatology is an
    integral part of his ascetic theory. It is true that that the
    angelomorphism of the Spirit is one way (among several others)
    of expressing the subordination of Pneumatology to Christology,
    which is one of the characteristic features of Aphrahat's
    thought.<ref target="#FN125">125</ref> There is no doubt that Aphrahat is aware of
    trinitarian formulas. Nevertheless, in his own reflection of
    the Holy Spirit, the Sage is mostly concerned with the Spirit's
    “operations” that make possible the experience of
    divine indwelling. In agreement with Loofs and Bruns, I
    conclude that he speaks of the Holy Spirit not as an
    independent hypostasis, but rather as divine power from Christ.
    Within this overall binitarian framework of the
    <hi rend="italic">Demonstrations</hi>, the experience of the Spirit is
    expressed by recourse to traditional angelomorphic
    language.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P69"/>[69]
    Measuring Aphrahat's angelomorphic Pneumatology against the
    standard of later Orthodoxy, Bishop George had good reason to
    decry the heretical “aberrations,”
    “crassness,” and “boorish ignorance” of
    the <hi rend="italic">Demonstrations</hi>. Considered from a different
    perspective, however, these same writings are the invaluable
    “treasure trove” described by Vööbus. It
    is therefore imperative to do just what the bishop counseled
    against, namely “wear ourselves out with questions and
    become clouded over in our minds in order to make sense of and
    understand the import of all the words written in the book of
    the <hi rend="italic">Demonstrations</hi>.”</p>_______<lb/>

    be “excused” for some of his views on grounds that
    he represents an earlier stage of theological reflection. Such
    an interpretation would reflect the mindset of modern
    Patristics more than the mind of patristic authors. It is

    thinks that Aphrahat might have counted “the Spirit of
    God” as one of the seven gifts of the Spirit. I find this
    very unlikely. First, Aphrahat speaks about two terms: the
    Spirit and the seven operations of the Spirit. Second, there is
    an obvious parallelism between “the Spirit of God that
    abode on Christ with seven operations,” and the
    immediately following proof text from Isa 11:2-3:
    “<hi rend="italic">The Spirit of God shall rest and dwell upon
    him,”</hi> followed by the “seven” (in
    reality six) gifts of the Spirit. Finally, all patristic

            <ref target="#FNRef50">50</ref> Aphrahat draws a connection between the
    angels of Matt 18:10 and the Holy Spirit, but does not refer to
    the guardian angel. This was already noted by Loofs
    (<hi rend="italic">Theophilus</hi>, 270 n. 3). Other patristic writers use
    Matt 18:10 as a proof-text for the existence of guardian
    angels—but make no reference to the Spirit (e.g., Basil,
    <hi rend="italic">Adv. Eun.</hi> 3.1; Cramer's article also refers to later
    Syriac authors: Jacob of Edessa, Išodad of Merv,
    Dionysius Bar Salibi). Finally, in Valentianian quarters (and
    later in certain strands of Islam), the guardian angel seems to
    have been identified as the Holy Spirit—but with no
    reference to Matt 18:10. See Gilles Quispel, “Das ewige

    and the Spirit as Mother. Loofs (<hi rend="italic">Theophilus</hi>, 275 n. 6)
    explains that “für die erbauliche Verwendung von
    Gen. 2, 24, an der ihm hier lag, allein der Geist, weil im
    Syrischen ein Femininum, sich eignete, nicht aber 'der Messias'
    (Christus).” In fact, as the context shows, Aphrahat's
    interest is more than vaguely “edifying”: he is
    here thinking of God and his Spirit-consort as genitors of the
    transformed ascetics, and is interested in linking the
    “spirituals” with their “mother,” the
    Spirit. Moreover, he is also bowing to the pressure of an

    “‘Will you really leave us until your coming? Where
    will we find a teacher?’ And he answered and said to us,
    ‘Do you not know that until now I am both here and there
    with him who sent me? ... I am wholly in the Father and the
    Father in me.’” The long treatment of the relation
    between Christ and his disciples after the ascension, even
    though heavily indebted to the farewell discourse in the Gospel
    of John, diverges from the latter precisely on the problem of
    the paraclete. According to Julian Hills (<hi rend="italic">Tradition and
    Composition in the Epistula Apostolorum</hi> [HDR 24;
    Minneapolis, Minn.: Fortress, 1990], 123), “[t]he crisis
    of the Lord's departure is resolved in the Fourth Gospel by the
    coming of the Spirit ... In the Epistula it turns on the
    presence of the risen Lord among the disciples ...”
    Instead of the paraclete, <hi rend="italic">Ep. Apos.</hi> insists on the
    perfect unity of Christ with the Father and, implicitly, on

            <ref target="#FNRef100">100</ref> In the text just quoted, Christ leaves his
    pledge upon his ascension, just as in another passage
    “when he went to his Father, he sent to us his
    Spirit” (<hi rend="italic">Dem.</hi> 6.10 [I/282]); the exhortation to
    “honor the pledge” finds counterpart in an earlier
    exhortation, to “honor the spirit of Christ, that we may

    148-153. Pierre expresses extreme reservation on the issue of

    (“Introduction,” 139 n. 73) that the Sage may
    “perhaps” have known 3 Corinthians, but does not
    think that Aphrahat's Creed (<hi rend="italic">Dem.</hi> 1.19 [I/44]) echoes
    this text. Nowhere in the critical apparatus to the

    where Aphrahat again mentions “the Apostle who bears

    “Christ Jesus [some mss: Jesus Christ] was born of Mary
    of the seed of David by the Holy Spirit.” Cf. Ignatius,

            <ref target="#FNRef123">123</ref> Isaac of Nineveh, <hi rend="italic">Homily</hi> 57:
    “First a man withdraws his mind from his proper care and
    thereafter the spirit of pride approaches him. When he tarries
    in pride, the angel of providence, who is near him and stirs in
    him care for righteousness, withdraws from him. And when a man
    wrongs his angel and the angel departs from him, then the alien
    [the devil] draws nigh him, and from henceforth he has no care
    whatever for righteousness.” The English translation is
    that of Dana Miller (<hi rend="italic">The Ascetical Homilies of Saint Isaac
    the Syrian</hi> [Boston, Mass.: The Holy Transfiguration
    Monastery, 1984], 283). In his homily on Ps. 33:8 (PG 29: 3 B),
    a verse that reads “the angel of the Lord will encamp
    around those who fear him and will deliver them” (LXX),
    Basil writes: “An angel attends to anyone who has
    believed unto the Lord, unless we chase him away (<hi rend="gr">ἀποδιώξωμεν</hi>)

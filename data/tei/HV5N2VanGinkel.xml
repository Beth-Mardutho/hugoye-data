            <anchor corresp="P1"/>[1] Prof.
    Dr. Han J.W. Drijvers passed away on 11 February 2002 at the
    age of 67. He was a retired professor of Semitic Languages and
    Literature and Archaeology of the Near East at the University
    of Groningen, the Netherlands.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P2"/>[2] Born 25
    September 1934 in Winschoten, a little provincial town in the
    North of the Netherlands, Han Drijvers always remained rooted
    in Groningen, the province he loved so much. In his grammar
    school years he already showed great interest in the phenomenon
    of religion. As a result he decided to study theology at the
    University of Groningen, where he came into contact with the
    Semitic languages. He decided to graduate in both Theology and
    Semitics. After writing a Ph.D. on <hi rend="italic">Bardaisan of Edessa</hi>
    (1966) he received a personal lectureship in Semitic Literature
    and Linguistics at the faculty of Arts (1970) and, in addition,
    in the Religions of the Era of Hellenism and the Roman Empire
    at the faculty of Theology (1972). This combination of Language
    and (Religious) Culture has characterised his career and is
    reflected in his publications on many topics ranging from the
    earliest stages of ancient Syriac literature to the history and
    religions of the Near Eastand Hellenism, archaeology and
    religious phenomenology. Next to his dissertation his edition
    of <hi rend="italic">The Book of the Laws of Countries: Dialogue on Fate of
    Bardaisan of Edessa</hi> (1965) and his study <hi rend="italic">Cults and
    Beliefs at Edessa</hi> (1980) are but two of his numerous
    publications.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P3"/>[3] In 1976
    his lectureship was converted into a personal professorate.
    After the retirement of his mentor in Semitics, Prof. Dr. J.H.
    Hospers, Han Drijvers became the professor in ordinary at the
    Institute of Semitic Languages and Cultures, and Archaeology of
    the Near East of the University of Groningen (1986). In earlier
    years he already had been involved in the development of this
    department, but now he guided it rather effectively through the
    rough seas of budget cuts and academic "restructuring". Under
    his supervision several dissertations on Syriac and related
    topics were written and Groningen became a household name in
    the field of Syriac Studies.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P4"/>[4] Drijvers
    not only has made a name for himself as a scholar, but also as
    an administrator. He has been, among others, a member of the
    University Board (1972-1974) and Dean of the Faculty of Arts
    (1981-1984). He also has been a member of many national and
    international academic committees and boards. Most Syriac
    scholars will remember him presiding the business meetings at
    various Symposia Syriaca. He has been a participant of all
    symposia, except for the last, when his physical condition made
    it impossible for him to travel to Sydney - much to his
    regret.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P5"/>[5] Han
    Drijvers not only was an academic, but he also was an active
    member of society. He was, for example, a member of the
    national Blood Transfusion Board and he was involved in the
    encouragement and study of modern art. As main editor he was
    involved in a number of studies on regional artists. At his
    retirement in 1999 he was appointed by the queen Companion of
    the Order of Orange Nassau for his achievements in academics
    and in society.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P6"/>[6] During
    the last years of his life Han was hampered by a disease, not
    even he was able to conquer. He did put up a brave fight, but
    in February of this year it finally got the better of him. He
    will be missed.</p>

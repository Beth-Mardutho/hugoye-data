            <p xml:lang="en">Increased access to archives and collections has made working with manuscripts
                routine in many areas of scholarship on the Syriac tradition. A great number of
                unedited texts are now easily accessible in digital form. Further, the study of
                material culture has demonstrated how manuscripts participated in social networks
                surrounding the texts they preserve. Manuscripts will remain a focus of Syriac
                studies for the foreseeable future. The need for methodological clarity and
                precision on practices from the description of manuscripts and scripts to the
                editing of the texts is pressing. The set of articles in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Comparative Oriental Manuscripts Studies: An Introduction</hi> represents an
                opportunity to learn from neighboring fields of study.</p>
            <p xml:lang="en"> This volume is an introductory handbook on comparative oriental manuscript studies
                that emerged from a five-year collaborative project supported by the European
                Science Foundation. It is divided into a general introduction and five edited
                chapters that feature contributions from seventy-two specialists. The introduction
                examines twelve different manuscript traditions: Arabic, Armenian, Avestan,
                Caucasian Albanian, Christian Palestinian Aramaic, Coptic, Ethiopic, Georgian,
                Greek, Hebrew, Slavonic, and Syriac. The five edited chapters consider individual
                aspects of manuscript research from a comparative perspective: (1) codicology, (2)
                palaeography, (3) textual criticism and text editing, (4) cataloguing, and (5)
                conservation and preservation. Readers will appreciate the large number of color
                illustrations and detailed table of contents. The end matter includes a
                comprehensive bibliography and several indexes: languages and traditions, pla-ces,
                persons and works, institutions and projects, collections<pb n="429"/> and manuscripts, papyri,
                and a general index. A searchable digital file of the volume is freely available
                online.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn1" n="1"><p rend="footnote text">

            <p xml:lang="en"> The organization of each part is heterogeneous. The extensive first chapter (pp.
                70–266), edited by Marilena Maniaci, treats codicology. An introduction offers an
                overview of seven categories: (1) materials and tools, (2) book forms, (3) the
                making of the codex, (4) the layout of the page, (5) text structure and readability,
                (6) the scribe, the painter, and the illuminator at work, and (7) bookbinding.
                Studies on manuscripts in ten languages follow, authored by specialists in each
                field. The section on each language addresses, in so far as possible, the seven
                categories. This enables a quick comparison of the tendencies in different
                traditions. As Maniaci suggests, this chapter enables “one to speak of a ‘universal
                grammar’ of the manuscript book (and in particular of the codex)” (p. 69).</p>
            <p xml:lang="en"> The shorter second chapter (pp. 267–320), edited by Paola Buzi and Marilena Maniaci,
                discusses palaeography. A brief introduction describes the method of palaeographic
                analysis and identifies problems in the field: competing views on the object of the
                study of palaeography (i.e., only the formal aspects of writing or the entire
                sociology of writing cultures), a lack of shared terminology, and confusion over the
                meaning of common terms. Individual studies on nine of the ten languages examined in
                the first chapter take different approaches to describing the palaeographic
                tendencies. Readers may use these studies to consider the relationship between
                different traditions, but the comparative emphasis of this volume does not feature
                as strongly in this chapter.</p>
            <p xml:lang="en"> The third chapter (pp. 321–465), edited by Caroline Macé et al., addresses textual
                criticism and text editing. The first two sections in this chapter provide an
                overview of the principles of neo-Lachmannian textual criticism and a useful guide
                to producing an edition. The third section features twenty-one case studies on
                editing texts that examine challenges with producing editions, based on their genre,
                conditions of<pb n="430"/> production, inclusion in specific types of collection, linguistic
                register, relationship to other texts, textual fluidity, among other topics. These
                contributions represent some of the more forward-looking aspects of the volume. The
                two contributions specifically related to Syriac studies are explored in more detail
                below. </p>
            <p xml:lang="en"> The fourth chapter (pp. 467–537), edited by Paola Buzi and Witold Witakowski,
                discusses the concept and practice of cataloguing manuscripts. A general history of
                the practice of cataloguing (4.1) is followed by a comparative history of
                cataloguing practices across eleven languages: Arabic, Armenian, Coptic, Ethiopic,
                Georgian, Greek, Hebrew, Persian, Slavonic, Syriac, and Turkish (4.2). The remaining
                four sections in this chapter offer a guide on practical matters related to
                producing catalogues and catalogue entries. Here the different types of catalogues
                (4.3), the syntactical description of manuscripts (4.4), the physical description of
                manuscripts (4.5), and digital practices of cataloguing (4.6) are covered.</p>
            <p xml:lang="en"> The fifth and final chapter (pp. 539–581), edited by Laura E. Parodi, turns to
                conservation and preservation of artefacts with special attention to ethical issues.
                After setting out the principles of conservation, the chapter offers concise
                summaries of different types of damage with recommendations for preservation,
                conservation, and digitization.</p>
            <p xml:lang="en"> Syriac studies are well-represented throughout the volume. Pier Giorgio Borbone and
                Françoise Briquel-Chatonnet offer a very brief overview of the Syriac manuscript
                tradition in the general introduction, highlighting dating, production, and current
                repositories (pp. 57–59). In the first chapter, Borbone, Briquel-Chatonnet, and Ewa
                Balicka-Witakowska summarize trends in the physical features of Syriac manuscripts
                and offer a guide for preparing codicological descriptions (pp. 252–266). In the
                second chapter, Andrea Schmidt surveys the history of Syriac palaeography and offers
                recommendations for describing palaeography in catalogue entries on manuscripts (pp.
                316–320). In the fourth chapter, André Binggeli provides a concise overview of
                Syriac catalogues and suggests standards for<pb n="431"/> producing syntactical descriptions of
                manuscripts (pp. 502–504). Contributions on neighboring areas of study, such as
                Arabic and Christian Palestinian Aramaic, will provide especially fruitful points of
                comparison. But Syriac materials are also placed into conversation with other
                traditions in less obvious places such as in Wido van Peursen’s discussion of
                linguistic features of sacred texts in Hebrew and related languages (p. 456).</p>
            <p xml:lang="en"> The third chapter on text editing includes two case studies related to Syriac.
                Grigory Kessel identifies a distinctive type of Syriac manuscript that transmits
                monastic literature, namely monastic miscellanies (pp. 411–414). Such miscellanies
                are attested in around 130 manuscripts and were produced by and circulated among
                Chalcedonian, Syrian Orthodox, and East Syriac communities. They have received very
                little attention in comparison to miscellanies in Latin, Greek, and western
                vernacular manuscripts. Kessel explores the challenges of producing critical
                editions based on texts found in monastic miscellanies in reference to two specific
                works: a text attributed to Thomas the Monk and a fragment of an anonymous
                commentary on Abba Isaiah’s <hi rend="italic">Asceticon</hi>. In another case study,
                Alessandro Mengozzi surveys the history of producing critical editions in Syriac
                (pp. 435–439). He highlights the influence of René Draguet who directed the Corpus
                Scriptorum Christianorum Orientalium (CSCO) series through much of the second half
                of the twentieth century. Draguet recommended a practice of representing the best
                manuscript and noting variants only in the apparatus rather than producing an
                eclectic text, a method that dominated editions in the CSCO until a change in
                leadership in 1995. Mengozzi highlights an alternative strategy for producing
                editions, exemplified by Sebastian Brock’s publication of Syriac dialogue poems.
                Rather than collecting these poems into a single volume, Brock published them in
                over twenty journals and edited volumes. These publications generally do not include
                critically edited texts but simply present the text on the basis of a selection of
                manuscripts and even printed books for a broad audience. Mengozzi sees Brock’s
                strategy as<pb n="432"/> an attractive alternative given publishing demands of contemporary
                universities. </p>
            <p xml:lang="en"> There are a couple of shortcomings in this useful volume. First, although Andrea
                Schmidt appropriately reminds readers that “[a]ccording to the modern standard it is
                now inappropriate to denote the scripts and vowel systems of the Western and Eastern
                Syriac traditions by the confessional terms ‘Jacobite’ and ‘Nestorian’ ” (p. 340),
                other entries in the volume do not exhibit such careful attention to terminology and
                indiscriminately use “Jacobite” and “Nestorian” to refer to Syriac confessional
                communities (pp. 109, 264).</p>
            <p xml:lang="en"> Second, there is at least one aspect of manuscript studies which the volume does not
                adequately cover. The third chapter features some of the most innovative and
                integrative aspects of the volume, as the case studies identify problems encountered
                while working on individual texts. Yet the introduction to this section explores
                traditional philological approaches to the editing of texts at the expense of
                “material” or “new philological” approaches (p. 321). While this decision may be
                justified on practical grounds, many of the case studies that follow draw on the
                resources of new philology. On the view of this reviewer, this represents a missed
                opportunity. Tensions between traditional philology and new philological approaches
                are evident in several manuscript cultures examined in this volume. A survey of this
                debate from a comparative perspective would have made a welcome addition. </p>
            <p xml:lang="en"> This volume will enable scholars to compare manuscript cultures, to gain from the
                perspectives of scholarship in other fields, and to work towards developing
                terminology and approaches that cross disciplines.</p><pb n="433"/>

            <anchor corresp="P1"/>[1] The
    section entitled <hi rend="italic">Social History of Formative Christianity
    and Judaism</hi> at the Annual Meeting of the Society of
    Biblical Literature (held in Atlanta, November 22-25, 2003,
    together with the Annual Meeting of the American Academy of
    Religion) was entirely devoted to ancient Syriac questions.
    From the chronological point of view the attention was mostly
    focused on the late second, the third and the fourth centuries;
    only one lecture dealt with fifth-century Syriac Christianity.
    The religious, cultural, historical and methodological interest
    of these papers seems altogether remarkable, so it will be
    useful to present in some extent the contents of each of
    them.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P2"/>[2] The
    first lecture was delivered by Stephen Lloyd-Moffett, of the
    University of California, Santa Barbara, who presented a
    reconsideration of "The 'Heresy' of Encratism and the History
    of Christianity in Eastern Syria". He observed that Encratism
    was a category created by Western church fathers, but never
    existed 'on the ground'. In fact, there were never
    self-professed Encratic leaders, Encratic doctrines or Encratic
    churches among the Christians of Eastern Syria. The radical
    ascetic orientation labelled by the Western authors as
    'Encratic' and initiated by Tatian was felt as normal Christian
    'orthopraxis' (rather than an 'orthodoxy') by the Syriac
    Christians, and represented the basis for Christian unity in
    the churches of Syria, not a cause of division. So
    Lloyd-Moffett argued that Syriac-church scholars ought to use
    categories indigenous to their context rather than others
    imported from the West.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P3"/>[3] Ute
    Possekel, of the St. John's Seminary of Boston, presented the
    second paper of the session: "Formative Christianity in Edessa:
    The Communal Structure of the Early Bardaisanites". It was a
    very rich study that explored the reasons of the success of
    Bardaisan's community, one of the earliest Christian
    communities of Edessa, flourished until at least the early
    fifth century, even if it soon came to be labelled as
    heretical. Possekel depicted the extraordinary intellectual
    figure of Bardaisan with his interests in Greek philosophy,
    Christian beliefs, astrology, geography, ethnography, science,
    and presented the sources that we have at our disposal for the
    study of his thought: the <hi rend="italic">Book of the Laws of the
    Countries</hi>, written by a disciple, the Adamantius dialogue,
    the works of St. Ephrem and several heresiological accounts:
    Bardaisan's own writings are now lost. The paper analysed the
    communal structure of the Bardaisanites and its influence on
    Edessan society and concluded that some aspects of the
    community's social structure, above all the provenance of many
    members from the local aristocracy, together with some elements
    of Bardaisan's teaching, especially his synthesis between
    astrology (that interested the upper classes in Edessa) and the
    doctrine of free will, considerably contributed to the
    Bardaisanite movement.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P4"/>[4] Tina
    Shepardson, of the University of Tennessee, who has devoted
    several works to St. Ephrem, in the third paper dealt with this
    author's polemics: "Interpret with Care: Jews, Arians, 'Jews'
    and 'Arians' in Fourth-century Syria". She focused the
    attention on Ephrems' anti-Jewish language, used by him to warn
    his audience away from both real Jewish festivals and from the
    allegedly "Jewish" Christology of subordinationist Christians:
    so, from "Arian" Christianity, in opposition to Nicene
    Christianity. In order to explore who these "Jews" and these
    "Arians" were, Shepardson made a distinction between their
    historical reality and Ephrem's rhetoric, and placed this
    rhetoric alongside the location of the Syrian father in
    fourth-century Nisibis and Edessa. This helps to throw some
    light on the nature of Christianity in these towns.</p>

    Alexander Mirkovic, of the University of South Florida, who is
    preparing a book on the <hi rend="italic">Doctrina Addai</hi>, dealt with
    this subject also in the fourth paper of the session:
    "Political Rhetoric of Labubna" (Labubna is the supposed author
    of the <hi rend="italic">Teaching of Addai</hi>). On the basis of the words,
    images and social relations depicted in this Syriac document,
    which describes the conversion of the Edessan king Abgar by the
    apostle Addai, sent to the region of Northern Mesopotamia
    directly by St. Thomas, one of the twelve apostles, Mirkovic
    convincingly demonstrated that Labubna's fiction was written in
    the fourth century. It reflects an important phase in the
    process of Romanization and Christianization of the Syrian
    aristocracy: for this reason Addai's mission is directed only
    to the members of the Edessan aristocracy and to the king
    himself, who in the <hi rend="italic">Teaching</hi> looks more like a Roman
    governor than a ruler of an independent kingdom. In fact,
    Labubna seems to call his community to participate in the new
    Roman order of the emperor Constantine.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P6"/>[6] Lucas
    Van Rompay, of Duke University, presented a paper on "Syrian
    Christianity in the Age of Justinian: Continuity and
    Redefinition", dedicated to the anti-Chalcedonian Miaphysite
    church in Syria during the sixth century. The nascent
    Syrian-Orthodox church was still part of the Roman Empire, yet
    disconnected from the imperial church, and so it needed a
    redefinition of its identity. This redefinition was explored by
    the author in the paper with particular attention to its
    literary, cultural and social aspects. The landscape carefully
    depicted in detail is broad and Van Rompay does not see the
    creation of Syrian-Orthodox church as a local phenomenon, but
    rather puts it in the international context of the
    anti-Chalcedonian movement, with ramifications in Egypt,
    Ethiopia, Arabia, Armenia and in the Sassanid Empire.</p>

         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P1"/>[1] The book
    under review is a survey of the most important chronicles
    written in Syriac and Christian Arabic, meant to introduce the
    general public to this very important literary genre. The book
    is divided into three major sections. The first section deals
    with the <hi rend="italic">Chronicle of Edessa</hi> and the short <hi rend="italic">Chronicle
    of Joshua the Stylite;</hi> both are early documents dated to
    the 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi> century. The second section deals with West
    Syriac “Jacobite” chronicles, beginning with the
    ecclesiastical History of John of Asia (or of Ephesus), though
    this is not technically a chronicle. Several pages are devoted
    to the chronicle of Pseudo-Dionysius of Tell-Mahre, the
    monumental Chronicle of Patriarch Michael the Syrian, the
    Chronicle to the year 1234, and the Chronography of
    Bar-Hebraeus. The third and last section surveys the Arabic
    <hi rend="italic">Chronicle of Seert</hi>, the opus of Elijah of Nisibis,
    <hi rend="italic">Kitāb al-Majdal</hi> (“Book of the Tower”)
    of Mārī son of Sulaimān, and the <hi rend="italic">Book of
    Mysteries</hi> of Slīwā son of Yō<hi rend="u">h</hi>annā. A conclusion, chronological lists, maps
    and indexes end the book.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P2"/>[2] The
    value of the book resides in the translation of often lengthy
    extracts from the chronicles selected by the author for his
    biographical, literary and historical analyses. The
    translations are generally reliable and enjoyable to read
    thanks to Dr. Yousif’s mastery of both Syriac and French.
    In each chronicle or ecclesiastical history Yousif opts for the
    most important passages to translate, such as those dealing
    with the Crusades for Michael the Syrian and the Mongols for
    Bar-Hebraeus, so as to stress the contribution of Syriac
    Chronicles to world history. The translated passages are always
    accompanied by commentaries written in a simple but vivid
    language, to help the reader understand the events discussed by
    the original sources. The author ends the presentation of each
    chronicle with comments on its author, the latter’s
    writing style, concept of history and aims in writing. He
    justifies the shortcomings of the chronicles by saying that
    they were written in specific contexts and for different
    audiences. Thus, the lack of objectivity of Bar-Hebraeus when
    talking about the Mongols is explained with reference to the
    danger of openly criticizing the chronicler’s uneasy
    masters (p. 275).</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P3"/>[3] Since
    the book is written for public readership with no background in
    the subject, Yousif surveys the historiographical tradition in
    ancient Mesopotamia and the classical world at the beginning of
    the book. He shows that the interest of Syriac-speaking culture
    in recording history was not a novelty but rather a
    continuation of earlier cultural and scientific trends. Here
    one might note that in Assyria the practice of writing annals
    did not start with Tiglath-pileser I (p. 12) but at least two
    centuries before him, at the beginning of the Middle Assyrian
    period (middle of the 14<hi rend="sup">th</hi> century). While the list
    of Greek historians and early Christian chronographers and
    ecclesiastical historians is useful and telling (pp. 14-20),
    one should add that Syriac chronography as a literary genre is
    greatly indebted to the Chronicle of Eusebius of Caesarea.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P4"/>[4] The
    Chronicle of Joshua the Stylite, though the shortest among the
    known Syriac chronicles, is dealt with at length (pp. 37-58)
    because of its early date. Several passages are translated on
    the basis of William Wright’s 1882 edition, though
    Chabot’s edition of the 1940s is not only more recent but
    also more reliable than that of Wright. The palimpsest
    manuscript does not show Coptic (p. 37) but Greek (p. 95)
    underwriting, more precisely the Septuagint studied in great
    detail by Eugene Tisserant, <hi rend="italic">Codex Zuqninensis rescriptus
    Veteris Testamenti</hi> (Rome 1911). Recent studies have shown
    that Joshua the Stylite was probably not the author of this
    chronicle but the compiler and author of the last part of the
    <hi rend="italic">Codex zuqninensis</hi> (see below).</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P5"/>[5] The
    second and largest section of the book (pp. 59-276) discusses
    the Ecclesiastical History of John of Ephesus and four major
    chronicles produced by West Syriac writers. Yousif is right to
    include the history of John of Ephesus, despite the fact that
    this is not a chronicle as such. John’s influence on
    Syriac chronography as evidenced in the so-called Chronicle of
    Pseudo-Dionysius of Tell-Mahre was great, both in terms of
    content and of style. The survey of this ecclesiastical history
    includes a useful study of the time of Justinian. Yousif always
    highlights the ethnic and linguistic awareness of the Syriac
    writers whenever it is clearly expressed in their writings, and
    dealing with John of Ephesus, he notes the author’s
    insistence on writing in Syriac though he knew Latin and Greek
    (p. 93).</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P6"/>[6] Although
    Yousif knows that modern scholarship prefers the title
    “Chronicle of Zuqnīn” rather than the
    “Chronicle of Pseudo-Dionysius of Tell-Mahre” in
    reference to <hi rend="italic">Codex Zuqninensis</hi>, he opts for the latter.
    I have made it amply clear that the author of this <hi rend="italic">Codex</hi>
    may well have been Joshua the Stylite, and that the manuscript
    is not a 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi> century copy of an original (p. 95) but
    an autographon on the basis of the physical shape of the codex
    and the textual evidence inside it (A. Harrak, <hi rend="italic">The Chronicle
    of Zuqnīn</hi>, Toronto, 1999). Most of Yousif’s
    discussion deals with the early Abbasid period in which the
    chronicler lived. It is true that the Chronicle of Zuqnīn
    is universal, but one must admit that Part IV, a major portion
    of this monumental source, is a “local chronicle”
    concentrating on the economic policy of the early Abbasids in
    the Jazīra (Upper Syria). This part of the Chronicle is
    similar in genre to other “local” chronicles and
    histories dated to the medieval period, such as
    <hi rend="italic">Tārīkh al-Maw<hi rend="u">s</hi>il</hi>
    “History of Mosul” of al-Azdī (9<hi rend="sup">th</hi>
    century), “History of <hi rend="u">T</hi>abaristān,” “History of
    Sijistān,” etc.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P7"/>[7] While
    discussing the Chronicle to the year 1234 and the massive
    Chronicle of Michael the Syrian, Yousif rightly notes the
    indebtedness of both chronicles to the 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi> century
    Patriarch Dionysius of Tell-Mahre, the most outstanding among
    all Syriac chroniclers. Because of the importance of this
    author and his role in perfecting Syriac chronography, one
    would have liked an independent study of this author. Andrew
    Palmer had already paved the way to such a discussion in
    reconstructing his chronicle as far as the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi>
    century is concerned, and concomitantly in stressing the
    erudition of Patriarch Dionysius in Syriac chronography (A.
    Palmer, <hi rend="italic">The Seventh Century in the West-Syrian
    Chronicles</hi>, Liverpool 1993).</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P8"/>[8] The last
    part of the book is devoted to East Syriac
    “Nestorian” authors (pp. 279-420), and here the
    author surveys the sources, translates them and comments on
    them as he did for the other chronicles and histories. The
    Chronicle of Seert published in <hi rend="italic">Patrologia Orientalis</hi>
    between 1907 and 1918 is discussed at great length (279-344).
    This is a very important source for East Syriac Christianity
    that makes use of some no longer available chronicles listed by
    Yousif (p. 280). The latter noticed the important gap found at
    the beginning of this chronicle that must have contained the
    events of the first two centuries and part of the third century
    of the Christian era. Even the mutilated second part of the
    chronicle misses events that took place between 422 and 484.
    Unfortunately, Yousif does not take into account an Arabic
    “History of the Church” that may fill the gaps of
    the Chronicle of Seert. The <hi rend="italic">editio princeps</hi> of this
    chronicle was published by Bu<hi rend="u">t</hi>rus
    <hi rend="u">H</hi>addād, <hi rend="italic">Mukhta<hi rend="u">s</hi>ar al-Akhbār
    al-Bī<hi rend="sup">
                  <hi rend="italic">c</hi>
               </hi>iyya</hi> (Brief Ecclesiastical
    Chronicle), Baghdad 2000, but the original was copied in the
    year 531 of Hegira which corresponds to AD 1137. The
    writer’s name is deleted but we know from the contents of
    this source that he resided in Baghdad during the latter part
    of the 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi> century and that he was a member of the
    church of the East. In a private correspondence with
    <hi rend="u">H</hi>addād dated to 1988, the late
    Father J-M. Fiey did not believe that this history was part of
    the chronicle of Seert, though he stressed its importance as a
    literary source dealing with the early history of the Church of
    the East. By contrast, the editor and publisher of the
    “new” chronicle was greatly convinced that it may
    well have been the missing part of the Seert Chronicle; see B.
    Haddad in <hi rend="italic">Actes du deuxième congrès
    internationale d’études arabes
    chrétiennes</hi>, Orientalia Christiana Analecta 226
    (Rome 1986) pp. 207-210. If Yousif had included the
    “Brief Ecclesiastical Chronicle” in his book, he
    could have updated his discussion about the Chronicle of Seert.
    Even if we assume that there is no relation between the two
    chronicles, discussing it in detail could have added value to
    the last section of the book under review since chronicles and
    church histories written by East Syriac authors are not
    numerous.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P9"/>[9] The
    above comments are not meant to undermine Dr. Yousif’s
    book. He has, in fact, produced an excellent tool for the study
    of Syriac literature and ancient and medieval historiography.
    The tool is particularly useful for students and the lay public
    who are not versed in the Syriac language and literature. Even
    scholars in this field can benefit from its lengthy
    translations, in addition to the comments coming from the pen
    of an author who not only knows Syriac well but is also a
    member of the Syriac-speaking community.</p>

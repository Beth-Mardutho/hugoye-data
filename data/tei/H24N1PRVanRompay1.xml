                <p xml:lang="en">This momentous monograph on Dionysius bar Ṣalibi (d. 1171), one
                    of the main authorities of the Syriac Orthodox tradition, consists of three
                    parts, each with its own distinctive content and qualities. The first part
                    (pp. 5–75) offers a detailed biography and a survey of the works of Bar
                    Ṣalibi. The second and central part (pp. 77–295) focuses on his <hi
                        rend="italic">Commentary on the Epistle to the Romans</hi>. The third
                    part (pp. 297–470) presents itself as an appendix with five components: 1. a
                    detailed catalogue of all the known manuscripts of Bar Ṣalibi’s works,
                    published and unpublished, several of them previously unknown (pp. 299–448);
                    2. an edition and translation of an anonymous Syriac testimony on the life
                    and works of Bar Ṣalibi, written a few years after his death (pp. 449–454);
                    3. an edition and translation of Bar Ṣalibi’s “Creed of the Suryoye” (pp.
                    455–460); 4. sample photographs of the five manuscripts underlying the
                    edition of the <hi rend="italic">Commentary on Romans</hi> (pp. 461–466); 5.
                    photographs of the Mother of God cathedral in the city of Amid (Turkish:
                    Diyarbakır) and of Bar Ṣalibi’s tomb therein (pp. 467–470). The book
                    concludes with the list of the manuscripts referenced throughout the
                    monograph (pp. 471–473), the biblio-graphy (pp. 474–490), and an index of
                    names and places (pp. 491–503).</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">The overview of Bar Ṣalibi’s life and works in the
                    first part of the book is richer and more detailed than anything published
                    so far. The author relies, among other things, on colophons and notes in
                    manuscripts, many of which previous scholars have not used. Several short
                    pieces are edited here, in addition to the one longer text, written by a
                    younger contemporary, that is edited in the Appendix (pp. 449–454). Basing
                    himself on these new materials, the author is able, among other things, to
                    confirm the year 1148 as the date of Bar Ṣalibi’s consecration as bishop of
                    Marʿaš, or Germanicia (from which he later moved to Amid), and to adduce
                    additional information on Bar Ṣalibi’s relationship to Michael Rabo
                    (patriarch from 1166 to 1199), for whom he served as a mentor. Bar Ṣalibi’s
                    edited works are listed, with full references to the manuscripts as well as
                    to existing editions and translations in Arabic, Armenian, and European
                    languages.</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">The main part of the book provides the first edition of
                    Bar Ṣalibi’s <hi rend="italic">Commentary on Romans</hi>. The edition is
                    preceded by a description of the manuscripts used. Out of the 21 existing
                    manuscripts, six were selected for the edition: A = Mosul, Syriac Orthodox
                    Archdiocese, 6 (between 1222 and 1234); B = Mardin, 107 (13th cent.); C =
                    London, British Library, Add. 7185 (around 1200?); D = Berlin, 181/Sachau
                    238 (14th cent.?); E = Oxford, Bodleian Library, Or. 560 (before 1524); F =
                    Manchester, John Rylands Library, Syr. 35 (1904). The author describes each
                    of these manuscripts at great length, including all available information on
                    the scribe and the place and date of origin, and reflections on the <hi
                        rend="italic">Vorlage</hi>. He also provides editions of colophons and
                    additional notes, along with translations. Here again the author shows his
                    skills in Syriac codicology and paleography, his familiarity with manuscript
                    collections in the Middle East and in the diaspora communities in Europe,
                    his overall knowledge of Syriac literary culture, and his attention to
                    detail. With regard to mss. A, B, and C, he speculates that they may have
                    been copied from Bar Ṣalibi’s autograph, which is not preserved, but a
                    sister manuscript of which (containing Bar Ṣalibi’s commentary on the four
                    Gospels) may survive in ms. Damascus, Syriac Orthodox Patriarchate, 2/7, in
                    which Patriarch Barsoum already recognized Bar Ṣalibi’s hand (see esp. pp.
                    95–96, 116, and 132).</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">Ms. A constitutes the base manuscript for the edition.
                    The variants of all the other manuscripts are given in the apparatus, which
                    is very exhaustive and also includes spelling variants, dots, corrections,
                    etc. Occasionally it is not the A reading that is reproduced in the main
                    text, but a variant taken from one or more other manuscripts. This is
                    understandable in the case of an obvious scribal error. In other cases,
                    however, the author’s rationale is less clear and remains unexplained. In
                    the translation, one occasionally notices that a variant from the apparatus
                    is prioritized over the A reading, without further explanation: e.g., Rom.
                    6:2, where the translation “er flüchtet” (p. 247) reflects the reading of B
                    (<foreign xml:lang="syr">ܘܥ̇ܪܩ</foreign>) rather than the reading of A
                    and the majority of the manuscripts (<foreign xml:lang="syr">ܘܦܪܩ</foreign>
                    “he goes away”). Overall, the notes to the translation very rarely refer to
                    variant readings. The different meaning of a variant is reported only
                    rarely; when a variant has a longer text or includes an additional comment,
                    these are ignored in the translation (e.g., Rom. 2:23, p. 163, note 32).
                    Thanks to the author’s exceptional generosity in composing the Syriac
                    apparatus, an attentive reader will be able to figure out an answer to the
                    questions she or he may have, but a more transparent approach would have
                    been welcome. </p>
                <p xml:lang="en">The author’s German translation is deliberately very
                    close to the Syriac text. Throughout his commentary, Bar Ṣalibi quotes only
                    the initial words of each biblical verse and proceeds with short sentences,
                    which sometimes seem disconnected and may have been taken from different
                    sources. One occasionally is tempted to connect the short pieces and
                    construe larger sentences. The author mostly resists this temptation and
                    respects Bar Ṣalibi’s style, which he characterizes as less enthusiastic and
                    less accomplished than the style in his commentaries on the Gospels –
                    perhaps due to the fact that Bar Ṣalibi had to write the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Commentary on Romans</hi> under the weight of his office (“unter der
                    Last seines Amtes,” p. 295). The author’s decision, therefore, to limit
                    himself to minimal interventions (such as completing the biblical verses or
                    parts thereof) seems justified. At the same time, the reader feels invited
                    to participate in the interactive process of interpretation. </p>
                <p xml:lang="en">Bar Ṣalibi’s <hi rend="italic">Commentary on
                    Romans</hi> is an outstanding piece of exegesis in the Syriac Orthodox
                    tradition. Its inspiration comes largely from John Chrysostom and Mushe bar
                    Kipho (d. 903). The author mentions both names on each page of his
                    translation, referring to J. Jatsch’s German translation (1923) of
                    Chrysostom’s Greek text, and to J. Reller’s Syriac edition of Mushe’s
                    commentary (1994). It would be important to ascertain whether Bar Ṣalibi
                    used the early Syriac translation of Chrysostom’s commentary, the same
                    version to which Mushe had access. This early translation is imperfectly
                    known. To the witnesses mentioned on p. 145, note 294, one should add ms.
                    Deir al-Surian 19, which is the second half of a once two-volume manuscript
                    (6th or 7th cent.), containing homilies 15 to 32, which cover Romans 8 to
                    16; see S. P. Brock and L. Van Rompay,
                    <hi rend="italic">Catalogue of the Syriac Manuscripts and Fragments in the Library of Deir al-Surian </hi>(2014),
                    pp. 95–100. </p>
                <p xml:lang="en">As a likely third source, less significant than the
                    other two, the author mentions Ishoʿdad of Merv (fl. 850), who wrote a
                    complete commentary on the Bible. Several notes to the translation refer to
                    interpretations or expressions that Bar Ṣalibi shares with Ishoʿdad, which
                    is all the more interesting, since Ishoʿdad belongs to the East Syriac
                    tradition, for which Theodore of Mopsuestia is the leading authority. In one
                    passage, <hi rend="italic">ad</hi> Rom. 6:5, the author points to Theodore
                    as the ultimate source of an interpretation that Bar Ṣalibi and Ishoʿdad
                    share (p. 248, note 184). He does not mention, however, that here Bar Ṣalibi
                    follows Theodore much more closely than Ishoʿdad does, which rules out the
                    possibility that Ishoʿdad was Bar Ṣalibi’s source. (Bar Ṣalibi: “For plants
                    also die and are destroyed when they are planted, and then they sprout and
                    are changed to something better than the first (condition)” [p. 177,12–13] =
                    Theodore: <foreign xml:lang="gr">ἐπειδὴ καὶ τῶν φυτῶν ἴδιόν ἐστι τὸ νεκροῦσθαι μὲν ἐν τῇ φυτείᾳ,
                    μεθίστασθαι δὲ ἐπὶ τὸ κρεῖττον ... πολλῷ</foreign> [K. Staab, <hi rend="italic"

                <p xml:lang="en">Evidence of Bar Ṣalibi’s access to (parts of)
                    Theodore’s <hi rend="italic">Commentary on Romans</hi> (which in Greek is
                    known only in a number of isolated fragments), beyond what was available to
                    him in Ishoʿdad, may be found in Bar Ṣalibi’s not infrequent use of the
                    concept of <foreign xml:lang="syr">ܡܨܛܠܝܢܘܬܐ</foreign> “inclination (mostly
                    toward sin).” This is commonly used in the Syriac Theodore tradition,
                    rendering ῥοπή “propensity,” sometimes in combination with εὐκολία “ease, or
                    facility (in doing evil).” For example in Rom. 6:13, Christians are
                    encouraged “to offer the members of their bodies as instruments of
                    righteousness to God,” which for both Bar Ṣalibi and Theodore implies
                    neutralizing the evil influence of “the inclination toward sin and its
                    movements” (Bar Ṣalibi: “the movement/stirring of the inclination toward
                    sin” [p. 178:27: <foreign xml:lang="syr">ܠܙܘܥܐ ܕܡܨܛܠܝܢܘܬܐ ܕܠܘܬ
                        ܚܛܝܬܐ</foreign> ]; Theodore: <foreign xml:lang="gr">τὴν περὶ τὸ ἁμαρτάνειν ῥοπὴν καὶ τὰς

                <p xml:lang="en">Bar Ṣalibi’s likely familiarity with (isolated pieces
                    of) Theodore’s exegesis has its precedents in the Syriac Orthodox tradition,
                    in particular in Mushe bar Kipho and in Lazarus of Beth Qandasa (probably
                    9th cent.). The latter, whom the author briefly discusses on p. 142, note
                    283, had access to the Syriac translation of some of Theodore’s writings
                    (see my article in <hi rend="italic">Parole de l’Orient</hi> 45 [2019], pp.
                    363–392) and was the author of a <hi rend="italic">Commentary on
                        Romans</hi>, of which perhaps a tiny piece survives in a Deir al-Surian
                    fragment, see Brock and Van Rompay, <hi rend="italic">Catalogue</hi>, pp.
                    465–466 (Fragment 177).</p>
                <p xml:lang="en">With this impeccable text edition and annotated
                    translation, accompanied by much-needed discussions of many aspects of Bar
                    Ṣalibi’s legacy, the author has laid a robust foundation for all future
                    research on this important scholar and leader of the Syriac Orthodox church.
                    Particularly in his analysis of the manuscripts and in his many precious
                    comments on textual details and historical content, the author brings
                    together the worlds of Syriac Christian and Western scholarship, two worlds
                    which in an impressive way converge and enrich each other in his work. He
                    deserves the congratulations and profound thanks of all Syriac scholars.</p>

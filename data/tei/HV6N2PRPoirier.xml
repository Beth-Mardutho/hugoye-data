         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P1"/>[1] Shortly
    after the discovery of the Coptic <hi rend="italic">Gospel of Thomas</hi> (NHC
    II, 2; hereafter GT), many scholars—for example, H.-Ch.
    Puech, G. Garitte, A. Guillaumont, and G. Quispel—drew
    attention to the fact that the text of the new gospel contained
    a certain number of expressions or syntactical constructions
    which could be labelled as semiticisms. This observation among
    others contributed significantly to the ascription of GT to an
    Aramaic, i.e., Syriac or Edessene, milieu. Drawing on G.
    Quispel's and T. Baarda's work, Nicholas Perrin's monograph
    pursues a triple objective: it seeks to establish (1) that GT
    was originally composed in Syriac, (2) that this Syriac text
    forms a unity and not a random collection of sayings, and (3)
    that the author of GT relied on written Syriac gospel sources,
    among them, Tatian's <hi rend="italic">Diatessaron</hi>. This assumption
    implies that GT be assigned a relatively late date of
    redaction, since it is generally agreed that the
    <hi rend="italic">Diatessaron</hi> was composed sometime after 170 C.E.
    Therefore Perrin's thesis takes the opposite course to that of
    a significant part of GT scholarship, which dates the gospel to
    the beginning of the 2<hi rend="sup">nd</hi> century, if not
    earlier.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P2"/>[2] This
    monograph originates from a Ph.D. dissertation submitted at
    Marquette University under the supervision of Prof. Julian
    Hill. It opens with an expanded introduction which presents
    "Thomas among the Gospels". In this introduction, Perrin
    discusses the main literary and historical issues that have
    monopolized the attention of GT scholars: the relationship of
    the Coptic gospel to the Synoptic Gospels, its provenance and
    date, its original language of composition, its theology, genre
    and purpose, and its sources. At the end of the review, Perrin
    comes to the conclusion that "Thomasine scholarship has settled
    into two entrenched camps," some scholars maintaining "that GT
    is a re-editing of the canonical gospel tradition," while
    "others hold fast to their insistence that the collection is
    independent of the synoptic tradition" (14). In reaction to
    what he sees as a deadlock, Perrin proposes to "reframe the
    question" by asking whether there is not a third possibility.
    This third possibility would be "that GT is neither independent
    of nor directly dependent on the Greek synoptic gospels; rather
    the literary relationship between Thomas and the canonical
    gospels can best be described as one of <hi rend="italic">indirect</hi>
    dependence" (15). As to the actual link between the canonical
    gospels and GT, Perrin thinks that, "if Thomas was influenced
    by Matthew, Mark, Luke (and John), it is only as the latter are
    mediated through the first Syriac gospel record: Tatian's
    <hi rend="italic">Diatessaron</hi>" (<hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>.).</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P3"/>[3] Perrin's
    proposal is unquestionably clear; it is also a daring one. The
    reader is then all the more eager to see how he will make his
    point. The author's demonstration is offered in three chapters.
    The first one, "A Syriac <hi rend="italic">Gospel of Thomas</hi>?", begins with
    stating the three conditions under which it could be suggested
    that Thomas knew and used the <hi rend="italic">Diatessaron</hi>: (1) GT has to
    be of Syriac provenance, (2) it was written in Syriac, and (3)
    it was written after 173 C.E. (the received dating for the
    <hi rend="italic">Diatessaron</hi>). These propositions lead to a late date for
    GT's composition, which contradicts "the unexamined assumption"
    of Thomas studies (24), that it was penned around 140 C.E. In
    order to establish that GT was influenced by Tatian's harmony
    gospel and "that the Thomasine collection is to be understood
    not as a string of Greek logia randomly compiled through many
    stages, but as a unified Syriac text carefully worded and
    arranged so as to conform to a certain literary-rhetorical
    pattern," as a "tightly woven Syriac text" (25), the issue of
    the original language of GT must be settled. There are, at
    least theoretically, three possibilities: Coptic, Greek, and
    Syriac, which Perrin presents while asking what each of them
    means for the dependence of GT on the Syriac
    <hi rend="italic">Diatessaron</hi>. Considering that the Greek fragments of GT
    (P. Oxy 1, 654, and 655) are dated around 200 C.E., which
    leaves a maximum of 25 years between the redaction of the
    <hi rend="italic">Diatessaron</hi> and the composition of GT, a most direct
    road from the former to the latter is needed, which practically
    excludes Greek—not to speak of Coptic—and leaves
    only Syriac as a viable option. After a review of evidence for
    a Syriac GT in the form of a <hi rend="italic">Status quaestionis</hi>, and
    some observations on possible syriacisms in GT 9, 33, and 41,
    Perrin concludes that "it must now be recognized that at least
    a fair number of logia do show signs of having been composed
    either in western Aramaic or Syriac" (46). As for whether this
    specific context was Syriac rather than western Aramaic, Perrin
    favours Syriac for two reasons. Firstly, by a process of
    elimination, in view of the fact that "clear and unequivocal
    evidence for a western Aramaic (and only western Aramaic)
    background is simply lacking" (<hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>.). Secondly,
    "whereas the Aramaic theory certainly has the potential to
    explain some of the semiticisms in GT, the strength of the
    Syriac theory lies in its ability to explain them all"
    (<hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>.).</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P4"/>[4] In the
    second chapter, Perrin seeks "to put the theory to the test by
    introducing a new kind of analysis: a linguistic analysis
    involving catchwords" (49). Catchwords are defined as "any word
    which can be semantically, etymologically, or phonologically
    associated with another word found in an adjacent logion" (50).
    The choice of catchwords is based on the assumption that where
    there appears to be the convergence of a word-sound and a
    word-meaning within two juxtaposed logia, then these logia must
    be considered as joined. Furthermore, to focus solely on
    catchwords provides a measurable standard of comparison, and a
    valuable one, since catchwords were "undoubtedly an important
    feature at some level of redaction in GT" (53). The following
    one-hundred pages of chapter 2 are devoted to "a comparison of
    catchwords occurring in Coptic, Greek, and Syriac," presented
    as a four column synopsis (the author's English translation of
    GT; Coptic [NHC II, 2]; Greek [reconstructed except when the P.
    Oxy are extant]; Syriac [reconstructed]). While the English
    column presents the entire text of GT, the three other columns
    give only those words which qualify as catchwords. A system of
    arrows in the English translation indicates whether a catchword
    links a logion with the previous or the following logion, or
    with both. In the end, it appears that 502 catchwords are
    retrievable in Syriac as compared to 263 in Greek and 269 in
    the extant Coptic text. Consequently, "the quantitative
    evidence points decisively in the direction of Syriac
    composition" and "suggest a single linguistic background for
    the entire collection" (156). In Perrin's eyes, this cumulative
    evidence confirms the "Syriac theory" beyond reasonable doubt:
    "GT was composed entirely in Syriac" (169).</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P5"/>[5] With the
    third chapter, "<hi rend="italic">Thomas</hi> and His Sources", Perrin comes to
    his "final concern": to demonstrate Thomas's dependence upon
    the <hi rend="italic">Diatessaron</hi>. His demonstration proceeds in three
    stages. Firstly, given the document's organic unity exemplified
    by its pervasive recourse to catchwords, it is to be inferred
    that the collection was written by one author at one time.
    Secondly, his sources must have been written instead of oral.
    Thirdly, these written sources were in Syriac and included
    materials from the synoptic tradition as well as from the
    <hi rend="italic">Diatessaron</hi>.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P6"/>[6] The
    final conclusion restates the main results of the study, first,
    that Thomas is dependent upon the <hi rend="italic">Diatessaron</hi>, second,
    that Tatian and the author of GT belonged to the same world,
    the world of Edessene Christianity, and third, that "GT is to
    be read as an esoteric Syriac collection in which the hearer's
    ability to distinguish wordplay figures prominently" (192). In
    his use of authoritative texts, Thomas is indebted to "a broad
    exegetical tradition within Judaism and early Christianity"
    (195) of which the closest analogy lies perhaps in the Qumran
    material. The means by which this exegetical tradition came to
    Thomas remains, however, a question still to be answered. The
    book ends with the wish that "the placement of Thomas's gospel
    within the milieu of early Syriac Christianity will prove to be
    (the) much needed new beginning" (196) for the study of GT.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P7"/>[7] Perrin's
    monograph is undeniably a detailed and sophisticated study of
    GT, and it is impossible within the context of this review to
    discuss the value of his reconstruction of the Syriac
    background of the Coptic gospel. I will therefore limit myself
    to a few general remarks. First of all, it must be said that
    this book is a very valuable contribution to the elucidation of
    the unmistakable Semitic, i.e., Aramaic or Syriac, character of
    GT. Perrin has added a number of important pieces of evidence
    pointing towards a Syriac original to those already collected
    by Guillaumont and others. His demonstration, however, is far
    from being the best way to establish that GT was composed in
    Syriac. The main difficulty with such a proof lies in the fact
    that we have absolutely no evidence of Syriac literary texts
    prior to the Bardesanian <hi rend="italic">Book of the Laws of Countries</hi>
    (end of 2<hi rend="sup">nd</hi> - beginning of 3<hi rend="sup">rd</hi> century).
    As to Tatian's <hi rend="italic">Diatessaron</hi>, if it was composed in
    Syriac—which seems to be, if not the reality, at least
    the <hi rend="italic">opinio communis</hi>—, it can be reconstructed only
    indirectly. On the other hand, our knowledge of Aramaic-western
    or eastern- for the first two centuries of the Common Era is
    scarcely better than that of Syriac. Nevertheless, the fact
    that Syriac was practically standardized by the beginning of
    the 2<hi rend="sup">nd</hi> century, if not earlier, argues in favour of
    its use as a bench mark for the quest for the original language
    of GT. My second remark concerns Perrin's main thesis, namely,
    that the author/redactor of GT relied upon Tatian's
    <hi rend="italic">Diatessaron</hi>. Let's say from the start that Perrin's
    conclusion is a default one. To put it in his own words, "since
    Tatian's harmony was presumably the only gospel record
    available in the Syriac language at that time, the evidence
    points ineluctably to Diatessaronic influence" (17; see also
    193: "Tatian's <hi rend="italic">Diatessaron</hi> is the only Syriac text of
    the Synoptic tradition that could have been available to
    Thomas"). In order to validate this <hi rend="italic">post hoc propter hoc</hi>
    argument, a side-by-side comparison of the Coptic GT and its
    Syriac retroversion with the actual text of the
    <hi rend="italic">Diatessaron</hi>—provided that it can be reconstructed
    with some certainty—would be necessary. Paradoxically,
    however, Tatian (and his <hi rend="italic">Diatessaron</hi>) is the most
    noticeable absentee from this book. Perrin's endeavour has made
    out <hi rend="italic">his</hi> case for a Tatianic dependence but <hi rend="italic">the</hi>
    case still has to be tried. There is no doubt that the
    discussion resulting from his study will provoke will help
    clarifying the matter. Whatever the issue, Dr. Perrin has made
    a noteworthy contribution to the study of GT and its
    Aramaic/Syriac background.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P8"/>[8] It is
    not easy to produce such a technical book without any flaws. I
    mention only those which affect Syriac words. P. 38,
    2<hi rend="sup">nd</hi> line of the Syriac quotation: read
    <hi rend="italic">tšbhwn</hi>; p. 44, paenult. and ult. lin.: read

    Syriac phrase; p. 67, n. 40, "from us" is never <hi rend="italic">man</hi> but
    <hi rend="italic">menan</hi>; p. 96, n. 121: read <hi rend="italic">npq</hi> (twice); p. 118,

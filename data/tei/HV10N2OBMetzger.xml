         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P1"/>[1] Dr.
    Bruce Manning Metzger, New Testament professor emeritus at
    Princeton Theological Seminary and, I believe, the greatest
    American New Testament critic and biblical translator of the
    twentieth century, died February 13, 2007, at his home in
    Princeton at the age of 93.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P2"/>[2] Bruce
    Metzger was born in Middletown, Pennsylvania on the
    9<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of February 1914. After gaining a BA from
    Lebanon Valley College in 1935, he entered Princeton
    Theological Seminary, graduating with a ThB in 1938. So began a
    life-long association with Princeton Theological Seminary
    during which Bruce Metzger became not only a legend himself but
    also one of the school’s greatest intellectual ornaments.
    He was ordained in the United Presbyterian Church (now the
    PC[USA]) in 1939. In 1944 he married Isobel Elizabeth, the
    elder daughter of John Alexander Mackay, the great Third
    President of the Seminary, who rebuilt and revitalized the
    school after the divisions of the 1920s. Bruce Metzger’s
    sheer brilliance, clarity and Christian devotion set a standard
    all of his own. He taught while he continued to study
    (Princeton University, MA[1940], Ph.D. [1942], Classics),
    serving as Teaching Fellow in New Testament Greek 1938-40 and
    as Instructor in New Testament 1940-44. He was appointed
    Assistant Professor 1944-48; Associate Professor 1948-54 and
    Professor 1954-84. He was named the George L. Collord Professor
    of New Testament Language and Literature in 1964. He retired in
    1984 and was named professor emeritus.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P3"/>[3] An
    absolutely preeminent New Testament scholar, Metzger was known
    internationally for his work in biblical translation and the
    history of the Bible’s versions and canonization. He was
    one of the world leaders in textual study of the New Testament,
    the Apocrypha and the Pseudepigrapha. He served as Chair of the
    Committee on Translation of the American Bible Society 1964-70,
    and as Chair of the Committee of Translators for the <hi rend="italic">New
    Revised Standard Version of the Bible</hi> 1977-90. The impact
    of this work is incalculable and Bruce Metzger saw it through
    the press almost single-handedly. The NRSV, published in 1990,
    made changes to the RSV in paragraph structure and
    construction, eliminated archaisms while retaining the
    Tyndale-King James tradition, polished renderings in the
    interest of accuracy, clarity, and felicity of English
    expression, and eliminated masculine language referring to
    people, insofar as this did not distort historical accuracy. In
    1993 Bruce Metzger presented a copy of the NRSV, Catholic
    Edition, to Pope John Paul II at the Vatican. Bruce Metzger
    understood and was passionate about the significance of
    biblical translation for ecumenical dialogue. In 1957 he served
    on the committee that translated the Apocrypha (the committee
    comprised the original RSV Committee plus Metzger, Floyd
    Filson, Robert Pfeiffer, and Allen Wikgren). In 1972 he chaired
    the sub-committee that translated 3 and 4 Maccabees and Psalm
    151 for an expanded version of the Apocrypha. He personally
    presented this expanded version to His All Holiness Demetrios I
    in 1976. It was important to him that Roman Catholic, Greek
    Orthodox, and Protestant Christians be able to have recourse to
    a common biblical text as an instrument of unity.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P4"/>[4] Bruce
    Metzger cared about and provided for his students. Generations
    have been grateful for his <hi rend="italic">Lists of Words Occurring
    Frequently in the Coptic New Testament</hi>, and his <hi rend="italic">Lexical
    Aids for Students of New Testament Greek</hi> (first published
    in 1946) became a standard study tool. He edited <hi rend="italic">The Oxford
    Annotated Bible</hi> in 1962, and in 1966, along with Kurt
    Aland, Matthew Black and Allen Wikgren, edited the United Bible
    Societies’ edition of the Greek New Testament. This text,
    especially adapted to meet the needs of Bible translators, with
    its beautiful original font and indication of the relative
    degree of certainty for each variant adopted in the text,
    proved to be an enduring landmark. The editors were later
    joined by Carlo Martini (the Cardinal Archbishop of Milan from
    1980 to 2002). A warm friendship grew between Metzger and
    Matthew Black, the doyen of Scottish text-critical scholars.
    The honorary degree of Doctor of Divinity from St Andrews
    University was bestowed on Bruce Metzger in 1964, and all Scots
    are moved by seeing that he is wearing his St Andrews tie in
    his portrait in the Speer Library.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P5"/>[5] There
    were other honors. In 1994, Bruce Metzger was awarded the
    Burkitt Medal for Biblical Studies by The British Academy in
    London (of which he had been a Corresponding Fellow since
    1978). This is only awarded in recognition of a lifetime of
    distinguished Biblical study. Bruce Metzger was elected
    president of <hi rend="italic">Studiorum Novi Testamenti Societas</hi> (1971),
    the International Society of Biblical Literature (1971), and
    was the first president of the North American Patristic Society
    (1972). He was a member of the Institute for Advanced Study in
    Princeton (1969 and 1974) and visiting fellow at Clare Hall,
    Cambridge (1974) and Wolfson College, Oxford (1979).</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P6"/>[6] There
    were many other books, among which the classic studies <hi rend="italic">The
    Text of the New Testament, its Transmission, Corruption and
    Restoration</hi> (1964, and translated into German, Japanese,
    Korean, Chinese, Italian and Russian) and <hi rend="italic">The Early Versions
    of the New Testament, their Origin, Transmission, and
    Limitations</hi> (1977) have been particularly influential.
    Bruce Metzger’s last publication before his death was
    <hi rend="italic">Apostolic Letters of Faith, Hope, and Love: Galatians, 1
    Peter, and I John</hi> (2006).</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P7"/>[7] Bruce
    Metzger cared passionately about the Bible, and in 1982 became
    the general editor of the <hi rend="italic">Reader’s Digest Condensed
    Bible</hi>. He lectured throughout the nation and the world, in
    North and South America, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, Korea,
    Japan, and South Africa, often at churches and universities
    where his former students ministered and taught. He was awarded
    honorary doctorates by Lebanon Valley College, Findlay College,
    St. Andrews University, the University of Münster, and
    Potchefstroom University in South Africa.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P8"/>[8] A Bible
    autographed by Bruce Metzger is sealed in the time capsule
    embedded in the corner of Scheide Hall.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P9"/>[9] Despite
    all his distinctions, Bruce Metzger never lost his modesty, or
    his courteous welcome, genuine interest in and encouragement
    for much younger scholars. He was a warm and supportive
    colleague within the Seminary and beloved by many scholars and
    lay people here in Princeton and throughout the world.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P10"/>[10]
    Bruce Metzger is survived by his wife Isobel and his sons John
    Mackay Metzger and James Bruce Metzger. A memorial service to
    give thanks for Bruce Metzger’s life was held on Tuesday,
    20<hi rend="sup">th</hi> February at 2.00pm in Nassau Presbyterian
    Church.</p>

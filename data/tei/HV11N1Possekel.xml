         <div type="abstract">
            <p>Apocalyptic imagery was widespread in the
    Greek and Latin patristic literature but occurs relatively
    seldom in the early Syriac sources. This paper surveys the
    eschatologies of Bardaisan, the <hi rend="italic">Odes of Solomon</hi>, and
    the <hi rend="italic">Acts of Thomas</hi> and suggests specific theological,
    sociological, and historical reasons why apocalyptic motifs
    were not employed on a large scale. Bardaisan’s
    opposition to Marcion would have made him reluctant to draw on
    any type of dualistic imagery, and his social setting at the
    center, not at the margins of his community was not one that
    typically gave rise to apocalyptic discourse. The
    <hi rend="italic">Odes’</hi> joyful praise of salvation experienced
    already now leaves no room for looming disasters or cosmic
    battles. Only the <hi rend="italic">Acts of Thomas</hi> contain one element
    found in apocalyptic literature: a tour of hell, which in the
    <hi rend="italic">Acts</hi> serves a parenetic function. This paper also
    suggests that the scarcity of apocalyptic motifs in early
    Syriac Christianity can to some extent be attributed to the
    location of these Christians at the frontier.</p>

    Apocalypses and apocalyptic images are widespread in the Greek
    and Latin patristic literature.<ref target="#FN1">1</ref> In this paper, I shall ask
    whether these apocalyptic traditions played a similarly
    prominent role for the earliest Syriac-speaking Christians.
    Early Syriac Christianity was diverse, and one site of multiple
    early Christianities was the city of Edessa in Mesopotamia,
    later to become one of the great centers of Syriac Christian
    theology and spirituality. By the late second century various
    Christian groups existed here side by side: Gnostics,
    Marcionites, Bardaisanites, and the so-called Palutians,
    predecessors of the later normative church.<ref target="#FN2">2</ref> Of the earliest
    Edessan Christian communities, it was the group around
    Bardaisan (d. 222) that has left the most
    extensive—although still rather fragmentary—written
    record. We shall first ask how Bardaisan and his community
    envisioned the end, and then interpret their eschatological
    expectations within the social context of the early
    Bardaisanite community. In addition, two further bodies of
    early Syriac Christian literature shall be examined here with
    regard to their imagination of the end, namely the <hi rend="italic">Odes of
    Solomon</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Acts of Thomas</hi>, composed most
    likely in the second and early third centuries, respectively.
    Both the <hi rend="italic">Odes</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Acts of Thomas</hi>
    originated in approximately the same era in which Bardaisan
    flourished, but they can not easily be associated with a
    particular locality, so that it becomes much more difficult to
    interpret them within their social contexts. How did these
    early Syriac Christians envision the end? What expectations did
    they hold concerning the last judgment and the world to come?
    Did they employ apocalyptic imagery to describe the end? And if
    not, why not? We shall begin this survey with Bardaisan, the
    theologian from Edessa.</p>
         <head xml:id="HV11N1Possekel3">1. Bardaisan</head>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P2"/>[2] While
    the <hi rend="italic">Odes</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Acts of Thomas</hi> are of
    unknown provenance, it is quite certain that Bardaisan
    flourished in the city of Edessa in northern Mesopotamia, for
    not only is he named after the river Daisan that flows through
    the city, but an eyewitness account of his activity at the
    king’s court has come down to us from the pen of Julius
    Africanus.<ref target="#FN3">3</ref> Bardaisan’s thought is preserved in
    fragments of his own writings, in refutations by later
    opponents, and in the <hi rend="italic">Book of the Laws of the
    Countries</hi>—the only contiguous text from
    Bardaisan’s community that has come down to
    us—compiled by a disciple in the early third
    century.<ref target="#FN4">4</ref> Although Bardaisan’s later followers came
    to be regarded as heretical on account of their inability to
    adapt to the emerging doctrinal consensus, Bardaisan in his
    time was regarded as a champion of orthodoxy<ref target="#FN5">5</ref> and made significant
    contributions to the theological discourse among
    Syriac-speaking Christians.<ref target="#FN6">6</ref> Bardaisan, a philosopher, a former
    astrologer, and an adult convert to Christianity, formulated
    his theology in the culturally and religiously diverse Edessan
    milieu.<ref target="#FN7">7</ref>
         </p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P3"/>[3] Scholars
    of apocalyptic literature, such as Hultgård in his work
    on Persian apocalypticism, have stressed that there is a
    coherence between an author’s theology of the end of the
    world and his theology of its beginning, his cosmogony.<ref target="#FN8">8</ref> A similar
    coherence should be observable between an author’s
    theology of the end of an individual and his theology of human
    nature, his anthropology. This connection is clearly evident in
    Bardaisan. Just as Bardaisan’s cosmogony informed his
    cosmic eschatology, so did his anthropology form the basis of
    his individual eschatology. It is the latter, his individual
    eschatology, to which I shall turn first.</p>
         <head xml:id="HV11N1Possekel4">1.1. The Individual Resurrection</head>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P4"/>[4]
    Bardaisan upheld the Christian teaching of the resurrection of
    the individual, yet he believed that only the human soul, not
    the body, would rise from death. In my previous research I have
    shown that Bardaisan’s belief about the resurrection of
    the soul alone is rooted in his anthropology, which was
    principally intended to refute fatalism.<ref target="#FN9">9</ref> To summarize the
    argument briefly, Bardaisan held that human beings, created by
    God, are charged to follow the divine commandments,<ref target="#FN10">10</ref> and as
    beings endowed with free will they are capable of choosing the
    good and right behavior. Indeed, acting rightly is natural to
    humankind, Bardaisan argued, for when a person acts rightly,
    feelings of joy and gladness arise, whereas evil deeds result
    in feelings of anger and shame<ref target="#FN11">11</ref>—an interesting
    precursor to the Ignatian “discernment of
    spirits”!<ref target="#FN12">12</ref> Yet many challenged Bardaisan’s doctrine
    of free will, arguing instead that human behavior is
    conditioned by fate. Bardaisan therefore needed to formulate an
    anthropology which on the one hand maintained human freedom,
    and on the other hand could explain the misfortunes of life
    that inevitably befall some people, but are generally
    undesired, such as illness, poverty, or breakdown in human
    relationships.<ref target="#FN13">13</ref> Bardaisan’s anthropological solution was
    to concede that the body—but only the body—may be
    subject to disturbing planetary influences, which are
    understood to be the cause of life’s uncontrollable
    misfortunes.<ref target="#FN14">14</ref> Human freedom, however, is not subject to
    fate, and in order to uphold this position, Bardaisan had to
    posit that free will, the ability to fulfill the divine
    commandments, must be independent of one’s bodily
    constitution.<ref target="#FN15">15</ref> Consequently, he located human identity in the
    mind or soul—the seat of free will—drawing on Greek
    philosophy rather than on the biblical notion of a human being
    as a psychosomatic unity. Bardaisan regarded the human body as
    only a secondary constituent of human nature, which “even
    without the sin of Adam would turn to its dust.”<ref target="#FN16">16</ref> Out of
    this anthropology, which locates personhood in the human soul,
    arose his conviction that only the soul would rise at the
    resurrection.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P5"/>[5]
    Bardaisan substantiated his view of the resurrection of the
    soul by means of exegetical arguments. Unfortunately, these are
    only very partially preserved in Ephrem’s later
    refutation of Bardaisan, a text which itself only exists in the
    form of a palimpsest. The exegetical fragments that were thus
    preserved address the fall of humankind, words spoken by Jesus,
    and the story of Christ’s descent into Sheol.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P6"/>[6] With
    regard to the fall, Bardaisan noted that according to the
    Genesis account the consequence of Adam’s sin would be
    death (Gen 2:17). Yet it was not Adam, but Abel killed by Cain
    who was the first to die, and hence Bardaisan concluded that
    the death which would be the recompense of sin (Rom 6:23) must
    be the death not of the body, but of the soul.<ref target="#FN17">17</ref> Among
    Jesus’ words recorded in the Gospel, Bardaisan found
    confirmation of his resurrection theology in the text of John
    8:51, in which Jesus promises: “Everyone who keeps my
    word will not taste death forever.”<ref target="#FN18">18</ref> Bardaisan
    observed that, despite this promise of immortality,
    Jesus’ followers had physically died. Therefore, Jesus
    must have used the word “death” to refer to the
    death of soul. Thirdly, Bardaisan pointed to the story of
    Christ’s descent to Sheol to support his belief that only
    the soul will be resurrected. Had the consequence of
    Adam’s sin been death of the body, he reasoned, Christ
    ought to have brought back from Sheol the bodies, which
    evidently was not the case. Bardaisan wondered: “Our
    Lord, who was raised, why did he not raise all their bodies, so
    that as their destruction was by Adam, so their resurrection
    should be by our Lord?”<ref target="#FN19">19</ref>
         </p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P7"/>[7]
    Bardaisan’s individual eschatology was thus shaped by two
    major conceptions. The first was an understanding of human
    nature which locates personhood exclusively in the soul, an
    anthropology which he formulated with the apologetic purpose of
    rejecting the astrologers’ claim that planetary
    constellations determine human actions, a position that he
    himself had formerly embraced.<ref target="#FN20">20</ref> The second major component
    of Bardaisan’s individual eschatology was a
    salvation-historical approach: the consequence of Adam’s
    sin was death—understood as death of soul, the essential
    part of human nature; death was overcome by Christ, whose
    teachings enabled the soul, hitherto condemned to Sheol, to
    rise up and pass over into the kingdom.<ref target="#FN21">21</ref>
         </p>
         <head xml:id="HV11N1Possekel5">1.2. Bardaisan’s Cosmogony</head>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P8"/>[8]
    Bardaisan’s general eschatology, as has been mentioned
    above, is rooted in his cosmogony. For Bardaisan, the cosmos is
    the work of God the creator, but he does not consider this as a
    creation from nothing. The concept of a <hi rend="italic">creatio ex
    nihilo</hi> was just emerging as normative Christian doctrine
    in his time, and Bardaisan was not alone in assuming the
    existence of primordial matter.<ref target="#FN22">22</ref> Bardaisan assumed the
    pre-existence of several elements which possessed some kind of
    power.<ref target="#FN23">23</ref> Out of these, God fashioned the world. The
    elements now occur in a mixture, not in their originally pure
    state, yet they retain some of their primeval power. In
    particular, the heavenly bodies retain some of this
    power—which for Bardaisan constitutes fate—but at
    the same time, they are subject to the laws imposed by God, the
    creator.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P9"/>[9] It
    should be emphasized that this cosmogony is not a dualistic
    creation myth, as can be found among some Gnostic groups or in
    the Iranian apocalyptic tradition.<ref target="#FN24">24</ref> To be sure, Bardaisan
    acknowledges the existence of evil, which is the work of the
    enemy.<ref target="#FN25">25</ref> Evil occurs when a person does not act
    rightly, does not follow his or her natural inclination to do
    good, or is perturbed or unwell in his or her nature.<ref target="#FN26">26</ref> In
    Bardaisan’s thought, however, evil clearly is not a
    cosmic force, battling with the good God on the level of
    equals. Indeed, throughout the <hi rend="italic">Book of the Laws of the
    Countries</hi>, Bardaisan strongly emphasizes the goodness and
    one-ness of God the creator, thereby taking an explicitly
    anti-Marcionite position, as has been argued by Han
    Drijvers.<ref target="#FN27">27</ref> The anti-Marcionite orientation of
    Bardaisan’s theology is of significance for his
    eschatology, and I will come back to it below.</p>
         <head xml:id="HV11N1Possekel6">1.3. The Last Judgment</head>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P10"/>[10]
    Repeatedly, Bardaisan in the <hi rend="italic">Book of the Laws of the
    Countries</hi> refers to the end of the world, and to the
    judgment to be held on the last day.<ref target="#FN28">28</ref> History, then, is
    regarded neither as infinite—although Bardaisan
    postulates the pre-existence of elements—nor as cyclic;
    rather, it is conceived as having a beginning and an end in
    time. On the last day, judgment will be made of all, based on
    whether or not they used their free will, a gift from God, to
    act according to the divine commandments.<ref target="#FN29">29</ref> Bardaisan stated:
    “And it is given to (a human being) that he should live
    according to his own (free) will, and do all that he is able to
    do, if he wishes to do it, or if he does not wish, not to do
    it. And he may justify himself or become guilty.”<ref target="#FN30">30</ref> This
    emphasis on the freedom of the human will and its ability to
    perform good deeds worthy of eternal life, although rejected by
    the Protestant reformers in the sixteenth century, was shared
    by many other early theologians, who, like Bardaisan, wished to
    refute the fatalism so widespread in late antique society. It
    is not a harmful native horoscope, nor the influence of
    maleficent stars that leads people to sin, they maintained, but
    a person’s free will.<ref target="#FN31">31</ref>
         </p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P11"/>[11]
    Whereas Bardaisan’s understanding of a last judgment of
    people, based on their deeds, was within the mainstream of
    early Christianity, another aspect of his eschatology was not.
    According to the theologian from Edessa, not only human beings,
    but also some elements of the cosmos will be subjected to
    judgment. Although he continually emphasized God’s
    sovereignty over all of creation, he conceded that the elements
    and heavenly bodies did not lose all of their power due to the
    mixture of creation. To be sure, whatever power they still have
    is granted to them by God, but on account of this remaining
    freedom they, too, will be judged, as Bardaisan explained to
    his somewhat puzzled disciples.</p>

         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P12"/>[12] As
    was noted earlier, Bardaisan understood world history as a
    process with a clear beginning and an end. This universe was
    ordered in a particular way by divine decree, and this order
    was to remain “until the course is completed and measure
    and number have been fulfilled, as it was ordained beforehand
    by him who commanded what the course should be and the
    completion of all creatures and the constitution of all
    elements (<hi rend="italic">’itye</hi>) and natures
    (<hi rend="italic">kyane</hi>).”<ref target="#FN36">36</ref> World history is thus aimed at
    perfection, at completion of its prescribed course. It does not
    depend on human action, but will occur according to the divine
    decree.<ref target="#FN37">37</ref> At the end of time, according to Bardaisan,
    there will be a new world, which will be perfect and free of
    strife. Again, as in his cosmogony, the metaphor of mixture
    plays a prominent role in his description of the world to come.
    The new world will be founded upon a different intermixture, in
    which even the remaining freedom of the elements, which
    potentially could cause harm, will disappear. There will be,
    Bardaisan explained, different planetary conjunctions that will
    no longer produce strife and misery. In the world to come,
    there will be no place for inequalities, misfortunes, and even
    foolishness! Bardaisan described this peacefulness and
    perfection of the eschatological aeon in the conclusion of the
    <hi rend="italic">Book of the Laws of the Countries</hi>: “In the
    constitution of this new world all evil impulses will have
    ceased and all rebellions will have ended, and the foolish will
    be convinced and every want filled, and there will be
    tranquility and peace through the gift of the Lord of all
    natures.”<ref target="#FN38">38</ref>

            <anchor corresp="P13"/>[13]
    Bardaisan’s expectations of the end thus form a coherent
    system of thought that is based upon his anthropology and his
    cosmogony. Yet perhaps somewhat surprisingly, we find little
    detail in the remaining literature of the Bardaisanites about
    the end of time. There are no references to a cosmic battle, to
    natural catastrophes, or other images typical of apocalyptic
    literature. Yet we may assume that Bardaisan, a bilingual man
    and an educated philosopher, was familiar with some form of
    apocalypticism, for it was widely spread across linguistic and
    cultural boundaries, as is evident from Jewish apocalypses,
    Graeco-Roman oracles, and the Sibyllines.<ref target="#FN39">39</ref> The thirteenth
    chapter of Mark presents a picture of the end times, and this
    text was at least partially included in the Diatessaron and
    thus available to Syriac-speaking Christians. In the second
    century, a number of apocalyptic writings were produced by
    Christian communities in the Roman Empire, and several early
    Christian writings, even if they were not apocalypses <hi rend="italic">per
    se</hi>, made use of apocalyptic ideas and images.<ref target="#FN40">40</ref>
    Moreover, other systems of thought prevalent in Mesopotamia,
    such as Zoroastrianism, have produced elaborate apocalyptic
    treatises.<ref target="#FN41">41</ref> Why then, we are led to wonder, did Bardaisan
    refrain from employing apocalyptic imagery?</p>
         <head xml:id="HV11N1Possekel8">1.5. Theological and Social Context</head>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P14"/>[14]
    Bardaisan’s omission of apocalyptic language was, I
    think, a deliberate decision on his part. Two reasons—one
    theological, the other sociological—suggest that this was
    the case. First, apocalyptic images often present the rising up
    of evil powers that challenge the existing order, and are
    finally overcome by God, who establishes a new
    creation.<ref target="#FN42">42</ref> This type of imagery is dualistic in spirit,
    even if it does not picture the opposition of two nearly equal
    divine figures, such as Ahura Mazda and Angra Mainyu in Persian
    apocalypticism. Bardaisan, it seems, would have avoided at all
    costs the introduction of such imagery into his theological
    discourse, for one of his major goals was to refute the
    Marcionite claim of the existence of two gods. His
    anti-Marcionite stance, which earned him praise from Eusebius,
    would have been reason enough to avoid images of a final cosmic
    battle.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P15"/>[15] The
    second reason why Bardaisan might not have been inclined to
    employ apocalyptic elements in his theology pertains to the
    social setting, the <hi rend="italic">Sitz im Leben</hi>, of apocalypticism.
    Scholars such as Isenberg, Hanson, Nickelsburg, and Frankfurter
    have studied the cultural setting of Jewish and Christian
    apocalyptic movements and have suggested that apocalyptic
    literature often arises in communities who feel marginalized by
    the social or religious majority. Nickelsburg sums up
    Hanson’s approach:</p>
         <quote>
      Ancient apocalyptic movements have a common <hi rend="italic">social
      setting</hi> in which a group experiences alienation due to
      the disintegration of the life-sustaining socio-religious
      structures and their supporting myths. Institutional
      structures may be physically destroyed or a community may
      find itself excluded from the dominant society and its
      symbolic universe.<ref target="#FN43">43</ref>
         </quote>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P16"/>[16] What
    then, was the situation in Edessa in the time of Bardaisan? Our
    reconstruction of the Edessan milieu in the early third century
    must rely largely on material remains, reports by Roman
    historians, and later literary sources, for indigenous literary
    productions from this era are lacking (apart from the remains
    of Bardaisan’s corpus). Nonetheless, careful
    interpretation of the sources gives much insight into Edessan
    culture in late antiquity. By the end of the second century,
    Edessa had been an independent kingdom for more than three
    hundred years,<ref target="#FN44">44</ref> striving to balance alliances with the
    adjacent “superpowers” Rome and Parthia.<ref target="#FN45">45</ref> During
    Bardaisan’s adulthood in the 190s, King Abgar VIII
    attempted to regain independence, but Septimius Severus
    (193-211) occupied the region and established Osrhoene as a
    Roman province in the year 195. Thereafter, the Edessan king
    adopted an attitude of greater loyalty to Rome. He took a Roman
    name, sent his sons as political hostages to Rome, offered the
    emperor the services of his world-renowned archers, and
    personally visited the imperial capital.<ref target="#FN46">46</ref> Edessa became a
    Roman <hi rend="italic">colonia</hi> under Caracalla (in 213), but the
    kingship continued, at least nominally, until the 240s
    AD.<ref target="#FN47">47</ref> This political turmoil, and the disastrous
    flooding of the city in the year 201, however, does not appear
    to have destabilized Edessan society, for many of
    Edessa’s physical remains, in particular the astonishing
    mosaics, date from the early third century and indicate a
    flourishing city, self-confident in its artistic and cultural
    expressions. Moreover, Bardaisan’s group was far from
    being a marginalized community in search of a symbolic
    universe. Bardaisan was a nobleman, prominent at the Edessan
    court, a superb archer (as Julius Africanus relates), a
    musician, and a capable disputant. He believed that he defended
    Christian orthodoxy in his apologies against Marcionites,
    Gnostics, and astrologers. His group stood at the center of
    early third-century Syriac Christianity, not at its margins.
    Bardaisan’s expectations of the end, the judgment,
    resurrection, and the world to come are shaped by his cosmogony
    and his anthropology. The remaining fragments of his writings
    do not suggest use of apocalyptic imagery, which, I think, can
    at least be partially explained by his opposition to Marcionite
    dualism and by his prominent position in early Edessan
    society.</p>
         <head xml:id="HV11N1Possekel9">2. The Odes of Solomon</head>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P17"/>[17] Let
    us now turn to a very different literary production of the
    early Syriac church, the <hi rend="italic">Odes of Solomon</hi>, and the
    eschatological expectations expressed therein.<ref target="#FN48">48</ref> Unlike
    Bardaisan’s writings, this poetic collection can not
    easily be associated with a particular Christian community.
    Although efforts have been made to locate the <hi rend="italic">Odes</hi> in
    the early Edessan church, no specific internal or external
    evidence supports this hypothesis.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P18"/>[18]
    Space here does not permit an exhaustive treatment of the
    eschatology of the <hi rend="italic">Odes</hi>, and it must suffice to
    highlight some of the major themes.<ref target="#FN49">49</ref> The odist repeatedly
    expresses the joy that he feels for being united to the Lord,
    whom he has “put on.”<ref target="#FN50">50</ref> He extols the eternal life
    that he has acquired by joining himself to the Immortal
    One.<ref target="#FN51">51</ref> He knows himself already crowned with the
    Lord,<ref target="#FN52">52</ref> a crown that brings salvation.<ref target="#FN53">53</ref> The Lord has
    already given him eternal rest.<ref target="#FN54">54</ref> The Lord has rescued the
    poet from the “depth of Sheol” and has freed him
    from the “mouth of death.”<ref target="#FN55">55</ref> The odist is
    certain that he will not die,<ref target="#FN56">56</ref> for he is now already
    justified.<ref target="#FN57">57</ref> Already he has received salvation by leaving
    the way of error.<ref target="#FN58">58</ref> It is thus a realized eschatology that we
    find expressed in the <hi rend="italic">Odes of Solomon</hi>, one in which
    apocalyptic imagery, such as details of the coming judgment, or
    frightful descriptions of the disasters and crises that will
    accompany the end times, are lacking. There is no apocalyptic
    tour of hell, but there is a visionary glimpse of paradise with
    its abundance of vegetation, a land irrigated by the river of
    gladness.<ref target="#FN59">59</ref> Themes of joy, comfort, and trust dominate in
    these poems.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P19"/>[19] As
    dissimilar as the eschatology of the <hi rend="italic">Odes</hi> is from that
    of Bardaisan, neither one takes recourse to apocalyptic
    imagery. Moreover, they both employ the same striking image of
    crossing over into eternal life. Bardaisan teaches that the
    souls, previously unable to enter paradise—for they were
    hindered “at the crossing-place” (<hi lang="SYR"
                dir="rtl"
                style="font-family:'Estrangelo Edessa'"
                xml:lang="SYR">ܡܥܒܪܬܐ</hi>,
    <hi rend="italic">ma<hi rend="sup">c</hi>barta</hi>) by the sin of Adam—are now
    able, on account of Christ’s work, to cross at the
    crossing-place and to enter the bridal chamber of
    light.<ref target="#FN60">60</ref> Ephrem summarizes Bardaisan’s
    doctrine:</p>
         <quote>
      “And the life,” [Bardaisan said,] “that our
      Lord brought in<lb/>
      is that he taught truth and ascended,<lb/>
      and allowed them to pass over into the
      kingdom.”<ref target="#FN61">61</ref>
         </quote>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P20"/>[20]
    While for Bardaisan it is only the soul that crosses over into
    eternity, for the author of the <hi rend="italic">Odes</hi> the entire human
    person is able, through faith in the Lord, to cross the
    “raging rivers.” The odist’s poetic language
    does not spell out that this crossing takes the person from
    this world into the next, but the eschatological subtext of the
    hymn seems evident.</p>
         <quote>
      But those who cross them [i.e., the raging rivers] in
      faith<lb/>
      Shall not be disturbed.<lb/>

    Imagery drawn from the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament is

         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P22"/>[22] The
    <hi rend="italic">Acts of Thomas</hi>, written in the form of an ancient
    novel, relate the missionary journeys of the apostle Thomas to
    India.<ref target="#FN64">64</ref> The <hi rend="italic">Acts</hi> as a whole do not constitute
    apocalyptic literature,<ref target="#FN65">65</ref> but one element commonly found in
    apocalyptic treatises does occur in the <hi rend="italic">Acts of
    Thomas</hi>, namely a visionary description of the punishments
    of hell.<ref target="#FN66">66</ref> While the details of the account in the sixth
    act differ in the Greek and Syriac versions, the main story
    line is the same. Upon hearing Thomas’ preaching of a
    life of <hi rend="italic">enkrateia</hi>, a young man strove to persuade the
    woman he loved to become his “consort in chastity and
    pure conduct.”<ref target="#FN67">67</ref> Much to his chagrin, the woman refused,
    and lest she have intercourse with others, the young man killed
    her. His crime was revealed when his hands withered up as he
    received the Eucharist. He related the events to Thomas the
    apostle, who first healed the man’s disease and then
    accompanied him, followed by a great throng of people, to the
    woman’s house. She was raised to life and told of her
    extraordinary tour of hell and the punishments there to be
    suffered for various kinds of sins. Upon her revival, the woman
    converted, and so did the multitude of onlookers.<ref target="#FN68">68</ref>
         </p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P23"/>[23] The
    dead woman’s vision of hell functions in the <hi rend="italic">Acts of
    Thomas</hi> to instill in the audience fear of future
    punishments in order to enforce a certain moral code. Similar
    stories are preserved from other eras of Christian history, and
    they usually serve the same parenetic function. Bede, for
    example, relates that the medieval Englishman Drythelm chose to
    enter the monastic life after his tour of heaven and hell
    during a near-death experience revealed to him what was at
    stake.<ref target="#FN69">69</ref> The inclusion of this apocalyptic episode in
    the <hi rend="italic">Acts of Thomas</hi> shows that Syriac Christians were
    aware of apocalyptic literature and occasionally availed
    themselves of such themes,<ref target="#FN70">70</ref> but it remains a somewhat
    isolated example among the literature of the early Syriac
    church.</p>
         <head xml:id="HV11N1Possekel11">4. Conclusion</head>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P24"/>[24]
    Among the earliest Syriac-speaking Christians, the traditions
    surrounding both Bardaisan and the <hi rend="italic">Odes of Solomon</hi>
    show a marked absence of apocalyptic imagery, a somewhat
    surprising result considering the relative popularity of
    apocalyptic themes in the second century. For Bardaisan, the
    Edessan theologian about whose social setting we are fairly
    well informed, I have suggested specific theological and
    sociological reasons as to why he might have avoided
    apocalyptic symbols. Such considerations are impossible for the
    <hi rend="italic">Odes</hi>, for their provenance remains unknown. The
    attribution of this collection of poems to Solomon, however,
    indicates that the author was more attuned to the themes of
    wisdom literature than to those of apocalyptic writing.<ref target="#FN71">71</ref> The
    <hi rend="italic">Acts of Thomas</hi> include a visionary description of the
    punishments of hell, one element often found in apocalyptic
    literature, but as a whole they do not belong to the genre of
    apocalyptic. The <hi rend="italic">Acts</hi> thereby support our claim that
    early Syriac Christians were familiar with apocalyptic themes,
    but generally chose not to convey their theologies through the
    medium of apocalyptic.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P25"/>[25] Even
    in a social context of severe distress, some early Syriac
    Christians counseled wisdom and patience, rather than casting
    their situation into an apocalyptic framework. Mara bar
    Serapion, a prisoner of war en route to his exile in a foreign
    land, writes to his son with parental advice and
    admonition.<ref target="#FN72">72</ref> In his letter, probably composed in the third
    century,<ref target="#FN73">73</ref> he counsels his son to pursue wisdom and to
    meditate upon learning. The youth is to avoid the vanities of
    life, for worldly riches, fame, and beauty all may vanish.
    Wisdom, on the other hand, can not so easily be taken away, and
    can become for him a father and mother.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P26"/>[26] Why
    is it that apocalyptic images are so sparse in the early Syriac
    Christian literature? It is difficult to make generalizations,
    and any number of cultural factors might explain why the early
    Syriac Christians felt more drawn to wisdom traditions, as was
    the anonymous author of the <hi rend="italic">Odes of Solomon</hi>, or to a
    philosophical approach, as were Bardaisan and Mara bar
    Serapion. It may be attributable to their residence in a region
    constantly embattled by two empires, neither of which could
    easily be associated with good or evil. Such a geopolitical
    situation may have made them less inclined to develop a
    symbolic universe in which good and evil forces engage in a
    cosmic battle. It was only in later centuries that the
    Syriac-speaking communities availed themselves of apocalyptic
    imagery, when more clearly defined hostile empires threatened
    their very existence. In the fourth century, Aphrahat, the
    Persian sage, drew on the apocalyptic passages in the Book of
    Daniel and intimated the eventual demise of the Sassanian
    Empire.<ref target="#FN74">74</ref> And in the seventh century, in the context of
    the Arab conquests of the Near East, anonymous Syriac authors
    ascribed full-fledged apocalyptic sermons to the authority of
    two ancient and venerated figures, Ephrem and
    Methodius.<ref target="#FN75">75</ref>

         <p>The most important witness for Bardaisan’s theology,
    besides the <hi rend="italic">BLC</hi>, is Ephrem, who repeatedly refers to
    Bardaisan’s ideas and occasionally quotes short fragments
    of Bardaisan’s writings in his <hi rend="italic">Prose Refutations</hi>
    (see note 2) and his <hi rend="italic">Hymns against Heresies</hi> (hereafter
    <hi rend="italic">CH</hi>), ed. with German tr. E. Beck, <hi rend="italic">Ephraem des
    Syrers Hymnen contra haereses</hi>, CSCO 169-170, Syr. 76-77
    (Louvain, 1957). Ephrem’s polemics, though biased,
    constitute a valuable source for Bardaisan’s thought and
    for the teachings of his community in the later fourth
    century.</p>
         <p>The numerous other witnesses to Bardaisan’s teachings
    in the Syriac, Greek, Latin, Armenian and Arabic literature,
    some of which are highly unreliable, can not be surveyed here.

            <ref target="#FNRef23">23</ref> That the primordial elements have a power of
    their own is stated in <hi rend="italic">BLC</hi> 10 and 46, ed. Drijvers,
    14,13-18 and 62,9-13. According to Bardaisan, the primordial
    elements are water, fire, wind, and air. The element of wind
    (<hi lang="SYR"
                dir="rtl"
                style="font-family:&#34;Estrangelo Edessa&#34;"
                xml:lang="SYR">ܪܘܚܐ</hi>, <hi rend="italic">ru<hi rend="u">h</hi>a</hi>) was probably included for exegetical
    reasons. On the interpretation of the <hi rend="italic">rua<hi rend="u">h</hi> elohim</hi> (Gen 1:2) among Syriac Christians, cf.
    S. Brock, “The <hi rend="italic">Rua<hi rend="u">h</hi>

    the Syriac Tradition,” in: <hi rend="italic">Lectures et relectures de

    A. Wénin, Bibliotheca Ephemeridum Theologicarum
    Lovaniensium 144 (Louvain: Peeters, 1999), 327-349.
    Bardaisan’s elements therefore differ from the
    Empedoclean ones (air, fire, water, earth). Most early
    Christian authors accepted the existence of the Empedoclean
    elements, which they believed to have been created by God.
    According to some of the later Syriac sources, Bardaisan
    posited the existence of a primordial darkness below the primal
    elements, and of God above them, but it remains questionable
    whether such a system goes back to Bardaisan. <ref target="#FNRef23">

            <ref target="#FNRef24">24</ref> Gnostic texts often regard the created world
    as negative, as work of the demiurge. An overview of Gnostic
    apocalyptic texts is given by F. Fallon, “The Gnostic
    Apocalypses,” <hi rend="italic">Semeia</hi> 14 (1979), 123-158; see
    also M. Krause, “Die literarischen Gattungen der
    Apokalypsen von Nag Hammadi,” in: <hi rend="italic">Apocalypticism in
    the Mediterranean World</hi>, 621-637. In Zoroastrianism,
    dualism does not consist of contrasting matter and spirit, but
    two opposing divine principles. On Zoroastrian apocalypticism,
    see for example Hultgård, “Persian
    Apocalypticism,” 39-83. On Zoroastrian religious ideas
    more generally, see M. Boyce, <hi rend="italic">A History of
    Zoroastrianism</hi>, 3 vols., Handbuch der Orientalistik
    (Leiden: Brill, 1989); M. Boyce, <hi rend="italic">Zoroastrians, Their
    Religious Beliefs and Practices</hi> (London: Routledge, 1979).
    Zervanism, however, seeks to overcome the dualist system and
    proposes a highest god, cf. R. C. Zaehner, <hi rend="italic">Zurvan. A
    Zoroastrian Dilemma</hi> (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1955). The
    antiquity of Persian apocalypticism is a matter of debate since
    the most important texts date in their current form from the
    ninth century. The problems are summarized by Collins, <hi rend="italic">The
    Apocalyptic Imagination</hi>, 29-33 (with further
    bibliography). For an argument that the most ancient layer of
    Iranian apocalyptic originated not before the Sassanian period,
    see P. Gignoux, “L’apocalyptique iranienne est-elle

    “Towards the Morphology of a Genre.” In order to be
    classified as apocalyptic there needs to be a conjunction of
    several literary elements, a “significant cluster of
    traits,” (Collins) such as a narrative framework,
    visions, a revelation by an otherworldly being mediated to a
    human recipient, disclosure of a transcendent reality, and a
    final judgment. John Collins observes that “[t]he genre
    is not constituted by one or more distinctive themes but by a
    distinctive combination of elements, all of which are also
    found elsewhere.” (Collins, <hi rend="italic">Apocalyptic
    Imagination</hi>, 12). <ref target="#FNRef65">

    “Stoicismo e cristianesimo in area siriaca nella seconda

         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P1"/>[1] Anyone
    looking for a general history of the Assyrian Church of the
    East in English has had to be content to piece together such
    books as W. A. Wigram, <hi rend="italic">The Assyrian Church</hi> (1910),
    Samuel Moffett, <hi rend="italic">A History of Christianity in Asia</hi>
    (vol. 1, 1992), and A. Vine, <hi rend="italic">The Nestorian Churches</hi>
    (1937). They are all useful, but they are naturally quite
    disparate in their age, treatment of sources and level of
    scholarship. Winkler and Baum have now offered a
    through-composed history in one volume, covering the Church of
    the East from the beginnings right down to the end of the
    twentieth century.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P2"/>[2] The book
    is a translation, slightly revised, of <hi rend="italic">Die Apostolische
    Kirche des Ostens,</hi> published in 2000. Just occasionally
    the translation is faulty, as when we are told that 'In 1856
    during the Crimean War the British learned that in the
    so-called "Hatt-i-Humayun Decree" the old Ottoman millet system
    had been reestablished' (p. 128). In fact, the British were
    partly responsible for this measure, as the German text
    correctly says. On p. 83 <hi rend="italic">Magier</hi> are Magi, not
    'magicians', and on p. 86 the translator has taken 'Kolophon'
    to be the name of an author. But such lapses are seemingly
    rare, and the English generally reads well.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P3"/>[3] The
    strength of Winkler and Baur's book lies chiefly in the
    remarkable amount of information it manages to squeeze into its
    short length—and indeed it is much more dense reading
    than any of the books mentioned at the beginning of this
    review. Readers will be most astonished, perhaps, at the
    accumulation of inscriptional and other evidence from Central
    Asia, India and China that has come to light in recent years to
    suggest the extent of the church in the Middle Ages. (Some of
    this evidence is illustrated, notably a strange round
    gravestone with Syriac inscription from the fourteenth century
    in Central Asia, p. 77). The book shows its critical quality
    too, especially at some of the more sensitive points in chapter
    1. Discussing the origins of the church in Persia, Winkler
    carefully separates the tradition of apostolic origin from the
    other early evidence that is somewhat less tidy (pp. 
    7-14); and he argues that there never was a canonical
    dependence of the church on the patriarchate of Antioch (pp.
    19-20).</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P4"/>[4] At the
    other end of the book, Chapter 5, 'The twentieth century', is
    especially valuable, taking in the recovery of the Church of
    the East from near collapse to a 'stable and structured'
    condition (p. 155) at present. There is a full discussion of
    the ecumenical initiatives and successes of recent years, not
    sparing criticism for the Coptic bishops who have all too
    successfully held these back (pp. 151-2). A useful census of
    parishes ends the chapter. For more than half of the century
    the church was presided over by Mar Eshai Shimun, a complex and
    autocratic leader—he did not consecrate a bishop for over
    thirty years—and, as far as his theology went, a
    hard-shelled traditionalist. But the Mar Shimun era being now
    over, Winkler is inclined to pass over his less attractive side
    and give him much of the credit for the church's recovery.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P5"/>[5] There is
    one overall weakness that will unfortunately prevent this book
    from becoming a work of reference: the authors'
    decision—or perhaps it was the publisher's, to keep the
    book short—to dispense with footnotes or (with occasional
    exceptions) any citations of sources in the text. How can the
    reader verify the intriguing statements, for example, that
    'calendrical evidence' shows disagreement about the keeping of
    festivals before 410 (p. 15); or that bishop Rabbula of Edessa
    in his early years 'spoke up against Cyril' and only later
    changed sides (p. 22, 25); or that 'as early as 581 Turks with
    crosses on their foreheads had been placed in Byzantine
    prisons' (p. 47); or that Syriac ceased to be a vernacular
    'because of Islamic language laws' (p. 69); or that Kubilai
    Khan established an office of Christian affairs in 1289 (p.
    87); or that 'Around 1551 the East Syriac community in Tabriz
    disappeared' (p. 116)? The bibliography (pp. 178-94), although
    weighty, is not annotated, and the scholar who is (rightly!)
    not disposed to quote such statements without checking them
    will have a hard time doing so.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P6"/>[6] A
    reviewer of any book on the Church of the East is obliged to
    comment on how the word 'Nestorian' is used. Winkler, who has
    been a participant on the Catholic side in the ecumenical
    process, conscientiously avoids the word as an ordinary name,
    for reasons now familiar and sufficiently explained on pp. 4-5.
    (Generally he avoids 'Assyrian' too.) My impression is that
    Baum, whose assigned chapters 2-4 covering the 7th-19th
    centuries are not so dangerous in this regard, did not start
    with the same prohibition—or else that he found the
    word  impossible to avoid in certain contexts. He, or an
    editor, then sanitized it by using quotation marks. So for
    example we have a mention of '"Nestorian" texts in Central Asia
    and China' (p. 171). But this easy expedient (used by other
    authors too in recent years) will not do. The texts in question
    here are not related to Nestorius or christology; nor I think
    does the author mean to emphasize that others have
    <hi rend="italic">called</hi> them Nestorian. He is just looking for a plain
    and acceptable adjective meaning 'of or pertaining to the
    Church of the East'. Sadly there is no one such. 'East Syriac',
    itself not very elegant, will hardly work in the phrase above
    referring to texts that are mostly not in Syriac. 'Assyrian'
    would be even worse. In this case, since there is no question
    of any other church, I would suggest 'Christian' as the word to
    use. With the name '"Nestorian" cross' (pp. 50, 58, 74 etc.)
    there is a special need for clarity: is the meaning simply
    'cross', or—one hopes not—is this now an
    art-historical term for a cross of a particular shape?</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P7"/>[7] It is
    easy to point out shortcomings in a book intended to be, as its
    subtitle says, concise. It is, however, a valuable
    contribution, full of information, and—if too expensive
    for the ordinary reader to buy—it ought at least to have
    a place on all reading lists.</p>

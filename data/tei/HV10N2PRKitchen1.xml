         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P1"/>[1] It has
    seldom been an easy task to venture into the study of things
    Syriac. There are few places, even many theological
    institutions, where mention of the Syriac language and its
    churches elicits a response of recognition. Sources and
    reference materials, therefore, are not readily located, so
    where to begin is a matter of first importance.  Sebastian
    Brock’s second small volume recently republished in an
    updated edition remedies the situation. <hi rend="italic">An
    Introduction to Syriac Studies</hi> was written originally in
    1980 for a publication in Birmingham targeted towards
    undergraduates, but over time became inaccessible to most
    students.  Kristian Heal of the Center for the
    Preservation of Ancient Religious Texts (CPART) at Brigham
    Young University first rescued the publication from
    no-longer-in-print status and published it electronically on
    the CPART website.  Now Gorgias Press has reissued the
    book with a number of additions and updates which Brock happily
    notes is the good sign of significant growth and interest in
    the field of Syriac studies.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P2"/>[2] This may be called an introduction, but it is
    worth the time reading through for any student or experienced
    scholar. Particularly helpful are the initial sections on
    “what is Syriac” and “why one should study
    it,” matters typically raised by all sorts of people, but
    seldom answered in an articulate way. The section on the
    scope of Syriac literature is all too brief, but after all this
    is intended only to be an introduction, so Brock continually
    points the reader towards other more in-depth resources. 
    Nevertheless, Brock’s enthusiasm and delight in the
    subject quickly infect even the oldest hand.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P3"/>[3]
     The fourth section on the place of Syriac among the
    Aramaic dialects, along with a chart that locates Aramaic in
    the family of Semitic languages, is very helpful for the
    student who is entering Syriac from a
    Biblical/Hebrew/theological background.  A brief
    description of the Syriac scripts is helpful, though it would
    have been nice to see some actual scripts as examples. 
    Indeed, that would be the only real criticism of this
    handbook—given the facility of computerized publishing
    and the availability of numerous Syriac fonts—a few
    examples of the different Syriac scripts and fonts would
    obviously aid in visualization for the beginner.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P4"/>[4] Chapter
    Five, “Tools,” by necessity has been updated the
    most extensively, and in many instances, dramatically. 
    Grammars, chrestomathies, dictionaries begin; then an excellent
    overview of the status of the Syriac Bible, Old and New
    Testaments, and their various editions - particular notice
    being given to the progress of the Leiden Old Testament
    Peshitta project and George Kiraz’s computer-generated
    concordance to the Peshitta.  Next, histories of Syriac
    literature are listed as well as works on the historical
    background of Syriac culture and churches, taking care to point
    out the different trajectories of the East and West Syriac
    traditions. The ever expanding knowledge explosion in
    Syriac studies is indicated in the lists of bibliographical
    aids, the various old and new series of texts and translations,
    periodicals, encyclopedias, festschrifts and volumes of
    collected essays.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P5"/>[5] The
    Epilogue may not be part of a formal academic introduction, but
    “The Delights of Manuscripts” should result in more
    people engaging this adventure. Brock relates tales of his own
    joys and excitement in the presence of ancient manuscripts in
    which, as he writes concerning holding the oldest dated Syriac
    manuscript in the British Library’s Oriental Reading
    Room, “It does not take much imagination to find oneself
    transported back across time and space to Edessa in November
    411.” Brock’s enthusiasm is catching as he takes
    the reader on a tour from Sinai to Damascus, Tur Abdin and back
    to the Bodleian.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P6"/>[6]
     The Appendix, “The Syriac Churches,” signals
    a road seldom traveled in years past. Obviously, most
    Syriac literature is immersed in the life of the
    Syriac-speaking churches, but often the gap between the academy
    and the congregation has not been bridged.  Brock
    delineates the various members of the Syriac Body of Christ and
    their positions relative to the Christological controversies
    and historical allegiances to other denominations with the aid
    of several charts and diagrams.  Clarification and
    correction of the terms Nestorian and Monophysite is a critical
    insertion in order to facilitate ecumenical dialogue. 
    Included as well are articles and books describing in more
    detail the history and ethos of the individual churches,
    whether in the Near East, Europe, the Americas and India.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P7"/>[7]
     There are certainly other scholars who could compile a
    similarly excellent introduction to the study of Syriac; here
    we may listen to the voice of the scholar who has had a
    significant role in putting it all together.</p>

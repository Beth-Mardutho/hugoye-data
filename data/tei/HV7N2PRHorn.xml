            <anchor corresp="P1"/>[1] In four
    chapters of varying length and in just above one hundred pages,
    the Austrian historian, theologian, and philosopher Wilhelm
    Baum presents the first ever monographic study of the story of
    Shirin, a fascinating tale of the life and love of an
    influential Christian Persian queen at the end of Sassanid
    rule. Baum, who recently co-authored a brief introduction to
    the theology and history of the Apostolic Church of the East
    together with Dietmar Winkler, also brings his formidable
    knowledge of the Christian Church in Asia to bear on the
    subject matter in this work.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P2"/>[2] A story
    situated at the intersection of erotic attraction, faithful
    married love, and the exercise of political power, the life of
    Shirin, Christian wife of the Persian king of kings Chosroe II
    (590-628) kept the interest of writers, East and West, ancient
    and modern. Baum traces precisely that interest and
    distinguishes four periods in the reception history of
    literature dealing with Shirin. A first period consists of
    comments in Byzantine, Syrian, Armenian, and Frankish church
    historians and chroniclers from the seventh through the ninth
    century. Literary witnesses now only from within the Apostolic
    Church of the East in the form of the eleventh-century
    <hi rend="italic">Chronicle of Seert</hi> and the twelfth-century biographies
    of the patriarchs by the Syrian Mari ibn Suleiman constitute
    the second period. Poets and artists discovered Shirin for the
    Islamic world, increasingly leaving behind the religious and
    political factors of her historical story, and instead seeing
    in her the ideal of the (female) lover, who dedicated herself
    wholeheartedly to her beloved, even beyond death. Realizations
    of this level of reception history are to be found in
    Firdausi's Persian national poem <hi rend="italic">Shahname</hi>, the epic
    <hi rend="italic">Chosroe and Shirin</hi> of the twelfth-century Azerbaijani
    poet Nizami, and the highly imaginative epic <hi rend="italic">Ferhad and
    Shirin</hi> by Ali Shir Navai, a 15<hi rend="sup">th</hi>-century
    Turkish poet. It is the Shirin of this third level, with a view
    of Shirin as a remarkably attractive and committed lover, that
    has circulated most widely; no wonder, since miniatures of
    respective, sometimes explicit scenes of her (love) life
    illustrated numerous manuscripts in Afghanistan, Persia,
    throughout the Ottoman Empire, and India (see Baum,
    <hi rend="italic">Schirin</hi>, color plates III-VI and IX-XVI). The
    Enlightenment with its growing interest in exotic stories from
    the East also brought Shirin more fully to the attention of the
    European audience. Johann Wolfgang von Goethe's <hi rend="italic">West-East
    Divan</hi> received inspiration from the Orientalist Josef von
    Hammer-Purgstall's <hi rend="italic">Schirin</hi>, a work published in 1809
    as a free paraphrase of excerpts of Persian and Arabic
    poetry.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P3"/>[3] The
    first chapter of Baum's study offers a brief overview of
    Christian history in Sassanid Persia, from the persecutions of
    Christians at the time of the Zoroastrian Mobed Kartir around
    A.D. 280, to the reign of the Islamic Caliph Ali (†
    661), who is to be regarded as the cornerstone of Shi'ite
    self-definition. In a style and manner that is accessible to
    specialists and non-specialists alike, Baum presents the basic
    data of the developments of post-Constantinian Christian
    theology and hierarchy formation of the first ecumenical
    councils, and identifies main differences between the Christian
    Church within the Roman Empire and the Church in Persia,
    customarily identified as the Apostolic Church of the East and
    eventually headed by the metropolitan of the Persian capital,
    Seleucia-Ctesiphon, as Catholicos.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P4"/>[4]
    According to tradition, apostolic succession in the Church of
    the East is to be traced back to the Apostle Thomas as well as
    to Addai and Mari, the former being one of Jesus' seventy
    disciples, the latter being Addai's disciple. Not accepting any
    ecumenical councils beyond Nicaea (A.D. 325) and Constantinople
    I (A.D. 381), the Apostolic Church of the East also established
    its complete independence from the Patriarchate of Antioch, and
    thus from the Church of the Byzantine Empire, under Catholicos
    Dadisho in 424.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P5"/>[5] Being
    accustomed to using the Syriac and Middle Persian languages in
    their liturgies, East Syrian Christian scholars employed Syriac
    as the key tool in the transmission history of Greek philosophy
    to the new Arab rulers during early Islamic times. Having been
    brutally persecuted under Shapur II (341-379), Christians
    succeeded in acquiring positions of influence and prestige in
    the Sassanid Empire from the fifth century on. King of Kings
    Hormizd IV and Catholicos Ishoyahb I of Arzum (582-596)
    supported each other's interests. Metropolitan Elias of Merv
    may even have converted the Turkish Khan in the seventh
    century. The East Syrian missionary monk Alopen brought
    Christianity to the court of the Chinese Emperor in Xian in
    635. At such a point in time of relative Christian strength and
    influence, Shirin met and married Chosroe II.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P6"/>[6] In the
    Persian Empire Christianity never was the religion of the
    majority. Rather, it functioned as one religion among many,
    being influenced by and exercising influence upon others. Thus
    Baum's discussion of potential parallels between Christianity
    on the one hand and Zoroastrianism or Manichaeism on the other
    is in place. The danger of any summary presentation of such a
    topic is to formulate statements in too general or too
    provocative a manner. A claim to the effect that Christianity's
    adversity to sexuality is an inheritance from Manichaeism (p.
    23) is an obvious case in point for the author's falling prey
    to that danger. Given that Baum's interest in the present study
    is not a general comparison of world religions, but rather the
    investigation of a specific female figure, Shirin, his case
    would have gained from highlighting more fully the details of
    the cult of the goddess Anahit (pp. 21 and 44) in the early
    Sassanid Empire. The reader is left to wonder if there might be
    more of a connection between her and Shirin, beyond merely the
    question of which of the two female figures' image is
    represented on the reverse of one of Chosroe's coins.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P7"/>[7] In
    chapter two, by far the longest of the four, Baum carefully
    weaves the fragments of historical information on Shirin into a
    larger narrative on the couple, Chosroe II and Shirin, aided in
    such an effort by the good fortune of having available an
    incomparably larger resort of data on the husband and king of
    kings than on the wife and queen (of queens). Having come to
    power in the context of a revolt of general Bahram Cobin
    against his father Hormizd IV, Chosroe II gained the throne in
    590, not completely cleared of any doubts concerning his
    potential involvement in his father's murder. Chosroe II is
    reported to have spoken of himself as "being among the gods the
    good and eternal human being, among humans the most respected
    of gods, ..., the victorious one, who rises with the sun, ...
    [who] would rule over the other worlds, if they existed." Yet
    accompanied by two wives, children, and Persian nobles, Chosroe
    had to take to flight in the face of his general's troops.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P8"/>[8] Baum
    notes that the wives who accompanied him are not identified by
    name. According to Theophylact, who relied upon the historical
    work of John of Epiphaneia, a personal acquaintance of Chosroe
    II's, the women were still nursing their children when fleeing
    to Hierapolis/Mabbug. Some ancient sources supply more details
    concerning these wives. Firdausi claims that Chosroe had been
    married to the east Syrian Christian Shirin already before his
    flight to Byzantium. Pseudo-Sebeos mentions Khuzistan in
    south-west Iran as her place of origin. The <hi rend="italic">Syriac
    Chronicle</hi> speaks of her as "Aramaean," a label used for
    inhabitants of the Kufa region in northern Iraq. Later legend
    turned her into a servant at the home of a Persian family with
    whom Chosroe had visited regularly during his youth. For the
    reader interested in the story's value for the reconstruction
    of women's history, it is worth mentioning Baum's observation
    that according to her early seventh-century <hi rend="italic">Life</hi>,
    Chosroe II met Saint Golanduch in Hierapolis during the latter
    part of 590 or at the latest during the first few days of
    591.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P9"/>[9] While it
    is unlikely that Chosroe II ever made it to the court of the
    Byzantine emperor in Constantinople, Maurice nevertheless was
    to decide to whom of the two Persian opponents he would lend
    his support. Despite the smaller offers in the form of land and
    money which Chosroe had to give, Maurice favored Chosroe, whom
    he adopted as "son." Both parties needed and thus obtained
    peace: Maurice in order to handle the pressure he experienced
    from the Avars and Slavs from the North, and Chosroe to deal
    with internal strife that had arisen in Persia.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P10"/>[10] Baum
    does not consider explicitly, whether the circumstance of
    Chosroe's adoption into Maurice's royal family may have given
    rise to the myth of Mary, a legendary daughter of Emperor
    Maurice, supposedly becoming one of the wives in Chosroe's
    harem. Extremely unlikely as the identification of Mary as a
    daughter of the Byzantine emperor is, as Baum rightly points
    out, it is possible that Chosroe may have had a Greek woman
    named Mary among his concubines. The ancient sources explicitly
    state that Chosroe's oldest son Shiroe (Kavad) was not the son
    of Shirin. Rather, at Chosroe's deposition from his throne,
    Shirin maneuvered to have her own son, Merdanshah, win the
    throne. Thus it is not clear, as Baum remarks, whether Shirin
    was Chosroe's concubine or already his wife on his flight to
    Byzantium in 590.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P11"/>[11]
    Later Arabic commentators identified Mary with Shirin. Firdausi
    seems to have invented the motif of Shirin poisoning Mary. One
    notes that that motif thus is introduced 400 years after the
    alleged event took place. Moreover, Chosroe most likely never
    reached Constantinople, and thus a marriage to the emperor's
    daughter would have been even less likely. With or without
    giving his daughter into marriage to Chosroe, Maurice supported
    his subsequent military campaign against Bahram. Having brought
    his wives to Sanjar for their protection, Chosroe and his loyal
    generals fought and won the battle.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P12"/>[12] The
    oldest extant document regarding the history of Shirin is a
    letter written by Chosroe in 591 to the sanctuary of the martyr
    Sergius of Resafa in Syria. The letter is preserved in Evagrius
    Scholasticus's <hi rend="italic">Church History</hi>. It does not mention
    Shirin, but witnesses to Chosroe's gift of two golden crosses
    to the sanctuary in honor of the martyr. Between 591 and 593
    Chosroe sent several sets of crosses, golden plates, and money
    for liturgical vessels to St. Sergius's <hi rend="italic">martyrion</hi>. It
    was also during this time that he married the Christian girl
    Shirin, against the laws of his own country, but out of great
    love for her, as Chosroe himself had stated on an inscription
    on one of the golden plates. Shirin became queen of queens.
    Some of the gifts to St. Sergius's sanctuary were votive
    offerings, requesting that Shirin might become pregnant through
    the saint's intercession. Her first child, probably a girl,
    seems to have been born before the turn of 593/594. It is to
    about that time that the coins referred to above are to be
    dated that show Chosroe's image, crowned and with the crescent,
    on the recto. The verso shows a woman's head, interpreted
    either as Shirin's image or that of the goddess Anahit.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P13"/>[13] The
    royal couple exercised influence upon the affairs of the
    Apostolic Church of the East. After the death of Catholics
    Ishoyahb I in 596 A.D., the bishops elected the monk Sabrisho,
    bishop of Lasum and a favorite of Shirin's and Chosroe's, as
    new Catholicos. The bishops seem to have met for the election
    in a synod, held in Shirin's palace, and it was her vote that
    decided in favor of Sabrisho. One day after the election, and
    at the occasion of a visit between Chosroe and the new
    Catholicos, the King of Kings is reported to have received the
    Eucharist from Sabrisho's hands.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P14"/>[14] As
    Catholicos, Sabrisho continued to live the strict ascetic life
    he had become accustomed to. His high standing at Chosroe's
    court clearly benefited his Church. Sabrisho frequently visited
    Shirin's palace, also because he was her spiritual father. At
    those occasions he met Chosroe quite regularly. Yet against the
    catholicos's explicit instructions, Shirin suggested
    individuals, who practiced polygamy, for public offices under
    Chosroe. On the other hand, Shirin supported Sabrisho's efforts
    at building monasteries in 598, including one in Ctesiphon that
    was to be named after her. Chosroe appears to have financed the
    building of churches for his wife's sake, especially three
    churches dedicated respectively to the Virgin Mary, to the
    Apostles, and to the Martyr Sergius.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P15"/>[15] At
    the death of Catholicos Sabrisho in 604, Shirin again
    influenced the election of the new catholicos, Gregory of
    Phrat, a man who came from Khuzistan, Shirin's likely place of
    origin. This time, Shirin succeeded with her chosen candidate
    even against Chosroe's will and again against the will of all
    the bishops. Shirin rejected the majority candidate because of
    his outspoken opposition to the bigamy of her physician Gabriel
    of Singar. Under Gabriel's influence Shirin turned to the
    West-Syrian Church, i.e., that branch of the Syrian Church
    which had refrained from accepting the Council of Chalcedon
    (451 A.D.). Her monastic foundation in Ctesiphon followed her
    example. Subsequent to 609, the West Syrian Church appears to
    have enjoyed increased favor with the Persian government.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P16"/>[16]
    Chosroe's support of the so-called "Synod of the Persians"
    reflects attempts on the part of the king of kings to create a
    unified Christian Church in his new, significantly enlarged
    empire. Shirin's and her physician Gabriel's influence led to
    disputes between members of the West-Syrian and East-Syrian
    Church. Shirin's growing distance from the Church of the East
    can be measured in Chosroe's refusal to appoint any new
    Catholicos for the Church of the East until they would agree to
    reject the teachings of Nestorius.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P17"/>[17]
    Shirin and Chosroe's turn to the West-Syrian Church also
    facilitated the collaboration of Armenia with Persia. Under
    Chosroe's rule, Christians seem to have been able to live in
    Armenia without restriction on the practice of their faith.
    Shirin's change of religious allegiance is also reflected in
    the documentation of her influence in ecclesiastical sources.
    Texts by authors of the Apostolic Church of the East no longer
    mentioned the name of the queen, who formerly had extended her
    patronage to them. Anti-Chalcedonian authors, however, like the
    Armenian Pseudo-Sebeos, speak of her as the "pious queen." In
    the end, Shirin, who had originated from the Apostolic Church
    of the East, was to conclude her life as an adherent of the
    West-Syrian Church. Long before that, after the Persian
    conquest of Jerusalem in May 614, the relic of the True Cross
    was brought to Ctesiphon and there was handed over into
    Shirin's hands, who seems to have treated it with utmost
    respect and veneration.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P18"/>[18]
    Towards the end of Chosroe's reign, a certain estrangement
    seems to have developed between Chosroe and the West-Syrian
    Church. During the last few years of Chosroe's reign,
    Christians like Anastasius the Persian suffered martyrdom. This
    circumstance also reflects a wider Christian opposition to
    Chosroe at the time. All in all, the Christians seemed to have
    welcomed his downfall in the end. The end dawned when Chosroe's
    attack against Constantinople was unsuccessful. Baum refers to
    the customary dating of the first singing of the famous
    Akathistos Hymn at the initiative of Patriarch Sergius of
    Constantinople in 626 in celebration of the protection of the
    city against the Persians. A recent study of this hymn (Leena
    Mari Peltomaa, <hi rend="italic">The Image of the Virgin Mary in the
    Akathistos Hymn</hi>, The Medieval Mediterranean 35 [Brill
    Academic Publishers, 2001]) which situates its origins in the
    immediate aftermath of the Council of Ephesus (431 A.D.), would
    have to be taken into account.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P19"/>[19] The
    sources which provide plenty of information regarding military
    activities between the Byzantine and Persian rulers, do not
    report any further details about Shirin or her involvement in
    state and church affairs for the time in between her reception
    of the True Cross in 614 and the final military campaign of
    Emperor Herakleios against Chosroe in 628. She reappears only
    at the moment when Herakleios approached Ctesiphon and Chosroe
    attempted to find protection for his wife and their three
    daughters. Yet at that occasion, Shirin also did not manage to
    have her son Merdanshah appointed as his father's successor.
    Rather, Chosroe's older son Kavad, upon Herakleios's command,
    murdered his half-brothers in front of his father's eyes and
    eventually also his father on February 28, 628. As new King of
    Kings, Kavad re-established support for the interests of the
    Apostolic Church of the East, yet not for long. He died that
    same year.</p>

    Eventually, one of Chosroe's daughters, Boran, took over the
    rule. Some sources speculate that Shirin may have poisoned
    Kavad in revenge for his murder of her son Merdanshah. One
    notices with Baum that sources from authors of the Apostolic
    Church of the East speculate about Shirin as someone who quite
    frequently used deadly potions to rid herself of enemies. Given
    her turn to the West-Syrian, anti-Chalcedonian Church, authors
    from her former East Syrian Church community no longer showed
    any sympathies for her. Other ancient authors thought that
    after Chosroe's death Shirin might have been motivated to
    commit suicide to avoid having to join Kavad's harem. Persian
    and Arabic writers later on were to pick up this motif. The
    True Cross, which had been under Shirin's guardianship,
    returned to Jerusalem in 630 or 631, and then, sometime between
    633 and 635, was brought to Constantinople.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P21"/>[21]
    Sources contemporary to Shirin's own time do not inform about
    her death. The Persian expanded translation of at-Tabari's
    historical work is the first to introduce the motif of a love
    relationship between Shirin and Ferhad, supposedly one of
    Chosroe's architects. The only source on Shirin's death is
    Firdausi's <hi rend="italic">Shahname</hi>, information from which is less
    reliable insofar as it cannot be tested against other texts, as
    Baum notes. According to this Persian national epic, Shirin
    committed suicide directly at Chosroe's tomb.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P22"/>[22]
    European chronicles and romances developed individual ones of
    the figures connected with the Shirin-material in the course of
    the first half of the second millennium. The Persian king
    Chosroe's bloody death was presented as a punishment for his
    rejection of Christianity. The Byzantine Emperor Herakleios
    turned into the archetype of the Christian ruler and crusader.
    Shirin disappeared and crusader. Shirin disappeared Islamic
    lore. Here Shirin's myth was developed by authors who
    emphasized her as the archetype of pure love, while any
    Christian traces of her character were completely omitted.
    Motivated by anti-Iranian elements, early Islamic literature
    also saw in Chosroe the prototype of the unjust king.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P23"/>[23] In
    chapter three, Baum treats this later reception history of the
    Shirin myth in literature and the arts, both of the East and of
    the West. Christian authors almost completely forgot about
    Shirin. The last one to mention her name was the East Syrian
    church historian Amr ibn Matta in the 14<hi rend="sup">th</hi> century.
    Islamic works, however, began to develop Shirin's story already
    one hundred years after her death. Geographers described Kasr-i
    Shirin, the palace near Bisotun, Iran, attributed to her. Love
    poetry on the walls of this palace appears to have survived for
    at least three centuries after Shirin's death. Early reliefs,
    depicting scenes with Chosroe's horse Shabdiz, may also picture
    Shirin, yet merely in a subordinate role. It is worthy of note
    that again here, as on Chosroe's coins mentioned above, Shirin
    and the goddess Anahit seem to melt into one.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P24"/>[24] It
    is in the work of the Persian author Abu Ali Muham(m)ad Balami,
    who in the tenth century adapted at-Tabari's annals into
    Persian, that one finds the beginnings of the story of the love
    relationship between Chosroe's legendary architect Ferhad and
    Shirin. Nizami's <hi rend="italic">Chosroe and Shirin</hi> clearly developed
    that part of the story as an etiology that fit the rock relief
    of Taq-i Bustan in Kermanshah, Iran. Frankish accounts from the
    seventh century, which turned Shirin into a queen who begged
    Patriarch John of Constantinople to baptize her and who made
    her return to her husband dependent upon his conversion to the
    Christian faith and baptism, likely reflect reminiscences of
    the Frankish King Clovis's baptism and the role of his
    Christian wife, Clothilde.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P25"/>[25]
    Middle Persian literature at the turn of the millennium,
    especially Firdausi's <hi rend="italic">Shahname</hi>, dealt with Shirin,
    without mentioning her affiliation with the Apostolic Church of
    the East, while otherwise adhering quite closely to the
    historical facts. Firdausi did not have any interest in Shirin
    as such, but rather wanted to write a history of Persia. Thus
    he felt free to treat her merely as a minor figure at the
    margins.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P26"/>[26] The
    <hi rend="italic">Shahname</hi> and Nizami's <hi rend="italic">Chosroe and Shirin</hi>
    became the main sources for all later renditions of the
    Shirin-material in the Middle and Far East. Miniature paintings
    of individual scenes in manuscripts contributed significantly
    to the spread of Shirin's story. Also, the great popularity of
    Nizami's rendering in the twelfth century aided the wide
    dissemination of the material. Vizier Nezam al-Molk (died in
    1092) thought that Chosroe II's excessive sexual contact with
    other women in his harem might have driven Shirin into Ferhad's
    arms. Yet Nizami, who used parts of al-Molk's works,
    reinterpreted the Shirin-myth into an archetypal
    love-story.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P27"/>[27]
    Despite the wide popularity of Shirin's story, during the 1001
    nights when Shehrazas told her many tales to the king, only
    once did she include a story about Shirin: that of Chosroe,
    Shirin, and the fisherman, narrated during the 390<hi rend="sup">th</hi>
    night. Moreover, that tale portrayed Shirin in an unfavourable
    light, as a stingy wife whose advice a husband should never
    follow. One may ascribe such a poor treatment to the wider
    neglect of Persian stories in the work, as Baum explains. Yet a
    reader is also left to wonder, whether other selection
    criteria, perhaps a motive of envy between female figures or a
    reflection of the attitudes of some male members of the
    audience who desired not only to be entertained by pleasing
    love stories, but also wished their chauvinistic sense of
    superiority to be cultivated, may have played a role. A
    specialist's gender-focused investigation of this world-famous
    collection of tales might bring some clarification to this
    question.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P28"/>[28]
    Nizami's <hi rend="italic">Chosroe and Shirin</hi> was one of the most widely
    read works of medieval Islamic literature. Completed around
    1200, this verse epic incorporated at-Tabari's and Firdausi's
    works and folk traditions about Shirin. In it, Nizami also
    projected features of his first wife, Apak, who died at a young
    age, onto the figure of Shirin. Nizami, it is worthy of note,
    presented Shirin as a Christian. In his work, moreover, Shirin
    is the niece of an Armenian queen named Mahin Banu. Her aunt
    warned the young girl of Chosroe's excessive sexual appetite,
    for the satiation of which he kept a harem of 10,000 women.
    Thus Shirin heeded to her aunt's advice and insisted upon
    marriage when Chosroe pursued her. The wedding, however, only
    took place after escapades on Chosroe's part, including one
    with the girl Shakkar ("Sugar") in Isfahan, Iran. Chosroe's
    son, Shiroe, desiring to marry Shirin as well, murdered his
    father and Shirin committed suicide, while bending herself over
    Chosroe's corpse. Nizami concluded his poem on a proselytising
    motif, telling of a dream appearance of Muhammed to Chosroe in
    which the prophet advised the king to convert to Islam.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P29"/>[29] As
    the Muslims expanded into Northern India, Shirin's story
    travelled along with them as part of Persian culture being
    cultivated at the ruler's court. Amir Chosroe Dihlavi retold
    the story, based on Nizami, but modified details. The architect
    Ferhad, who became an integral part of the narrative, was
    introduced as a son of the emperor of China. Chosroe was killed
    in a revolt at his palace and Shirin, again, committed suicide.
    Nizami, however, had had both Chosroe and Shirin die in
    prison.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P30"/>[30] In
    the course of the 14<hi rend="sup">th</hi> century, Nizami's work found
    reception also among the Turks, whose upper classes used the
    Persian language in Asia Minor. Nizami's work was translated
    several times into Turkish, with some translations adapting the
    story to motifs of Turkish popular poetry. Individual
    translators, like Fahreddin Yakub ben Muhammed, called Fahri,
    expanded Nizami's work by incorporating significant portions of
    Firdausi's <hi rend="italic">Shahname</hi>, without always integrating the
    narrative and smoothly adjusting transitions. The translator
    Sinaneddin Yusuf, known as Seyhi, shortened Nizami's
    <hi rend="italic">Vorlage</hi> in places and polished his integration of
    material from the <hi rend="italic">Shahname</hi> more appropriately. His was
    a widely read translation.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P31"/>[31] The
    reception history of the Shirin-material in the
    Turkish-speaking realm evinces its own contributions. Ali Shir
    Navai, who died in 1501, worked out a new recension of the myth
    in 1483/85, entitled <hi rend="italic">Ferhad and Shirin</hi>, in which now
    Ferhad holds center stage. Again Ferhad is introduced as the
    son of the Chinese emperor and Shirin is the niece of the
    Armenian queen, yet newly introduced additional motives include
    a journey to Greece with a visit to Socrates, a miraculous
    mirror, love between Ferhad and Shirin that renders both
    unconscious, love letters between the two, Shirin's death now
    next to Ferhad's corpse, and two hermits spending their lives
    next to the tomb of the two tragic lovers. Ali Shir Navai thus
    created the prototype of a love story which remained popular
    into the twentieth century in Usbekistan, and in translation
    even among speakers of Russian.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P32"/>[32]
    Towards the end of the Middle Ages and under the successors of
    Tamerlane the city of Herat turned into a center of new
    versions of the myth surrounding Shirin both in literature and
    the arts. After 1506, the center of the Shirin reception
    definitively moved to India. Among some poets, the contours of
    the figures of the Shirin story dissolved and Shirin at times
    existed merely as a lyric expression, representing the
    archetype of love in words, and nothing else.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P33"/>[33] The
    Shirin-motif eventually also found entrance into Turkish shadow
    plays and reentered Christian literature in Georgia, e.g., in
    the form of the <hi rend="italic">Khosrovshiriniani</hi>, a popular Georgian
    version of Amir Chosroe Dihlavi's <hi rend="italic">Shirin and Chosroe</hi>.
    Nizami's work finally came to the attention of the European
    audience in 1697 in Paris.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P34"/>[34]
    Concluding his work in chapter four, Baum discusses the details
    of the rediscovery of the Shirin-motif at the hands of the
    Austrian Orientalist Josef von Hammer-Purgstall and its
    influence on German literature, especially on Johann Wolfgang
    von Goethe. At the end of the 18<hi rend="sup">th</hi> century,
    Hammer-Purgstall composed a version of Shirin's story and
    published early excerpts of it in the journal "Neuer Teutscher
    Merkur." Although the publication of his verse recreations of
    oriental poetry in book-format was delayed for years,
    Hammer-Purgstall is to be credited with having mediated to the
    West one of the Orient's most famous love stories. Goethe
    studied his writings with great interest. For him, Shirin was
    what he called a "Musterbild" (i.e., ideal) of love. Baum
    comments that C. G. Jung was to call that type of figure
    "archetype" later on.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P35"/>[35] Even
    in the course of the twentieth century, the Shirin motif is
    reworked in the arts, including a film-script for "The Shah of
    Iran and the Banu of Armenia" by the Iranian author Debih
    Behruz; the theater play "Ferhad and Shirin" by the Turkish
    poet Nazim Hikmet, written in 1947 and performed in Berlin in
    1983; and the orchestra performance of "Songs of Shirin" by the
    composer Gerhard Müller-Hornbach (Frankfurt a. M.,
    1982).</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P36"/>[36] Baum
    is to be applauded for his work which brings to light the
    fullest account of details of the life of an Eastern Christian
    woman, who in the sources is at times named as an individual,
    and who at other times remains merely an unnamed marginal
    figure. Modern scholarship in related disciplines has shown the
    great value that a more careful reading of the sources such as
    Baum's can have, especially when it pays attention to both
    named and unnamed women. Recent works in the field of biblical
    studies (e.g., Carol Meyers, Toni Craven, and Ross Kraemer,
    eds., <hi rend="italic">Women in Scripture: A Dictionary of Named and Unnamed
    Women in the Hebrew Bible, the Apocryphal/Deuterocanonical
    Books, and the New Testament</hi> [Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing
    Company, 2001]; or several of the publications by Irmtraud
    Fischer, a Biblical scholar from Austria) document and
    illustrate the vast amount of data that thus is to be gained
    even from foundational, widely studied texts. Baum's work
    contributes towards the goal of bringing such concerns to bear
    fruit also in the composition of scholarly works in eastern
    Church History. He contributes significantly to this larger
    project, certainly with regard to Shirin, the main topic of the
    study. Whether or not Baum also pursued the goal of
    contributing to the reconstruction of women's history in a way
    that goes beyond his concern for Shirin is a different
    question.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P37"/>[37] At
    times, the reader is startled when she notices that Baum
    constructs his historical narrative unnecessarily by reference
    primarily to male participants and that he identifies women by
    reference to their relationships to male partners or relatives,
    both in instances where the historical names of such women is
    known and even where the woman in question clearly is the
    active subject of the sentence (e.g., p. 26). Attention to such
    details of composition also on the level of Baum's own
    narrative might have helped to tone down the impression that
    remains rather prominent in the reader's mind after having
    finished the book, namely that Shirin is merely a thinner layer
    onto the life of Chosroe II. The book does not intend to be a
    biography of Chosroe II, a work which as Baum rightly notes (p.
    10) is still missing. Whoever will undertake such a project in
    the future will do well to take Baum's study into account. Yet
    while reading chapters one and two, one wonders if a title that
    referenced the couple, and not only Shirin, might have been
    more appropriate.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P38"/>[38]
    Chapters three and four refocus the reader's attention
    significantly. By way of short summaries of the main points of
    content of individual authors' treatment of the Shirin
    material, Baum manages to have Shirin's name appear more
    frequently on the page. Thus she is allowed to claim more space
    in the imagination of the reader, certainly helped by the
    reader being able to view depictions of her on color plates
    almost right at the beginning of chapter three. Thus, in the
    end for the reader the balance is tipped again in favor of
    seeing the book as one that treats indeed Shirin and her story,
    and the reader goes away with a sense of gratitude to Baum for
    having brought her back to life.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P39"/>[39]
    Especially in the first two chapters of the work where it is
    most relevant, Baum shows a welcome sensitivity to ecumenical
    concerns regarding the use of accurate language when speaking
    of the various eastern Christian churches. Employing quotation
    marks, he often indicates that terms like "Monophysites"
    ("Monophysiten") or "Nestorians" ("Nestorianer") originated in
    and reflect a polemical context and do not represent the
    self-understanding of the respective Christian Churches
    themselves. Yet his awareness of the problem does not lead him
    to draw the full consequence of that insight and discontinue
    completely the use of such terms, even if especially marked, in
    his text. Also the application of the term "orthodox"
    exclusively to members of the Byzantine Orthodox Church
    requires a justification, which the volume does not supply.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P40"/>[40] In
    addition to text and endnotes, the volume offers a
    chronological table, covering events between 531 (beginning of
    the rule of Chosroe I) to 651 (death of Yezdegerd III, the last
    Persian King of Kings); a list of references to 93 manuscripts
    and individual pages containing illustrations with scenes from
    Shirin's life with very helpful identifications of the content
    of the scene that is being depicted; a list of additional
    manuscripts of the relevant works of Nizami, Firdausi, Amir
    Chosroe Dihlavi, Ali Shir Navai, Fahreddin Yakub ben Muhammed
    (or "Mehmed"), and Seyhi Yusuf Sinan that apparently do not
    contain illustrations of Shirin-scenes; a bibliography of
    primary and secondary literature; a postscript; a map; as well
    as an incomplete list of people mentioned in the book (e.g.,
    Gregory of Phart is not listed), with subsets of lists of
    Catholicoi of the East, Popes, Persian Kings of Kings, and
    Roman and Byzantine emperors.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P41"/>[41] The
    publisher, kitab Verlag, has produced a well-illustrated
    volume. The color reproductions of two pages of Byzantine and
    Persian coins, one photo of the Taq-i Bustan rock relief, and
    13 plates of miniature paintings, taken from manuscripts now
    preserved in London, Berlin, Washington D.C., and Istanbul,
    greatly enrich the presentation. Greater accuracy in
    proofreading the volume (e.g., p. 10, l. 7: read "Matenadaran"

    p. 89, l. 4: read "Handlung" instead of "Handlungs"; pp. 86,
    89, and 90: a unified transliteration ["Hamse" vs. "Khamsa"]
    would be desirable for the benefit of non-specialist readers to
    whom this book seems to be pitched in the first place; p. 90,
    l. 7 from the bottom: read "Dichter" instead of "Maler";
    unified transliteration of foreign names throughout is
    desirable, e.g., either "Dihlawi" [e.g., prior to p. 100, as
    well as in the "Personenregister"] or "Dihlavi" [e.g., on p.
    100 and in ch. 4]) would have been worth the effort.</p>

    Despite the usual scarcity of information available on women in
    general and Christian women in particular in late antique and
    early Islamic times, and furthermore significantly impeded by
    the tremendous loss of source material on Christians in the
    East, especially here because of the near extinction of the
    records of the Church of the East, Wilhelm Baum has succeeded
    in drawing a richly nuanced picture of an impressive and
    influential woman, who through her position at the court,
    dedicated love to her husband, Christian commitment, and
    certainly also through her beauty has influenced affairs in
    historic times, inspired writers throughout the centuries, and
    moved audiences both in the East and in the West. The lightly
    annotated volume will be of interest to students and scholars
    in the fields of Oriental Studies, the reception history of
    Oriental literature, Religious Studies, Byzantine Studies,
    Eastern Church History, Women's Studies, and several other
    disciplines, including studies in German literature. The wider
    accessibility of the work in English translation (published
    recently as Wilhelm Baum, <hi rend="italic">Shirin: Christian-Queen-Myth of
    Love. A Woman of Late Antiquity: Historical Reality and
    Literary Effect</hi> [Gorgias Press, 2004], which could not be
    consulted for this review) might even allow one to consider the
    book for supplementary reading in advanced undergraduate or
    graduate courses.</p>

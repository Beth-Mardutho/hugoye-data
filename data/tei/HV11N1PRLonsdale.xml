         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P1"/>[1] The
    invitation to review this book was accepted with some
    trepidation; half of the topics mentioned in the title were
    quite familiar, but the others less so. Fortunately, the
    editors’ goal was to build a conceptual and
    methodological bridge between two disciplines, and reading the
    book was very much an experience in leaving behind comfortable
    territory and crossing over into unfamiliar realms. Ultimately
    the traversal was successful, enlightening, and
    perspective-enhancing, and was punctuated with only occasional
    desires to climb over the railing and jump or otherwise
    escape.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P2"/>[2] This
    review is written from the perspective of one who is a
    computational linguist with extensive experience in corpus
    development as well as translation theory and practice, having
    a good knowledge of biblical Hebrew and a growing acquaintance
    with Syriac, but with very little knowledge of (albeit
    increasing interest in) textual criticism and exegesis. Anyone
    who shares any subset (or superset) of these interests will
    find the book compelling, though those with narrow specialties
    will find themselves correspondingly stretched.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P3"/>[3] The
    content includes, and extends, material presented at a seminar
    held in the Netherlands in 2003 that focused on the
    Computer-Assisted Linguistic Analysis of the Peshitta (CALAP)
    project. Evidently the effort combines two teams, one
    specializing in the development of computational tools for
    Hebrew, then Syriac, linguistic analysis (WIVU), and the other
    (PIL) with a history of analyzing the Peshitta from text
    historical, critical, exegetical, and translation-theoretic
    perspectives. The attempt to unify these two traditionally
    separate undertakings under one umbrella effort seemed
    initially to this reader an intriguing but Herculean (pardon
    the pagan reference!) task. The body of the text is intended to
    convince the skeptical, and for this reader it did.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P4"/>[4] The
    first chapter is a wonderful 30-page survey of the motivating
    factors for the project: to create a truly interdisciplinary
    approach—complete with the requisite tools—to
    linguistic and textual analysis, and to illustrate its
    usefulness with a nontrivial application (no less than the
    Peshitta). A broad discussion of such topics as the document
    itself, linguistic factors in Old Testament exegesis,
    synchronic vs. diachronic analyses, translation theory, the
    cultural context of language(s), language use, and stylistics
    lays the linguistic groundwork for this effort. A brief
    overview of relevant manuscripts and other texts sets the focus
    on the target of the approach. This enjoyable chapter could
    serve very well as a standalone tutorial on this constellation
    of topics.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P5"/>[5] The next
    40-page chapter includes a technical description of the
    computational approach that WIVU used in annotating the
    Biblical Hebrew data, and how their methods were adapted for
    processing the linguistic content of Syriac text. The
    discussion is replete with data listings that may be
    intimidating to some, but the narrative is expertly crafted to
    help initiate the non-computational to the myriad of levels of
    analysis, descriptive labels and features, and processing
    stages that the text is subjected to. The formatting and layout
    of the data examples is impressive and very readable, and the
    technology described is noteworthy, if not well documented so
    far in the usual computational linguistics publication venues
    elsewhere.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P6"/>[6] The
    balance of the first third of the book consists of several
    chapters laying out the technical issues involving the tools
    development effort, linguistic analysis conventions, and
    annotation schemes. These will be of interest to anyone
    undertaking similar linguistic annotation projects, or
    specialists who will someday use such tools. After accessible
    discussions by project members on these topics, responses by
    others raise issues about coverage, evaluation, ambiguity,
    overall project goals, assumptions about linguistic theory, and
    the tensions about empirical versus rational analyses. The
    discussion is informative and interesting.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P7"/>[7] The next
    third of the book involves two back-and-forth dialogues and
    highlights the role that CALAP’s offerings can play in
    these discussions. The first centers on a syntactic issue, that
    of nominal clauses and the role of the enclitic personal
    pronoun. An introductory chapter summarizes three prevailing
    approaches, and then the proponent of each responds in
    subsequent chapters. The discussion is interesting for its
    linguistic implications, but too involved to mention further
    here. The topics involve such current issues as predication,
    clitics, and definiteness. Linguists looking for language data
    to sound out various theoretical approaches to morphosyntax
    will find a treasure trove in this exchange. The second
    discussion illustrates questions germane to the other side of
    the “bridge”, that of analyzing textual variants.
    The issue at hand is where the Targum and the Peshitta agree
    and diverge, with respect to each other and to the MT. The
    investigation was, again, very carefully written and was
    perfectly tractable to this reader, who was now in largely
    unfamiliar territory. One of the respondents points out the
    problem—independently apparent to this reader as
    well—that no mention was made in this latter study of how
    the CALAP material was used, though clearly it was to some
    degree.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P8"/>[8] The last
    third of the book answers the question so often posed to corpus
    developers by potential end-users: “Now that I have the
    corpus, what can I do with it?” To this end a nine-verse
    passage in 1 Kings 2 is strategically chosen to illustrate the
    possibilities that an extensively annotated corpus provides to
    researchers. A wide array of perspectives is applied in viewing
    the contents of the text in these verses from formalist and
    functionalist angles, and the result is an impressive
    illustration of CALAP’s capabilities (as well as a few of
    its shortcomings). An epilogue serves to reiterate how well the
    interdisciplinary approach bridges the interests of a wide
    range of researchers.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P9"/>[9] One has
    the impression that in some aspects of CALAP’s
    technology, the 2003 snapshot we are given can be updated (and
    perhaps it has): there is no mention of current topics such as
    best practices in corpus annotation, morphological parsing
    tools could be analyzed in a more versatile way using
    finite-state technologies, statistical analyses could be a
    little more developed, and machine learning is more viable in
    corpus annotation work today. Still, the theoretical and
    methodological work is sound, even solid, and the
    demonstrations of its effectiveness are impressive.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P10"/>[10]
    Finally, some low-level remarks are perhaps in order. The text
    is replete with examples, quotes, data, and footnotes in
    several languages, and therefore assumes some familiarity on
    the part of the reader with French, German, Italian, Greek,
    Latin, Slavic, and (naturally) Semitic languages. A superb work
    was performed in editing such a complicated text; only a dozen
    or so errors, mostly in English spelling, were detected.
    Reflecting the bipartite nature of this text, some chapters had
    their extensive citations, footnotes, and textual apparata
    notated at the bottom of each page, which to this reader was a
    little unwieldy; the others had this material at the end of
    each chapter.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P11"/>[11]
    Overall, this book is a remarkable work and will stand as one
    of the memorable examples of how to design, implement,
    successfully realize, and document a large-scale, multi-layered
    linguistic development project. It also serves as a model of
    how to build an interdisciplinary bridge across theoretical and
    methodological gaps that need to be addressed if we are to
    better appreciate language and its use.</p>

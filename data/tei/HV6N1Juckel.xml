            <p>The article offers a collation of the
    5th/6th cent. Peshitta Gospel manuscript known as 'Codex
    Phillipps 1388' with the standard text of the Peshitta Gospels
    published by Ph.E. Pusey/G.H. Gwilliam in 1901. The purpose is
    to re-examine the collation of the same codex presented by the
    German scholar A. Allgeier in 1932 and to establish its
    relation to the 'Old Syriac' and to early Peshitta manuscripts.
    The result is that 'Codex Phillipps' is not a singular
    (Allgeier) but a typical (Black) early Peshitta manuscript. All
    early Gospel manuscripts should be examined to trace their
    individually developped 'Old Syriac heritage'.</p>

         <head xml:id="HV6N1Juckel3">The Background</head>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P1"/>[1] This
    re-examination of ‘Codex Phillipps 1388’<ref target="#FN1">1</ref> resumes
    the work of Arthur Allgeier, who seventy years ago was the
    first to introduce this 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi>/6<hi rend="sup">th</hi>-century
    Gospel manuscript<ref target="#FN2">2</ref> (held at the <hi rend="italic">Staatsbibliothek,</hi> Berlin) to
    scholarly discussion<ref target="#FN3">3</ref>. Collating the codex with the text of the
    Peshitta Gospels published by E. Ph. Pusey and G. H. Gwilliam
    in 1901, Allgeier’s intention was to point to its
    significance for the history of the Peshitta text. According to
    him, ‘Codex Phillipps’ is the only known Peshitta
    manuscript which shares a significant number of readings with
    the ‘Old Syriac’ Gospel text, thus attesting a
    transition stage between the ‘Old Syriac’ and the
    Peshitta. Discussing only two sample passages (Jn xiii.17 and
    Jn xviii.16) to set out this view in some detail,
    Allgeier’s primary concern was to resume the question of
    a revisional history of the Peshitta Gospels, which was
    answered in the negative by G. H. Gwilliam in an article of
    1891<ref target="#FN4">4</ref>. But meanwhile the reopening of this question
    had been effected by the discovery (1892) and successive
    publication (1894, 1896, 1910) of the ‘Old Syriac’
    Sinaitic manuscript, by the improved republication of the
    ‘Old Syriac’ Curetonian manuscript by F.C. Burkitt
    (1904), and by Gwilliam’s splendid edition of the
    Peshitta Gospels (1901). All these publications had created new
    conditions for the discussion about the ‘Old
    Syriac’ Gospels<ref target="#FN5">5</ref> and about the <hi rend="italic">early</hi> Peshitta text.
    Allgeier continued this line to add further manuscript evidence
    by introducing ‘Codex Phillipps’.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P2"/>[2] In the
    history of research attention was paid to the codex during the
    re-examination of F.C. Burkitt’s influential
    hypothesis<ref target="#FN6">6</ref> on the origin of the Peshitta text by A.
    Vööbus, which finally resulted in a modification of
    this hypothesis by M. Black. Burkitt’s view, that it was
    Rabbula (bishop of Edessa 411-435) who introduced the Peshitta
    to Eastern Christianity by revising and thus replacing the
    Gospels of ‘Old Syriac’ text type, Vööbus
    contested by continuous efforts to display evidence for the
    maintenance (and even dominance) of the ‘Old
    Syriac’ side by side with the Peshitta until the end of
    the 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> century<ref target="#FN7">7</ref>. In this contest, ‘Codex
    Phillipps’ became the model of an ‘Old
    Syriac’-influenced manuscript, which directed
    Vööbus’ research for additional representatives
    of this text type<ref target="#FN8">8</ref>. Vööbus found fault with
    Gwilliam’s Gospel edition for not sufficiently
    considering the ‘Old Syriac’ elements within the
    Peshitta manuscripts, thus neglecting it for the constitution
    of the text to print<ref target="#FN9">9</ref>. Black too recognized the neglection of the
    ‘Old Syriac’ element in Gwilliam’s
    edition<ref target="#FN10">10</ref>, but acknowledged it as a result of Gwilliams
    editorial policy<ref target="#FN11">11</ref>. Guided by ‘Codex Phillipps’,
    Black drew attention to variants already quoted in
    Gwilliam’s Gospel volume, which agree with the ‘Old
    Syriac’ manuscripts against the traditional Peshitta text
    in the same way ‘Codex Phillipps’ does. These
    variants he assessed to be remnants of a Peshitta text earlier
    than the one printed in Gwilliam’s volume, represented
    but not yet sufficiently identified in its <hi rend="italic">apparatus
    criticus</hi>. According to Black it was this earlier Peshitta
    text (the ‘pre-Peshitta, i.e., the Old Syriac basis of
    the Syriac Vulgate’<ref target="#FN12">12</ref>) Rabbula introduced by revising
    the ‘Old Syriac’ Gospels.</p>
         <head xml:id="HV6N1Juckel4">The Presentation of the Variants</head>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P3"/>[3] The
    primary fundamental concern of Allgeier’s article leaves
    it unsatisfactory with regard to the details. Neither is the
    collation of the codex complete, nor its relation to the
    ‘Old Syriac’ and Peshitta manuscripts sufficiently
    set out. Therefore, to give a more detailed presentation of the
    textual evidence preserved in ‘Codex Phillipps’ is
    the concern of this re-examination. This presentation is
    inspired by M. Black, who offered a sound method to determine
    not only the individually developed 'Old Syriac' heritage of
    'Codex Phillips' but of <hi rend="italic">every</hi> early Gospel
    manuscript.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P4"/>[4] The
    construction of the following <hi rend="italic">list</hi> is simple. The
    <hi rend="italic">lemma</hi> is taken from the Gwilliam’s Gospel volume
    (1901), followed by the variant of ‘Codex
    Phillipps’ (all orthographic variants are excluded). The
    evidence of the ‘Old Syriac’ manuscripts (Sinaitic
    and Curetonian) are constantly quoted (in red), their defective
    condition is indicated by <hi rend="italic">lac(una)</hi>. Peshitta variants
    taken from Gwilliam’s Gospel volume are added (in blue)
    to the quoted readings of ‘Codex Phillipps’.</p>

         <head xml:id="HV6N1Juckel5">Limitations</head>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P5"/>[5] The
    collation offers a total of <hi rend="bold">387</hi> items P<hi rend="sup">Ph</hi>
            <hi rend="bold">:</hi> P<hi rend="sup">Gw</hi> (the 21 variants in the supplemented
    portions not counted). This comparatively small number of
    variants derives from the fact that P<hi rend="sup">Gw</hi> is a
    majority text (based on forty-two manuscripts) and only the
    non-majority portion of P<hi rend="sup">Ph</hi> is quoted. To trace this
    individuality by a statistical approach, the agreement of
    P<hi rend="sup">Ph</hi> with other Peshitta manuscripts and with the
    ‘Old Syriac’ manuscripts respectively are to be
    counted. But the result of this ‘simple’ counting
    meets with considerable limitations due to the restricted
    accessibility to both the ‘Old Syriac’ and the
    Peshitta readings. While the ‘Old Syriac’
    manuscripts and most of the Peshitta manuscripts of the
    Pusey/Gwilliam volume are defective, a considerable part of the
    latter is only collated in part<ref target="#FN13">13</ref>. For example, in the
    Curetonian almost the whole Gospel of Mark is missing, in
    Gwilliam’s volume the Gospel of John is incompletely
    collated for many manuscripts. Both deficiencies affect the
    <hi rend="italic">list</hi> above. Therefore, the following statistical
    information (although not invalid) remains provisional and
    calls for supplementation in its Peshitta part drawn from
    additional collations<ref target="#FN14">14</ref>.</p>

    Syriac’, <hi rend="bold">117</hi> are not (in the <hi rend="italic">list</hi> in
    italics, incl. the 20 cases where SC are both defective). The
    origin of these totally unsupported variants cannot be traced
    conclusively; additional collations of Peshitta manuscripts
    hopefully will provide support for several of them. But it
    seems quite sure that the origin of these variants cannot be
    traced back to the Greek. Besides the <hi rend="italic">general</hi> better
    adaptation to the Greek which is characteristic for the
    Peshitta as against the ‘Old Syriac’, no
    <hi rend="italic">special</hi> Greek influence is responsible for the formation

    feature of this singular portion, however, can be identified as

    supported by one, two or three Peshitta manuscripts. I was able
    to identify 25 of these harmonistic readings, a harder attempt
    and thorough attention to the Diatessaric tradition surely will
    identify more. (Almost) unsupported harmonistic readings are
    not a special feature of ‘Codex Phillipps’, we also
    meet them, e. g., in Ms. no. 39 of Gwilliam’s edition,
    fully collated by W. Strothmann<ref target="#FN17">17</ref> (during a rough check I
    identified 15 harmonistic readings).</p>

            <anchor corresp="P11"/>[11] The
    statistical summary sets out the individual and singular parts
    of 'Codex Phillips' by giving a quantitative determination of
    their relation to the 'Old Syriac' and to the earliest
    manuscripts of the Peshitta Gospels. From this summary the
    following general results can be drawn:</p>
         <list type="ordered">
            <item>The primary result of this re-examination is a better
      knowledge of the variants preserved in ‘Codex
      Phillipps’, which are incompletely given in
      Gwilliam’s Gospel volume and in Allgeier’s
      article.</item>
            <item>Allgeier’s hint to the significance of this codex
      for the history of the Peshitta text the re-examination
      confirmed but modified and reduced to its proper dimension.
      By agreement and disagreement with the ‘Old
      Syriac’ the codex (in its <hi rend="italic">individual</hi> part)
      agrees with various Peshitta manuscripts. This agreement
      disposes of the codex’ supposed textual singularity; by
      its ‘Old Syriac’ part the codex rather shares in
      a typical (though individually developed) feature of the
      early Peshitta text.</item>
            <item>A considerable portion of singular variants <hi rend="italic">not</hi>
      supported by the ‘Old Syriac’ invites for further
      research. As several of them can be identified as harmonistic
      readings, the Diatessaric tradition of the Syriac New
      Testament is a possible source. But their singular
      attestation does not favor a ‘tradition’ behind
      these harmonistic readings. If singular harmonistic readings
      can be identified in many old Peshitta codices, theses
      readings should rather be assessed as a typical feature of
      the early text (of independent, non-Diatessaric origin).</item>
            <item>The re-examination of the codex advises scholars to
      re-examine all early Gospel codices in the same way
      ‘Codex Phillipps’ is re-examined in the present
      article. The analysis of the individuality of the single
      codices will determine their ‘Old Syriac’
      heritage as well as their singular and harmonistic
      readings.</item>

    Depending on the full extent and consistency of the ‘Old
    Syriac’ heritage thus determined, should Gwilliam’s
    majority text be altered by the adoption of this heritage in
    the printed text? This question cannot simply be answered in
    the affirmative for the following reason: Besides the
    <hi rend="italic">fading-out</hi> of ‘Old Syriac’ textual features
    during history we also have to expect the
    <hi rend="italic">(re-)introduction</hi> of ‘Old Syriac’ features
    into the Peshitta text during the co-existence of both
    versions. Accordingly, a ‘pre-Peshitta’ as a fixed
    text (to be reconstructed and printed)<ref target="#FN18">18</ref> cannot be taken
    as granted by the existence of the ‘Old Syriac
    heritage’; it is possible that a complex development of
    the formerly fixed <hi rend="italic">Peshitta</hi> enlarged or even produced
    this ‘heritage’ (as far as it is not identical with
    the Peshitta majority text). The complexity of the development
    is given by the influence of the ‘Old Syriac’, the
    Diatessaron and the Greek, which is tracable in the early
    Peshitta Gospel manuscripts. Therefore, to alter
    Gwilliam’s majority text by introducing the ‘Old
    Syriac heritage’ would charge this new text with the
    <hi rend="italic">petitio principii</hi> of a ‘pre-Peshitta’ which
    is not yet properly traced nor sufficiently discussed. Only the
    re-examination of the early Gospel codices can offer evidence
    about the textual reality or the textual myth of a fixed
    ‘pre-Peshitta’ and its possible future printed
    incarnation. For this more comprehensive re-examination the one
    of 'Codex Phillipps' offers a starting point. The true
    significance of this codex for the history of the Peshitta
    Gospels was not dicovered by A. Allgeier but by M.
    Black.</p>_______<lb/>

            <ref target="#FNRef5">5</ref> Gwilliam’s judgement is ruled by different
    terms, because for him ‘Old Syriac’ was lacking
    real textual evidence. His assessment of the Curetonian
    manuscript is illustrative: <hi rend="italic">‘It may be said that
    Cureton’s Syriac is related to the Peshitto in the same
    way that the latter is to the Philoxeno-Heraclean revision.
    This is certainly not true of the Curetonian in its present
    form. If, for example, we collate the Peshitto and Curetonian,
    (…),we find that in many verses the language is so
    divergent that comparism is impracticable. If we turn to other
    passages we discover that often the peculiarities of the
    Curetonian bear a greater ressemblance to the later than to the
    earlier Peshitto readings (…). It is freely admitted,
    that in investigations of this nature conclusions are
    provisional. Our opinion of the antiquity of the Peshitto would
    of course be modified by the discovery of other documents, and
    clear evidence of the type of text which was current before St.
    Ephraim’s days. Meanwhile, if we are to borrow terms from
    the West, the Harclean, and not the Peshitto, is the
    ‘SyriacVulgate’, the Peshitto is the ‘Old
    Syriac’, and not the Curetonian in its present form. An
    Ur-Peshitto may once have existed, and perhaps it provided the
    Evangelia out of which Tatian constructed his Harmony; but its
    ancient text still waits for the patient investigator or the
    lucky discoverer (...). Meanwhile, it is certainly premature to
    treat Cureton’s MS. as the basis of the Peshitto, and to
    quote it habitually as the ‘Old Syriac’. That term
    might fitly be applied to so much of the text of the Curetonian
    as could be shown to be older than the Peshitto text; but to
    apply it without reserve to the text of Add. 14,451 is to beg
    the question’</hi> (89-90). <ref target="#FNRef5">

    fixed text but a ‘type’ of text like the ‘Old
    Syriac’ with a range of textual incarnations, its
    heritage cannot be distinguished from the ‘Old
    Syriac’ nor from the Peshitta. According to M. Black
    the  ‘pre-Peshitta’ is a fixed text introduced
    by Rabbula of Edessa (see footnote 12). <ref target="#FNRef18">

            <anchor corresp="P1"/>[1] Scholars
    and graduate students presented a variety of papers relevant to
    Syriac studies at the North American Patristics Society (NAPS)
    annual meeting at Loyola University (Chicago) May 27-29, 2004.
    This year’s meeting featured two sessions related to
    Syriac Patristics. The growth in the number of students
    concentrating on Syriac related fields brought forth the
    beginning of a new group for graduate students of Syriac
    Studies: <hi rend="italic">Dorushe</hi>, which met for the first time. Both
    graduate students and scholars offered ideas and suggestions to
    promote the group.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P2"/>[2] In the
    first session on Syriac Patristics, three graduate students
    specializing in Syriac Early Christian Studies presented their
    communications. Senior scholars in the field offered their
    papers during the second session. Joseph P. Amar of the
    University of Notre Dame and Susan Ashbrook Harvey of Brown
    University served as the chairs for the two sessions.</p>

         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P4"/>[4] As
    exemplified in his hymns, St. Ephrem is a linguistic artisan
    who takes strands of tradition and weaves them together to
    create his own unique tapestry to illuminate the Scriptural
    text. It is in this manner that he expounds upon Genesis
    2-3 in his <hi rend="italic">Hymns on aradise</hi>. Like many of his
    contemporaries, Ephrem envisions paradise as a mountain with
    many levels, each assigned to believers of varying holiness,
    approaching the summit where the presence of God
    resides. This description of paradise invites Ephrem to
    elaborate on the text through a variety of scriptural
    metaphors, such as the image of paradise as a
    temple. Neither the concepts involved nor this comparison
    itself are unique to Ephrem. The idea of the cosmic
    mountain reaches back to the ancient near east and stands
    behind the association of three key mountains of religious
    significance—Sinai, Zion, and (arguably) Eden—in
    the Hebrew Bible. Ezekiel provides an example of the link
    between the temple and paradise, an image further elaborated
    upon in later texts such as Revelation and <hi rend="italic">1
    Enoch</hi>. The <hi rend="italic">Book of Jubilees</hi> includes this
    temple imagery in the retelling of Genesis 2-3, envisioning
    Adam himself as a priest, a theme also appearing later in the
    Syriac <hi rend="italic">Cave of Treasures</hi>. The motif of Christ as
    the High Priest in the Epistle to the Hebrews also provides an
    important link between the earthly and heavenly
    temples. What is unique to Ephrem, however, is his
    adaptation of these various traditions as he meditates upon the
    biblical story of the Fall in poetic form, interweaving
    Adam’s Eden with Israel’s temple and ultimately
    Christ’s Golgotha. In this way, Ephrem beautifully
    embroiders the Genesis story with other Scriptural layers to
    show the true depths of the biblical text.</p>

         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P5"/>[5] Ephrem
    the Syrian demonstrates a strong concern for pastoral
    instruction in Eucharistic texts. This paper investigated
    how Ephrem, a bishop’s assistant to the Nicene
    communities of fourth-century Nisibis and Edessa, shows his
    involvement in parish life in hymns and homilies, exegesis and
    instruction. Current events and crises of the fourth
    century Syrian Church shape Ephrem’s Eucharistic
    teaching. His language of healing draws out divine
    instruction from ordinary natural world and is the instrument
    of his ministry to the Nicene community. Though Ephrem is
    a great poet and theologian, he is also a humble
    <hi rend="italic">mshamshono</hi> in dedicated ministry to the communities
    and bishops he serves. Attending to the pastoral strain in
    Ephrem’s Eucharistic theology reminds the historian of
    the context out of which Ephem’s hymns and homilies on
    the Eucharist emerge. </p>
         <head xml:id="HV7N2CRSaintLaurent5">The Meaning of Sabbath Rest in Aphrahat and

         <head xml:id="HV7N2CRSaintLaurent6">Susan E. Ramsey, Marquette University</head>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P6"/>[6] As an
    initial stage towards understanding the significance of the
    terminology for rest in Syriac and Greek, this paper examines
    the use of this terminology in two writings on the Sabbath by
    Aphrahat (<hi rend="italic">Demonstration XIII</hi>) and Macarius (<hi rend="italic">Homily
    II.35</hi>). The paper discusses background information on
    Aphrahat and Macarius, definitions of the Greek and Syriac
    words for rest, the contents of these two texts, and an
    analysis of the relationship between rest and Sabbath according
    to these two texts. The contours of the terminology engage some
    key theological concepts including soteriology, Christology,
    harmatiology, pneumatology, and eschatology, as well as the
    ontology of Eden. This study builds an initial foundation for
    the author’s dissertation topic that will explore the
    meaning and function of Rest in the Macarian Corpus.</p>

         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P7"/>[7] In
    <hi rend="italic">Vigiliae Christianae</hi> (1997) and in <hi rend="italic">Journal of
    Theological Studies</hi> (1998), Alastair Logan argued for the
    existence of a post-baptismal anointing with muron in parts of
    the “great church” of second-century Syria and Asia
    Minor. Logan adduced especially three texts: 
    Ignatius’s Letter to the Ephesians 17.1, the blessing at
    the end of the Coptic <hi rend="italic">Didache</hi> 10.7, and the version of
    this prayer in <hi rend="italic">Apostolic Constitutions</hi>
    7.27. Ignatius’s Letter to the Ephesians, however,
    says too little about the anointing practiced in communities he
    judged orthodox to witness to a post-baptismal muron rite in
    these churches. In addition, Logan’s argument that the
    Coptic prayer refers to ointment and is an original part of
    this document fails to answer sufficiently too many questions
    and counterarguments found in the literature on these
    points.  Finally, his argument for supposing that
    <hi rend="italic">Apostolic Constitutions</hi> 7.27 proposes a ritual
    innovation considered essential by the redactor depends on the
    misreading of some passages and on the false assertion of
    multiple interpretations of the baptismal muron in this
    work.  Cyril of Jerusalem, Chrysostom, and
    Theodore’s homilies help to show that the redactor of the
    <hi rend="italic">Apostolic Constitutions</hi> expressed a unified
    interpretation of this rite.  Thus, Logan’s
    hypothesis still lacks convincing evidence.</p>
         <head xml:id="HV7N2CRSaintLaurent9">The Redemption of Potiphar’s Wife in Syriac
    Tradition</head>
         <head xml:id="HV7N2CRSaintLaurent10">Kristian Heal, Brigham Young University</head>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P8"/>[8] The
    character of Potiphar's wife was developed in considerable and
    diverse ways in Jewish, Christian and Muslim retellings of the
    story of Joseph. Though studies have been devoted to this
    figure in Jewish, Muslim and Medieval Christian sources, the
    Syriac tradition has received little attention. The three
    pillars of the tradition, the homilies of Aphrahat (fl. mid 4th
    C), a fourth century prose narrative mis-attributed to St.
    Basil, and the prose commentary of Ephrem (d. 373), each
    develop the character differently. Likewise, each of the later
    sources, Narsai (d. 502), Jacob of Serugh (d. 521) and the
    collection of 5th and 6th century dramatic dialogue poems,
    recreate the character to meet their own purposes. This paper
    considered the diversity of portrayal of Potiphar's wife in
    these 4th to the 6th century sources. To illustrate one of the
    trajectories of interpretation, the paper focused in on the
    theme of the redemption of Potiphar's wife, looking in
    particular at how this narrative expansion entered into and
    developed in the Syriac tradition.</p>
         <head xml:id="HV7N2CRSaintLaurent11">Will the Body be Raised? Resurrection Theology in
    Early Christian Edessa</head>
         <head xml:id="HV7N2CRSaintLaurent12">Ute Possekel, St. John's Seminary</head>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P9"/>[9] This
    paper compares the resurrection theology of Bardaisan and
    Ephrem. The former taught that the soul alone would be raised,
    whereas the latter argued for the resurrection of body and
    soul. The different eschatological models provided by Bardaisan
    and Ephrem are rooted in their respective theological systems,
    constructed to respond to the particular challenges of their
    day. For Bardaisan in the early third-century, this was the
    problem of astrology: his response was a theology that drew on
    Greek philosophical paradigms, locating human identity in the
    soul. As a consequence, his eschatology stressed the
    resurrection of the soul. For Ephrem in the fourth-century, by
    contrast, the main challenge was dualist groups. He replied
    with a world-affirming theology, emphasizing the biblical
    concept of the human person as a psycho-somatic unity. In
    Ephrem's time, moreover, the Edessan church had become strongly
    ascetical and was confronted with the experience of martyrdom,
    factors which contributed to his emphasis on a bodily
    resurrection.</p>
         <p>
            <anchor corresp="P10"/>[10] The
    papers presented in both sessions and the interesting
    discussions that followed fostered and confirmed a growing
    enthusiasm for Syriac Studies within the larger field of Early
    Christian Studies. Next year’s meeting will take place
    one week later than usual, June 2-4, 2005, at Loyola
    University.</p>
